The US government has a guide [here](https://studentaid.gov/h/understand-aid/how-aid-works) on aid available to students. \n\n- UK universities do not generally offer any sort of financial aid to incoming international students. The understanding is that you will bring over funding from your own country. Most Americans I know studying here are taking out FAFSA support - have you looked into that? The US government has a guide [here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/international) about funding study abroad. \n\n- 15k USD would probably cover your tuition at a very low ranking uni here, but not living costs. You probably don't want to go to a lower-ranking uni if you want to find a job here afterwards.\n\n- Budget for four years of tuition, not two. Transfer applications are not very common, and many of your associates credits will likely not be accepted for transfer if they're not focused on your major.
