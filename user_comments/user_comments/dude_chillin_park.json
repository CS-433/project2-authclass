You've been told all your life to follow instructions and love for others. So putting yourself first is one of your big shifts into adulthood (doesn't matter how old you are, we all hang onto certain childish patterns).\n\nYou like being cozy at home? Nothing wrong with that. Accept the fact and then figure out how best to enjoy that time at home. Work remote and earn money? Study to improve your skills? Make beautiful dinners or draw cartoons? It's ok to do what makes you feel good, and make that the first priority.\n\nThe rest of the things you need to do to live can fit in around that. You might make more money or less at a job that's slack or intense, part-time or full-on. You might make a lot of new friends sometimes, or just coast on a few for a while. As long as you have those core things you enjoy, you don't need to pressure yourself about the rest. If you're lucky, some of them will work out-- like your boyfriend has for you. \n\nFor me it's creative writing. I started taking it seriously last year after too many years of thinking I had to find a stable job and home first. I'm not treating it so seriously that I'm pressuring myself to make it a career, but the commitment to do it every day and identify with the practice is giving me a deep sense of stability that helps me laugh off obstacles like shitty jobs, personal betrayals, sudden expenses, etc. Maybe I'll get lucky and figure out how to get paid for it, but even if I don't, I'll die happier one day knowing I didn't hold it in.\n\nOne thing you should be mindful of is not completely relying on your boyfriend. You don't have to imagine him gone, but try to be a fun and interesting person without him so that he can stay interested in you. And if something did happen to him, it's really helpful to have other stable things in your life (job, friends, passion project) to give that energy to. Resiliency is a form of safety.\n\nEveryone likes to recommend therapy. That's because a therapist can give you a lot more time and focus than we can here.

Both can be uncertain about trust.

Friends can be healing when you disclose yourself. Not like a therapist, but just letting it out and including them in that deeper part of your life. Be careful to build a good relationship with people based on fun and respect before you ask them if you can process feelings with them. But don't wait forever. \n\nOn the other hand, if you have trouble making friends, you might want to try seeing a therapist regularly. It's like you pay someone to help you practice building a relationship, a healthier kind of relationship than you had with your parents, so you can go on to do it with new friends. It can be expensive, but seeing them every two or three months might be enough. If this doesn't sound like the right path, please pursue the path of art!

The origins of Surt seem to have been at the very beginning of the kozmos, amongst the first primeval fires of Muspelheim. This primacy has been interpreted as signifying that, in the pre-\u00c6sir and pre-Vanir pantheons, Surt was originally a god of some great importance, perhaps in partnership with Hela.\n\nSurt rules from deep in the dales of Muspelheim, the home of dry earth, and is also its sentinel, standing at its gate and brandishing his fiery sword.\n\n\"Great Surtur, with his burning sword,\n\nSouthward at Muspel's gate kept ward,\n\nAnd flashes of celestial flame,\n\nLife-giving, from the fire-world came.\u201d\n\nFor Muspelheim is the realm of creation, and destruction, out of it emerged the sparks that were set in the sky as the stars, and two fire-disks that were harnessed to a twin set of chariots and travelled across the sky as sun and moon. As such, Surt also possesses this creative potency, his is the fire of invention, but more importantly, he is the spirit of such creation. In Rokkr kozmology, Loki is identified with the element of fire, and thus while Surt is a potently fiery being, it is the spirit that underlies this existence which is better appreciated as his element. Surt is the summation of the Rokkr spirit, his very essence is one of creation and destruction. He exists from the beginning of time, it is his realm that brings forth the stars and the sun and moon, it is from his realm that the primeval fire arose to meld with the primeval ice of Nifelheim in the void of Ginungugap, but it is he who finally destroys all that Nature has created.\n\nAt the end of the battle of Ragnarok on the field of Vigrid, Surt throws his fiery brands throughout the heavens, earth, and the nine worlds, setting the entire kozmos alight.\n\n\"Fire's breath assails\n\nThe all-nourishing tree,\n\nTowering fire plays\n\nAgainst heaven itself.\"\n\nAll life is destroyed, except for those few who are hidden within the hollows of the World Tree, and those other beings who are purest expressions of Wyrd. Surt also survives, for as fire he cannot be destroyed by fire, and the Rokkr spirit of creation and destruction must continue into the new world as a manifestation of kozmic law.\n\nSurt, and his many children, the sons of Muspel, were in a constant state of enmity with the \u00c6sir gods from the dawn of time. Understandable given the premise that they were of the old gods who became superseded, and subsequently demonized, by the \u00c6sir; as is often the case with emerging mythologies. \n\nThis animosity was further enhanced when Odin attempted to enter Muspelheim, in search of the lunar mead which had been brought into the fiery realm by Ivalde. The mead of the moon had been given to Suttung, the paramount son of Surt, and in return, Ivalde was given the hand of Gunilad, the daughter of Suttung, in marriage. But, Odin sneaked into Suttung's hall, which lies deep within a mountain, and has one entrance in a vast abyss, guarded by a fierce dwarf. Assuming the guise of Ivalde, Odin seduced Gunlod in order to find where the lunar mead was hidden. Once Odin recovered what he sought, and had used Gunlod, he fled, and for this was known as Bolverkin or Evil-Doer. It was this indignity upon the Sons of Muspel and the family of Surt, that ensured they would wage war against the \u00c6sir on the field of Vigrid at Ragnarok.\n\nThe kozmos is essentially justice-seeking, as is the Rokkr spirit exemplified by Surt.\n\nSeveral points reflecting the important role of Surt, both in instigating the fire the consumes the worid, and as a god of some primacy and significance, are mentioned by the Vedic scholar Richard Thompson, in his book \"Vedic Cosmography and Astronomy\". He describes Surt as \u201cthe king of eternal bliss, at the southern end of the sky\", and remarks on similarities between him and the Hindu kozmic serpent Ananata (Infinite) or Sankarsana, who also destroys the world with fire, and is known as tamasi (dark), just as Surt is known as The Black.\n\nThompson also quotes one source that says \u201cthere are many of good abodes and many bad; best is to be in Gimle with Surt\". Gimle is the name of one of the few places in the world that survive the fires of Ragnarok, and shelters the survivors in the regeneration that follows. Appropriately, it is at the southern-most point of the sky, the domain of Surt, and thus it is apt that he is described as residing there in the new-time, having himself been reborn in his own fires.\n\n*From R\u00f6kkrbok by Gydja*", "created_utc": "1665816927.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ise1iop", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y4bcfb", "parent_id": "t1_isdgvgh", "score": "7", "subreddit": "paganism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnw5"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "Loki  \nAngrbo\u0111a  \nHel  \nFenrir  \nJ\u00f6rmundgand  \nSurt  \nNi\u0111hogg\n\nThe list is based on who other giants swear oaths to in the Eddas.

This shows that you're reliable, dependable... in other words, you like it boring and safe. You'd probably rather eat a cake than ride a roller-coaster.\n\nTaurus is ruled by Venus, and indicates sensual comforts: pleasant music, soft pillows, thermostat just right. With Saturn here, your itch to leave all this behind to seek excitement is limited. You're mature before your time, and youlegitimately enjoy sensible things. \n\nVenus' other sign is Libra, and hey look, there's Venus herself! Libra is the other side of Venus: shiny new things. Libras like to party, shop, and talk. This isn't your personality, it's just your Venus, your method of attracting attention. But look at that dotted line to Saturn. These planets in these placements don't understand each other at all. Saturn tells Venus that spending money on f*ck-me outfits isn't sensible, that flitting from one new friend to another is a waste of time. This isn't even a conflict (like a square aspect), it's just a failure to communicate effectively. \n\nWhy is Saturn winning when Venus is in her own sign? Because of that other dotted line to Pluto. Venus and Pluto are working together to focus on Saturn. Pluto is your generation and it's ability to make a new philosophy for the world...I don't know how you're involved in that, but it's part of the dynamic here too.\n\nIn addition, Venus is in the 8th house (whole sign). This indicates that you want the universe to drop what you want into your lap, rather then strategize to get it. If it's really meant to be, it will be effortless, right? \n\nWhat do you do about it? Hmm... power through. Tell yourself that a little bit of hijinks *is* sensible-- and necessary to break old habits and find new opportunities. Don't think of this Saturn vibe as a problem, because it's a strength. But recognize that it can be a rut, and needs your higher self to give it a kick sometimes.\n\nAnd look... what's happening right now is that you're at your first Uranus square-- it's square to where it was at your birth. And in your case, it's also transiting your natal Saturn. \n\nUranus indicates major phases of our life mission. Many great works of art and invention are done during Uranus squares and oppositions. For you right now, this shift involves that Saturn energy. You either just had a major life event, or you have one coming up. Let that event change your mind about what it means to be safe and comfortable.\n\nThat might mean pushing yourself to date in a new way. Or it could mean realizing a partner isn't as important as the projects you're already doing. What else might it mean? \n\nStrengths to help you:\n\nMercury sitting right across from Saturn. You know how to find the truth, but you like to keep it secret. You can see how to solve the problem, but you don't like the implications of it. Believe yourself. You can actually change your mind later, even if you do stuff now. \n\nSun-Moon trine. This beautiful aspect tells me your emotions guide you to the right place, whether they feel good or bad. You have a good idea of when to push and when to let go. \n\nJupiter in Aries, square Mars in Capricorn. You have a lot of power within you when you really go for it. You might even scare yourself sometimes. Jupiter's quincunx to the sun suggests that going for what you want doesn't feel authentic to you. But it is: you're allowed to want things, and you're allowed to plan and take action until you get them. You're even allowed to ask for help. People actually like you more after they do you favors. \n\nTl;dr (though I hope you did read it): your Uranus square can be a time of change in your life, and you'll find a new way to find the happiness and connection you want.\n\nPlease let me know what sounds right and what sounds ridiculous.

Possibly an entertainer/influencer, inventor, analyst, or even sales. I see you coming up with real solutions to problems as well as being able to convince others they need your product. \n\nThis is a really powerful chart, with the sun, Mercury, and Mars in their own signs. \n\nSun in Leo in the 1st house: personal magnetism. \n\nMars in Aries: all the self-motivation (watch out for frustration that others don't move as fast as you)\n\nMoon in Libra: the moon can always be dangerously emotional, but if managed correctly, this can give you genuine connections with others and good networking skills\n\nAnd of course, that Jupiter. If you used a clock-based house system, it would likely be in the 10th, meaning the world is seeing you as a keen and dynamic operator, able to get things done and share the wealth (especially knowledge).\n\nWith the Gemini (and Leo) focus, I suggest following business ideas based on knowledge and your own skills, rather than manufacturing or importing or something. But even then, you'll be able to find ways to improve the process and help the business. \n\nWith Aquarius ruling your 7th house (and both of Aquarius' rulers in Sagittarius), you might benefit from a business partner who is really \"out there\" and lets you take the \"realist\" role. \n\nYou have 2 obstacles, shown in the red lines.\n\nFirst of all, a T-square to Mars from Venus and Neptune. To sum up in one word: idealism. You have plenty of energy, but nothing is good enough for you to commit to. Your personal desires and vision of a better world seem hopeless to actually fulfill, so you don't try. Maybe avoid this by realizing a commitment doesn't have to be forever, just until the project is ready to be outsourced or sold. Give yourself a timeline to an exit. \n\nSecond, the Mercury-Jupiter square. Though Mercury is at its best in Virgo *and* rules Gemini (good), this aspect causes overthinking. To make your ideas work, you'll need to take that expansive vision from Jupiter and crunch numbers on the daily: sit down with a notebook and write, mind map, follow a business plan model, whatever... something to externalize some of that mental action. This can become a really useful aspect, but requires regular effort.\n\nYour big challenge in life is Saturn. In Sagittarius, Saturn gives you a feeling of being lost in the universe, without a philosophical ground to stand on. You focus on practical things to mask your fear of the deep unknown. With Uranus conjuct, this struggle is part of your life's work, though not necessarily part of your career. Trine to the sun is lucky! It means your philosophical battles can profit you in your life, even though you'll never be truly satisfied with the answers you get, and keep seeking. \n\nPlease let me know if any of this sparked insight or confirmed your own evaluation!

I appreciate your thoughtful disagreement. \n\nYeah, land back is an activist movement, not a political party, so I don't expect you to treat it like a party. But parties lay out elaborate policy promises during the campaign, and then forget them to curry favor with shell corporations funded by Russian oligarch money, so I don't think that model works either. \n\nIn my mind, LB is not a promise of utopia, but a check-engine light. *Look at these alternative ways of being in the world that magically make a bunch of problems disappear. Stop driving your car thinking only about speed and travel time; start looking under the hood and seeing how it works.*\n\nI'll take housing as an example. Why are we in a housing affordability crisis? Not because we ran out of land, but because our economy runs on real estate as a vector of wealth creation (especially in Canada), which encourages hoarding and market failure. The wealthy few (investment funds) are able to own massive amounts of housing, while it is unaffordable to the majority. If housing were managed for the benefit of the people, the priority would be people having homes, not boosting GDP. You'd still pay way more to live in downtown Vancouver than in rural Manitoba, but in neither place would you compete with thousands of airbnbs and speculators. How is this related to Land Back? Because speculating in housing is inherently a colonialist mindset that sees money as more real than life, and it can only happen when a broken fictional economy gives massive power to very few individuals. There's no five-year plan to implement this now, but let's strategize with this in mind, and hold our political parties to this standard. \n\nPlease tell me what you know about your examples of hereditary chiefs abusing their power. I know in the case of Wet'suwet'en, the elected chiefs exist within a corrupt, settler-imposed democracy to rubber stamp industrial development, while the hereditary chiefs are the ones fighting for land rights and sovereignty-- because their authority comes from the culture of interconnection with nature that LB is trying to promote.\n\nAFAIK, the Pachedaht situation is similar, at least I'm mostly familiar with Bill Jones, who isn't any kind of chief but who is once again fighting the band government elected by the imposed Indian Act system. \n\nI don't think Attawapiskat has hereditary chiefs, but I assume you're referring to them being audited by the feds. I believe the chiefs requested that audit and worked with the feds to improve their bookkeeping practices, which has greatly improved the standard of living on the res.\n\nIndigenous bands and nations have to live within capitalism like the rest of us: support third-world slavery in order to have phones, overheat the atmosphere in order to get to work, etc. So of course there will be voices that support pollution for profit. LB isn't about putting indigenous people on a pedestal and feeling bad for being a settler. It's about listening to indigenous ways of knowing the world in order to solve our problems-- which seem insoluble with our capitalist systems, but magically disappear when you start with the right values. Intelligent indigenous and settlers must work together against ignorance and greed. We should pay attention to the ways of living that were developed over thousands of years on this land (Turtle Island or whatever you call it), *as well as* the great developments of European thought. \n\nBut that's what it means to me; I guess there's room for many positive voices in the movement, and I hope it facilitates many people meeting, listening, and going on to take action in their own ways.

You don't need to shut off your mind when you meditate: your mercury is in its own sign along with the sun, so you have a gift for analysis and strategy. But try to let go of any pressure to perform. The world isn't even real, it's all made up. Conventional success-- like owning things-- is worse than pointless: it's a trap for your soul. Let yourself get lost in your own imagination as much as you can afford. You might find some treasure in there to share, after all. \n\nTo that matter: Saturn's placement helps you structure and describe new ideas-- especially those that create new and better possibilities-- in practical ways. You might share your daily practices that keep you healthy and sane, and they might be useful to others. You might need to find the sweet spot between letting go (12th house) and sticking with something that seems almost hopeless and idealistic (Aquarius). Your Gemini sun and mercury give you a gift for balancing contradictions. \n\nSounds great, right? \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd85", "created_utc": "1657182300.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if6ly1s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vtcv5v", "parent_id": "t3_vtcv5v", "score": "3", "subreddit": "astrologyreadings", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yyht"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "In astrology natal charts, being born in the day improves the sun, Jupiter, and Saturn (while being born at night improves the moon, Venus, and Mars).\n\nIn my opinion, Jupiter and the Sun are both omni-gender, high-energy planets, though some might code them masculine.\n\nYou might have a look at your own natal chart to see how the sun and Jupiter interact! https://www.astro.com/cgi/chart.cgi (put in your birth info, message me if you have questions)", "created_utc": "1657148796.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if4xikv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vswejv", "parent_id": "t3_vswejv", "score": "3", "subreddit": "chaosmagick", "subreddit_id": "t5_2usek"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "No AIDS but lots of terrorism.", "created_utc": "1657128586.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if3l98m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vsqcr3", "parent_id": "t1_if31iov", "score": "3", "subreddit": "GenX", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qur9"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "RIP Mike Tool", "created_utc": "1656915623.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iesf2dj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vqq8w2", "parent_id": "t3_vqq8w2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MetalMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t1af"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "So you prefer to never see any change because it's temporarily uncomfortable?

I think that name is fairly recent and the association may be ersatz.\n\nBut the connection of the Greek god Cronos with the harvest is much more compelling, and he wields a scythe or other harvest implement, just as the modern Father Time does. Clearly, harvest is related to the *cycles* of agriculture, as well as to the *end* of life, in the sacrifice of the plant's life during harvest. \n\nCronos/Saturn also represents time in the sense of generations and parentage, having killed and usurped his father, only to receive the same treatment. Though this appears to be a repeating cycle, it is in fact a linear narrative that leads to the present (has Zeus since been usurped?).\n\nWe can talk about two sides of the time coin. One is time's cyclic nature: day follows night and the seasons of the year repeat. The other is linear: an arrow points always towards the future and never the other way, and what's done is done. Perhaps we can say the Moon and Saturn-- the inner and outer spheres of traditional planets-- represent these two faces, like the extremes of time's possibility, while the other planets partake in both qualities to their own extents. \n\nAnother question we might ask regarding time is: which planet represents Memory? Without memory, we could still observe cyclic time, but linear time-- history-- would have no meaning.

Saturn isn't the progress of time, it's the rules of the universe that time doesn't affect. Death is in the future, it's true, but not in time, but at the end of it.\n\nTime has many flavors, and each planet represents an aspect of it. Astrology is about time and nothing else, really. Each planet has its cycle, and *something* happens according to that clock. Saturn happens to mark eras of our lifespan, as does Uranus. So while Saturn shows us a process of aging and maturation, that's not our most fundamental appreciation of time. \n\nFrom our human perspective, what planet offers us the conscious appreciation of the passage of time? **The moon**. It's big and bright, you can't miss it. And it changes at a time scale that's just right for distinguishing one day from the next.

You want to love and be loved more intensely than is even possible (Leo 5th house Mars), but you also see how much effort it is to be in a relationship and deal with someone else's baggage (Aquarius moon). Uranus conjuct the moon in its own sign is boosting the Aquarius energy; you might feel like an alien on this planet sometimes, and want to avoid messy human things. Since the Moon is in the 11th house, you might resolve this by taking on a cause (like volunteering for charity or standing up for human rights, think betterment of all humanity). If your (potential) partner feels strongly about the same cause, it might help you feel more connected to them and not so ambivalent about getting attached. \n\nExplore the theme further with Venus. Venus rules your 7th house (Libra), so loving relationships are so important to you that you may have trouble settling for just one partner. Maybe let yourself date casually without putting too much weight on it. Just don't move faster than you're truly comfortable with. No touching is OK, no sleepovers is OK, etc. You make the rules always (and respect their rules too, of course). Both these paragraphs makes your Virgo sun happy: you want to do things the right way, and not cause harm.\n\nAdditionally, Venus has aspects to Saturn and Pluto. These outer planets can indicate bad experiences in relationships. The aspects aren't super prominent (compared to the other ones I describe), but your soul senses the possibly, and fears letting in someone who might hurt you or who you might lose. To turn this energy good, let your relationships be transformative yet deeply authentic (Pluto), and mature (Saturn... that is, make good decisions, ones your parents would be proud of).\n\nYour Sun is square Pluto, and this will be important in your life. You might go through a difficult time (get a proper reading to find out when), even make some bad decisions, but this experience will help you let go of ego and get in touch more deeply with yourself. This may involve relationships, it may not. It may involve that humanitarian cause, it may not. Your Jupiter in Pisces is very strong, and indicates ability for powerful art, expression, and intuition that goes beyond even your own life. So when life gives you bumps, use them to engage and feel more deeply, and turn that energy around into your chosen expression, even if it's a struggle to expose your heart. Don't expect to be appreciated (or paid) every time (or even most of the time), just go with your flow. \n\nI hope some of what I wrote helps you find insight.

This means that every effective ideology has a certain space of inherent transgression built inside of it that gives subjects a sense of freedom and distance from their ideology. This, of course, is a very subtle trick on the part of ideology and its mechanisms. It simulates a space outside of itself which only serves to keep us locked into the ideology we take ourselves to be at a distance from. For example, American ideology creates all sorts of spaces that seem to be either non-ideological or anti-ideological. These spaces include or have included rock concerts, bars, strip clubs, protests, unruly sporting events, comment sections on the internet, etc. People can go to these establishments and \u201ctransgress\u201d, but this is inherent transgression, that is, a form of enjoyment (jouissance) that seems to transgress the rules of Law/ideology, but actually only serves to make us more subservient to it, more invested in it.

Does time affect things' existence? How do we know when something stops existing? Our intuition tells us that things continue to exist as time goes on and even through their changes, but for some, this can raise logical issues. Philosophers have understood the universe through certain sets of fundamental truths which either confirm or barricade the truth of any theory proposed, but what happens when some explanation must be created, and no matter what, one of them will contradict some fundamental rule of the universe, as understood for ages? Time and the persistence of objects has stumped minds like Heraclitus, who stated that you cannot step into the same river twice around BC 500, and Lewis, who said that something persists through time if and only if it exists at various times. Some theories have been deliberated and debated, arguably two of the most prominent being perdurance and endurance. These theories attempt to explain how objects persist through time and their relation to change, holding their own sets of logical workarounds and foundational beliefs. The different schools of thought on how time exists in the universe could lead people to agree with one of them, specifically one\u2019s views on the role of the present moments in existence. Given a personal belief in the present moment being inherently important to the existence of time, endurantism describes a more accurate view of persistence through time than does perdurantism.\n\nAs mentioned before, two schools of thought on what time actually is may lead philosophers to lean toward either theory for the persistence of time although by no means do they pigeon-hole them. The prominent ideas for what time is are heavily influenced by the debate on the importance of the present. Presentism can be used to explain that only the present moment exists and is a fundamental part of the universe and all things existence while eternalism says that the present moment is unimportant (or even that it does not exist) and that all events in the strict sense can only be described in relation to other event, with no relation to the \u201cpresent moment\u201d. These are fundamental concepts for understanding perdurantism and endurantism and how they relate to each other.\n\nSo what is perdurantism? A perdurantist believes that things persist through time as a multi chromatic paint stroke exists on a canvas. As the line of paint changes colors across the canvas, it does not stop existing, rather one part may be red and another blue. Just as one part being red is not in contradiction with another part being blue, so to a candle being bent at one time (one temporal part) and being straight at another does not contradict itself. This is thought of as a worm through time in four dimensions. Each segment of the worm represents a different temporal part, but the whole of the worm continues to exist.\n\nEterenalists might lean toward perdurantism because of its claim for the existence of temporal parts of an object existing at different times. If all time exists, an object which changes to have an incompatible property cannot be wholly present being both P and not P, rather one part is P and one part is not P. Therefore, the object can persist through time in this way.\n\nThen what is endurantism? An endurantist believes that an object is wholly present at all times at which it is said to exist. There are no temporal parts or different things by which other theorists explain the object's existence in the past or future. An object just is and any change to an object is expressed in tensed language, i.e. the statement \u201cThe apple was green\u201d can change to the statement \u201cThe apple is red.\u201d Although not all endurantists are presentists, this way of explaining change allows presentist-endurantists to maintain the thought that nothing other than the present moment exists, thus avoiding the problem of contradictory properties along with not having to deal with the problems that come with the existence of objects that are not \u201ccurrently present.\u201d\n\nTo understand how the theories work and where each fails in their ways of expressing persistence through time, Haslanger provides a puzzle. The puzzle contains a candle which was set on a shelf in the morning. Due to the sunlight from a window, the candle is bent later in the day. The question has several parts, most relevant being how can a candle have both the intrinsic property of being straight and the intrinsic property of being bent. The way that a perdurantist would explain this is by saying that the temporal part of the candle in the morning is straight and the temporal part of the candle that exists later in the day is bent. The candle continued to exist by way of its temporal parts and the alteration coincided with a new part of the candle through time. This requires an explanation of temporary intrinsics, wherein lies the heart of some objections to perdurantism. Temporary intrinsics are the properties of an object that the object contains in itself with no environmental or any such outside relation. To define the part of the candle that has the property being bent or being straight requires the use of temporary intrinsics and although this explanation has also been used in some forms of endurantism, it is flawed. How can an intrinsic property, which by definition has no relation to anything outside of itself be considered in relation to time? The candle at time t is straight in relation to t, but bent in relation to t2. So then, in what sense are these really intrinsic properties? Perdurantism must deny or rework the proper-subject condition in order to explain how an object itself alters but it falls short due to the succession of temporal parts not being true alteration.\n\nEndurantists (it is important to note that only in the presentist view) explain the puzzle with the way of thinking that the candle, being wholly present in the morning has the property of being straight simpliciter. In other words, in the morning when it was straight (note tensing) it just had the property of being straight and when later in the day comes around after the sun had bent the candle, the candle now just has the property of being bent. This may seem convoluted, but presentist-endurantists ride on the wings of simplicity and thrive in the avoidance of \u201c4D time worms\u201d and \u201ctemporal intrinsics\u201d and such making the claim that these complicate what really should be a simple explanation.\n\nTo explain the simplicity of endurantism to those holding onto convolution and heavily explanatory reasoning, I will use an even simpler example. Say you are on a swing. When you were up, you were up at the time you swung back, but now you are down (swinging forward) because in the present moment the swing is down. There is no need to convolute one\u2019s thinking with temporary intrinsics because you were up at a now past time, not in relation to that time but at that past time. So too, now you are down due to the simple fact that in the present moment (remember, this is the only time that exists) you are down. This reasoning is called Copula-Tensing. \n\nCopula-Tensing has faced its own criticism for its strange wording and similar appearance to relational properties. Adverbialism (although a separate type of wording for endurantism, it goes hand-in-hand) is one way endruantists could explain the difference between Copula-Tensing and temporarily relational properties (the specific type of temporal intrinsic that those in objection refer to) by saying that you were \u2018back-swingingly\u2019 up and then \u2018forward-swingingly\u2019 down (note the \u2018adverbness\u2019 of these words) or, in the case of the candle, morningly straight and afternoonly bent. It is difficult to use this explanation \u201celegantly,\u201d as Haslanger puts it, but it does its job in undermining the objections to the simple use of tense that endurantists have in their arsenal.\n\nThis topic is not a simple one to deliberate to those unfamiliar with the subject, but endurantism holds its proponent thinkers in a sweet cradle of simplicity. Perdurantism claims to offer explanations for a plethora of obstacles to the explanation of the persistence of time, but it nonetheless fails to explain the heart of the matter, alteration.

Its most interesting points were two earlier books who take a different-- if not incompatible-- view (quotes from the linked article):\n\n*Hierarchy in the Forest* by Christopher Boehm, 1999\n>Human beings are undoubtedly capable of seeking to dominate others, but they are also innately predisposed to resist being dominated, and wherever possible will band together to repulse those who would subordinate them. In Boehm\u2019s view, whether a society became egalitarian or hierarchical depended on whether the material conditions within that society advantaged those with a will to dominate or those who resisted being dominated. Our early societies were egalitarian, he argued, because the conditions they lived under favoured coalitions which could resist domination. One example of such a condition was the invention of projectile weapons which could be used by everyone, large or small, male or female, to undercut the physical strength possessed by alpha males. This resulted in a state of reverse dominance, or counterdominance as it is now more commonly called.\n\n*Mothers and Others* by Sarah Hrdy, 2009\n>Humans differ from their great ape cousins in one very noticeable respect: they give birth to big-brained babies. Human brains including the brains of infants gobble up calories at a furious rate, and human children mature slowly, remaining dependent on their caregivers for many years. In the Machiavellian world of our close cousins, chimpanzees, with its alpha males and hostile, shifting alliances, no mother could or would trust her infants to another female and certainly not to a male. In the human world by contrast, mothers could not cope with feeding and bringing up their children alone. If humans were to survive, they would have to develop co-operative childcare arrangements, something we invariably see among egalitarian hunter-gatherer peoples. Among great apes, males are the leisure sex. The only contribution they make to the next generation is a dollop of sperm. In human societies, that was no longer feasible. Mothers needed help from their own mothers and from the rest of society, males and females alike. Humans, Hrdy argued, are evolved co-operators.", "created_utc": "1651562745.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i74son4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uguh9k", "parent_id": "t1_i71w8ba", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Anarchy101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s960"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "I had already learned Chinese and was using it to brush up, so I may not be a typical learner.

Almost all your Saturn transits happen during this time. Saturn transits feel like restriction, responsibility, limitations, and other things imposed on you from outside. They can also feel like locking down your identity, giving up the freedom of potential for a little bit of whatever you actually choose to be (many people have defined their career by the time of their Saturn return).

But this recent one was much bigger. And it involved bigger forces, as Saturn transited your outer planets along with everyone else your age. And you'll go through it all again in your 50s.\n\nI wonder if you had some events six years ago, then a break (during which you were recovering and adapting to the new reality), then another event recently (pandemic) as Saturn hit your generation's Uranus and Neptune (redefining how y'all use technology and fantasize by locking you in your homes).\n\nGood news? Saturn passed your mercury in Aquarius recently, meaning you're pretty much done until your Saturn return: you've had all the shocks, now you get to define who you're going to be, knowing what you now know about the world.

Gemini itself encourages looking at things logically. The many planets between Mercury and the Sun suggest that a lot is coming between you and your thoughts. Mercury is the ruler of Gemini, so it's a dominant force in your chart.\n\nThe **Mercury-Mars conjunction** gives your thoughts the style of a debate-- you can be defensive and stubborn, but it's because you really believe in your ability to evaluate evidence. Due to 5th house, you have a more playful attitude with this: you're not *destroying your opponents*, you're teaching them like you would a child. Not surprisingly, some enjoy this more than others, and it can especially be a barrier to intimacy. \n\n(Note that in a Placidus house system, your stellium would be in houses 3 and 4: around your IC, where we keep our private lives. You may identify more with these energies through family, as well as adult family in the form of co-workers and classmates,\nrather than the generally playful business I described. This brings your debating attitude more into the professional realm and your own childhood.)\n\nIn either case, the conjunction's aspects to 3 outer planets suggests this could lead to big transformations in your life: things that impact your career and friendships-- for example, getting fired in order to find your true calling, or spoiling a close relationship in order to gain insight into yourself. \n\nOn the other hand is the other side of Gemini: changability. With retrograde Venus between your sun and moon, you can be very idealistic and emotional, but not so expressive of those emotions. You respect curiosity and engagement in other people, and judge them when they don't share your spirit of inquiry. \n\nWith Chiron and the north node in Libra, relationships will be something you have to think about and figure out. Balancing your own thoughts and judgements with the needs of other people isn't your strong suit now, but it's something you'll become an expert in as life goes on.\n\nYour Aquarian energy (including Uranus on your AC) means some people will just dismiss you as a weirdo, and one of your challenges is to just respect them anyway, instead of trying to convince them you're right-- sometimes. With Neptune in the 12th, watch out for nightmares or paranoia. This is because you avoid dreaming about things that aren't realistic (Capricorn), so those things can come back to haunt you.

Communists aren't making money on social media, even though there are a lot of communists out there, because communists are poor.\n\nMGTOW grabs a similar demographic as porn does: single men who aren't giving their time and money to a partner. It tells them what they want to hear: it's ok to be angry, that's manly; it's not your fault, it's society's and women's; you can break out of your unhealthy patten... by following my advice-- subscribe!\n\nI'm not saying that MGTOW influencers are cynical liars. I think the majority are genuinely interested in seeking truth and helping other men, and many of their insights are worth integrating. I'm saying that selection pressures allow the MGTOW message to be more prominent than other voices offering other solutions to society's problems.\n\nOn the one hand, people speaking a message that attracts money will keep doing it, while those who don't make money will have to spend their time doing something else.  On the other, related, hand, people will respond to their audience and speak on topics they want to hear. (I've watched the transformation of Jordan Peterson since 2014. He used to talk about the Jungian symbolism in Pinocchio. But he discovered this social media phenomenon and ran with it. He is one of the cynical ones: he laughed on Rogan about how he has \"monetized social justice warriors,\" so that he makes more money the more they attack him.)\n\nThere always has and always will be a war between the sexes. I recommend you watch [Sapolsky lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D) instead, next time you feel tempted to watch MGTOW (skip down to the sexual behavior and aggression ones if you already know how biology works).\n\nBut there's also always a magnetic pull between them. It's true that traditional marriage has broken down. Good riddance! It was an insane, abusive, religious scam. If you want a relationship, you have to negotiate your own terms and stand up for your own boundaries, rather than expecting patriarchal institutions to give you the upper hand. This is the core of truth in MGTOW. It's not enough to be a man; you have to discover your own way of being a man. \n\nLastly, there's an older alternative for men called the Men's Movement. Rather than hating women, it's based on bringing men together to talk about things we care about. It's a hash of elementary Jungian archetypes and quasi-indigenous symbols filtered through non-violent communication techniques. But it's potentiality better than that sounds, and much better than a bunch of dudes sitting alone in their rooms, paypalling money to some other dude who's blaming problems on the fact that women are allowed to decide and look out for their own best interests.\n\n[Patrice O'Neal](https://youtu.be/opbpBEGR9po) is all the MGTOW you need.", "created_utc": "1650793805.0", "edited": "1650793988.0", "id": "i5zetkb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uaiga4", "parent_id": "t3_uaiga4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "conspiracyNOPOL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2emz4i"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "I skimmed your profile and don't see anything indicating you like to be active or outdoors. \n\nBut I'll assume you do.

You might see marriage as a business arrangement, and if you come to peace with that, then you might get married. But honestly, you might get more out of business partners. Saturn also indicates success late in life, so you might get married when you're older (than what's common for your culture). \n\nYour nodal axis tells me you'll learn to have fun slowly as you get older. Your south node is in the 11th house, making you comfortable and natural with ideals and causes, less so with individuals. The north node in the 5th house says your mission in life is to learn to play, to be creative, to be childish. You might feel compassion for children or animals, and your journey would be from feeling to work, and the work will become playful and bring you joy. \n\nVenus trine Pluto (though it's a wide orb) says you have some relationship trauma. Maybe you're afraid of getting close to people, or maybe you're attracted to dangerous people. It's a trine, not a square, so I don't predict violence or abuse. But you'll have to be brave if you want to find love. There might be a power imbalance, maybe through money, age, or kinky play. These things can be healthy if you're careful. \n\nWith 7th and 8th houses in Aquarius, eccentricity is important to how you relate to others. You might contribute to a humanitarian cause or a niche fandom-- something abstract that's more important than marriage. With Leo also ruling two houses, including your rising, you can be a leader or a spokesperson for your cause. With Scorpio and Taurus intercepted (no house), both sexuality and sensuality are difficult.

You're born into a generation watching the cracks in society start to leak. For you (and many others), it's hitting you in the wallet. \n\nBut I bet you're not homeless. Pluto opposes its sign ruler Mars in the 8th. Your ambition is likely convincing you that you're poorer than you really are. You might be overspending (eg. if you still live in California).\n\nBoth planets in this opposition are square to Mars's sign ruler Venus in Aquarius. You value ideas and concepts over practical work. With your sun and mercury in the same sign, and your sun in the 5th house, you might assume your intellect will bring you success. You have the chart for that, but you need to harness your ambition and trauma into it. In a T-square, you channel the power of the opposition into the squared planet: in this case, your masculine force into your feminine expression. Then we take note of what's opposite-- Leo-- to see what's missing: you need to make yourself the center of attention, maybe even lead with anger or trauma to show your vulnerability. \n\nWith the moon in your midheaven (which indicates your public image), you might be emotional in public. Of course you want some control over this, but it's also an asset to you if you're a performer of some kind. Consider a career that would make your mother proud, or something that reminds you of your childhood with your mother (hopefully good memories, but either way).\n\nWith sun square to Jupiter, you'll likely not stick with one career or identity for your whole life-- whether by choice or circumstance. Possibly, you'll be conflicted between accepting good financial opportunities and sticking to your ideals. I suggest you loosen up on those ideals, many of them may be attachments rather than ethics. Challenge yourself to leave your comfort zone in ways you haven't done before. You consider yourself open-minded, but you also play it safe about certain things. \n\nWith a bunch of planets in Saturn signs, you prefer caution over impulsivity. With Saturn opposite the moon, there's a mother-father conflict here. The Mars-Venus square reinforces this, creating some gender tension in your life, likely in sexual relationships. Consider how you rebate to the opposite sex, how you express your own gender, and how the different lessons you learned from your mother and father inform your ability to take risks. \n\nGood luck out there, and feel free to continue the conversation. \ud83c\udf08 \ud83e\udd85", "created_utc": "1644980352.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hx4hsy1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_stju6r", "parent_id": "t3_stju6r", "score": "3", "subreddit": "astrologyreadings", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yyht"}, {"author": "dude_chillin_park", "body": "I think you're misunderstanding.

How do we consider a hypothetical united Africa or European federal state? \n\nThe section talking about post-2014, comparing Ukraine's treatment long ago by the Polish to their current relationship to NATO, is revealing.

It's cheaper to make posters telling customers the coffee is ethical than it is to actually treat workers fairly and use sustainable farming practices. He says the virtue is part of the product. Customers pay Starbucks prices because they're suggestible; on some level they believe they're helping others as they feed their caffeine addiction. \n\nI don't know if this answers your question.

Even the socially left policies they're willing to discuss during primaries, like universal health care and anti-racism, aren't things they do in practice. \n\nAs Zizek says, the left today has an inferiority and persecution complex.

His argument was simple: Democracy would win out over all other forms of government because the natural desire for peace and well-being set nations on a path to progress from which it was impossible to divert. If a state\u2014even a Communist state\u2014wished to enjoy the greatest prosperity possible, it would have to embrace some measure of capitalism. Since wealth-creation depends on the protection of private property, the \u201ccapitalist creep\u201d would invariably demand greater legal protection for individual rights.\n\n>As many critics pointed out, Fukuyama\u2019s logic was a bit too reminiscent of the pseudo-Hegelian historical determinism that Marxists and Fascists deployed to disastrous effect earlier in the 20th century, but when his article appeared in The National Interest, it was hard to disagree with him. The Berlin Wall was about to fall, the Soviet Union was collapsing, and the world was clamoring for the consumerist boom in an orgy of free-market excitement. Everything seemed to suggest that only liberal capitalist democracy allowed people to thrive in an increasingly globalized world, and that only the steady advance of laissez-faire economics would guarantee a future of free, democratic states, untroubled by want and oppression and living in peace and contentment.\n\n>Today, it\u2019s hard to imagine Fukuyama being more wrong. History isn\u2019t over and neither liberalism nor democracy is ascendant. The comfy Western consensus he inspired is under threat in ways he never predicted. A new Cold War has broken out. China\u2019s \u201cMarxist capitalism\u201d suggests you can have wealth without freedom. And the advance of ISIS may herald a new, state-oriented Islamic fundamentalism.\n\n>But most disturbingly, the connection between capitalism, democracy, and liberalism upon which Fukuyama\u2019s argument depended has itself been broken. In the wake of the credit crunch and the global economic downturn, it has become increasingly clear that prosperity is not, in fact, best served either by the pursuit of laissez-faire economics or by the inexorable extension of economic freedoms.

In a way, we never leave her bosom, and death is like birth from her body into an unknown world. \n\nWith agriculture, the focus of collective intention is on the intelligent control of time in order to manipulate the earth. The act of planting a seed is easy to compare (quite literally) to the male part of sexual reproduction: putting something inside the womb/earth and then leaving it to develop. \n\nThus, the male becomes both the principle of intelligent control and the creator. The female becomes a passive container upon which He can choose to act. \n\nDespite much dialog on restoring balance to gender roles in society and in metaphor, we (in Western culture and others) still tend to live as if the earth/universe is a passive field in which we, as immaterial and rational souls, may plant our seed. We resist acknowledging that the feminine is an equal part of our consciousness, let alone acknowledging that the universe itself is conscious.

I don't expect to find anything praising American policies, because I can find that elsewhere. They would be wasting their precious time. Their bread and butter is telling me things I won't hear elsewhere. \n\nIt seems a lot of the anger towards Max comes from his tweets. I'm not on Twitter, so it's hard to care.
