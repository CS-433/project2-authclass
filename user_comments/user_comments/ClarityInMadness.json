Then P(A\u2227B)=P(A)\\*P(B)=10%\\*100%=10%. So even then the probability that someone is both a redditor and earns more than 100k is equal to the probability that he just earns more than 100k.

The formula for calculating decrease in memory stability after a lapse, S = S0^(-f\\*L). There are issues with this. First of all, why is the base stability used, and not the last value of stability, before the lapse? That would make *a lot* more sense. Think of 2 cards, one has been reviewed 2 times and the current interval is 5 days, the other has been reviewed 20 times and the current interval is 30 years. Which one has S close to S0, and which one has a much greater value of S? For the first card it may make some sense to use S0 rather than the previous value of S, for the second card it makes no sense, unless you assume that \"lapse\" is equivalent to \"forgetting everything about this card\", as if you had amnesia. [And I'm not the only one who thinks that \"lapse\" is not the same as \"literally forgot everything about this card\"](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Post-lapse_stability), Woz says \"*In the ideal case, for simple memories, forgetting results in a reset of estimated stability back to near-zero. In theory, only difficult items made of composite memories may show a substantial decrease in the costs of re-learning, however, even that does not show in data*\". Second of all, since S0 is a constant and f is a constant, that means that post-lapse stability is a function of only one variable - the total number of lapses. That feels overly simplistic and not sufficient to describe the change in memory stability, maybe somehow adding D to this formula would be better. But that's a pretty mild concern compared to resetting stability completely aka using S0 instead of Si-1.\n2. Is it possible to do away with learning steps and re-learning steps, or at least let the algorithm optimize them for the user? A lot of people are agonizing over choosing the best learning steps, and ideally that shouldn't be happening. So either the whole \"learning steps\" thing needs to be thrown out the window, or learning steps must become optimizeable parameters.

But their *words* didn't change the data in front of your eyes. You still see two reports, both say \"100 patients, 80 cured, 20 not corued\". The words that came out of their mouths did not change the reports, not even 1 bit (well, unless the words are \"I made these results up\").\n\nAnd if that is *still* not convincing enough, imagine that person 1 wants to win the lottery, and he is determined to consecutively buy 100 tickets no matter what, even if he wins immediately after buying just 1 ticket. Person 2 decides to keep buying tickets until he wins (or until he runs out of money, whichever comes first). And it just so happened that they both bought 100 tickets in total and both won exactly once. Each of them spent the exact same amount of money on tickets (say, $100, $1 per ticket), and each one won the exact same amount of prize money (say, $10 000). So in both cases they gained $10 000 - $100 = $9 900. No matter what their thoughts about this ridiculously unlikely coincidence are, they both walked away with the same amount of money after the same number of tries.\n\nYou know, maybe I shouldn't have included this question in the survey, since it's more about science in general and not some quirk of the probability theory.", "created_utc": "1664199414.0", "edited": "1664199696.0", "id": "ipyw30o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xogszz", "parent_id": "t1_ipytyb0", "score": "3", "subreddit": "SampleSize", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tlqg"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Please only read this after you're done with the test.\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\nQuestion 1, or The Conjunction Fallacy\n\nThe probability that both A AND B are true is always less than or equal to the probability of either one of them being true. P(A\u2227B)\u2264P(A); P(A\u2227B)\u2264P(B). Informally, let's say 10% of all people are earning more than 100k dollars per year, and let's say 5% of them are using Reddit. Then the probability that someone is earning more than 100k and uses Reddit is P(A\u2227B)=P(A)\\*P(B)=10%\\*5%=0.5%. Now suppose that every single person who earns more than 100k uses Reddit. Then P(A\u2227B)=P(A)\\*P(B)=10%\\*100%=10%. So even then the probability that someone is both a redditor and earns more than 100k is equal to the probability that he just earns more than 100k. In fact, each added detail would actually make the scenario less likely. [A Venn diagram can help you to understand it more intuitively.](https://i.imgur.com/5I554At.png)\n\nQuestion 2, or Insensitivity to sample size\n\nThe smaller the sample size, the more likely it is to observe large fluctuations in data due to random chance. See [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). 6 (or more) babies being boys and 4 (or less) babies being girls is more likely than 60 (or more) babies being boys and 40 (or less) babies being girls. So it's more likely that a small hospital would report a large deviation from the expected value (50%). This is also why in real life you should always be vary of studies with like 10-20 test subjects that report revolutionary, ground-breaking results.\n\nQuestion 3, or \\[\\] Fallacy\n\nOk, this one doesn't have a specific name. Also, while it's about probabilities, it also exposes your attitude towards science in general. **Facts don't care about your thoughts**. That's why the right answer is that we should treat both results equally. If you think that one of those results is more trustworthy, then you are saying \"The importance of the exact same data depends on researcher's private thoughts\", and that is erroneous. You might say \"But it's not possible for 2 different stopping rules to produce the exact same results: N=100, n(cured)=80\". Nope, it's possible, although highly unlikely. You can run a computer simulation if you know how to code or just know Excel well. You might say \"But these 2 stopping rules are not equivalent, on average the results will be different!\". Yes, *on average* these stopping rules don't produce the same results, but that's not what the question is about. It's not about which rule is more scientifically rigorous or whatever. It's about whether you trust data A or completely equivalent data B more, and obviously you should trust two equivalent sets of data equally. Also, this is based on the assumption that neither researcher would stoop as low as to falsify the data or lie about their methodology, which may not be true in real life.\n\nEDIT: damn, people are doing way better on the question about two hospitals than I thought. 15 out of 15 got it right so far.\n\nEDIT 2: ok nvm, now it's 24/26.

Look at the long [\"Stability updating formula after successful review\"](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler) formula, there is a term D^(-b). This seems very counter-intuitive. A large value of D corresponds to an easy card, but thanks to that formula it will produce a very small change in stability. A small value of D corresponds to a difficult card, but according to that formula it will change stability a lot.\n\nFor example, let's say b = 0.7. If D = 10 then D^(-b) = 0.1995; if D = 1 then D^(-b) = 1.\n\nSo if a card is easy stability changes less than if that card was hard. That is very counter-intuitive, in fact in my experience it's exactly the other way around - intervals for easy cards grow fast, so the corresponding stability must grow fast too, and intervals for hard cards grow slowly, so the corresponding stability must grow slowly too.\n\nSo the question is why is the formula designed in such a way?", "created_utc": "1663833333.0", "edited": "1663833550.0", "id": "ipfxri0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xhfl0p", "parent_id": "t1_ipbr1gk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "What about love then?

A terminal goal is something that you want to do just 'cause you want to. An instrumental goal is a \"means to an end\" kind of goal, it's what you do to achieve your terminal goal.\n\nExamples: your terminal goal is \"become a rockstar\", your instrumental goal is \"practice playing the guitar\". Your terminal goal is \"raise a good child\", your instrumental goal is \"help your child to study\" or \"teach your child to be kind to other people\" or whatever. My terminal goal is \"find a gf that loves me\", so my instrumental goal might be \"use Tinder\" or \"ask my friend to hook me up with his female friends\" or something like that.\n\nChanging your instrumental goals is relatively easy. Changing your terminal goals is...honestly, I'm not even sure if it's possible. Usually people aren't going to even consider doing that. I mean, try telling a mother \"Stop caring about your child and start caring about something else\"\" and see how she reacts. Or try telling a person who enjoys playing videogames \"Stop caring about videogames and start caring about something else\".\n\nNow, for incels getting love or sex (or both) is a terminal goal, so I highly doubt that an incel is going to consider changing it. And even if someone is willing to consider it - like me - I don't think there is a reliable way to do so. At least I haven't been able to find one, just like how I can't find a way to convince myself that the sky is green (not like I *really* tried to convince myself the sky is green for longer than 1 second though). And even if someone was willing to change their terminal goal **AND** there was a reliable way to do it, I would suspect that it won't lead to happiness, and instead will lead to mental health issues.\n\nSo this whole text is basically a very long way of saying \"telling incels to stop chasing sex (or love) is about as useless as shooting the sun with a water gun\".", "created_utc": "1663770921.0", "edited": "1663772856.0", "id": "ipc3l8w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xjn7dk", "parent_id": "t3_xjn7dk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "IncelTear", "subreddit_id": "t5_2kchui"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Ah, ok.

Why is it \"not friendly for average users\"?

I believe that a good spaced repetition algorithm should only have 1 user-adjustable parameter - recall rate, as you call it - so that users won't have to worry about fine-tuning anything manually while still having the option to choose whether they want higher recall rate and therefore higher workload aka number of cards per day, or lower retention rate and lower workload.\n\nAlso, some formulas on [this page](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler) [aren't displayed properly](https://i.imgur.com/VsODpDK.png), you may want to fix that.\n\nAlso, it may be a good idea to explicitly tell users to turn off any other add-ons that change Anki's scheduling algorithm, such as the Auto Ease Factor.\n\nEDIT: wait, I'm confused, there is a `const requestRetention` thing, can I set it to 0.85 or some other value if I want to?

That would mean that the way dating works suddenly and very abruptly changes the moment you go online (ok, I could *maybe* believe that, since you don't actually talk face-to-face) or the moment you organize an event where people can meet and call it \"speed dating\" (now this would be really freaking weird). That would also mean that the halo effect somehow doesn't affect dating success, despite the fact that attractive people are, indeed, seen as more intelligent/successful/morally virtuous/etc. \n\nSo in conclusion, it seems much more likely that looks affect any form of dating and we can make a reasonable extrapolation from all the studies about online dating, speed dating, and the halo effect, and we won't be too far off the mark, than a sudden sharp change in human behavior that only appears in some specific contexts.\n\nWe have to make **a lot** of assumptions in life, and with time you learn to anticipate which assumptions are more likely to be correct, and which are less likely. We have 2 assumptions:\n\n1) Looks matter, and studies about speed dating, online dating and the halo effect at least somewhat support this assumption\n\n2) Looks don't matter, and couples with ugly folks (as well as couples where both partners have a deep emotional bond, not just a shallow attraction based on superficial things like money/status and looks) at least somewhat support this assumption\n\nIn which case are you more likely to get kicked in the butt by Ms. Reality while she laughs \"Ha, you're wrong!\"? Now, different people will likely give different answers to this question, but I would say that number 1 is more likely to be true. A more simple example would be \"Do you think that aliens have never contacted humans and people are just making stories up, or that aliens have only contacted specific individuals while putting a lot of effort into evading 99.99999% of humanity and destroying 99.99999% of evidence of their presence for some reason?\".

When incels have never kissed, in many cases never even held hands with a girl on a date, and never had anything that could even remotely be described as a \"romantic relationship\", they also use the same word - \"loneliness\". But their circumstances are completely different. \"I had a gf a year ago and we broke up\" and \"I have never been in a relationship all my life, not even kissed or went on a date\" are fundamentally different. The biggest problem isn't even that the gap exists, but rather that **nobody realizes** that it exists. If an incel said \"You've never felt lonely in your life!\", a normie would respond with something like \"Of course I did! I had no girlfriend for 1 year!\", and then that normie will genuinely wonder why his response made an incel angry if they both have experienced loneliness.\n\nForgive me for making such an exaggerated analogy, but it's like when a rich guy says \"I've been poor too, I know what it's like! Back in my college days I had to spend $5000 on rent, I couldn't even afford Starbucks coffee every day!\", and then actually poor people are like \"Just shut the fuck up dude\".\n\nYou might ask \"So you just view life as a suffering contest, where whoever suffers the most should be awarded some special treatment?\". That's not what I'm saying. My point (which is pretty much the exact point the guy from the screenshot is making) is that both sides should be aware of these fundamental differences.\n\nBtw, I am **not** advocating for laying down and rot, since that obviously isn't going to make anyone less lonely. I'm also not saying that loneliness justifies things like rape or \"government-mandated gfs for incels\".\n\nAlso, I was reading a different comment while typing this, and the guy raised a good point - emotional response.

Maybe it's because my FPS occasionally dropped to 59, but I didn't notice any issues with parrying, so idk.\n\nEDIT: Bloodhound's Step has 41 i-frames, Caestus parry has 5 active frames.\n\nEDIT 2: Golden Parry has 13 frames on small shields...and 14 on medium shields. Again, tested 3 times, analyzed 3 different attempts (6 in total, 3 attempts on a small shield, 3 on a medium shield).

Curved swords have 5 active parrying frames.\n\nEDIT 5: Quickstep has either 30 or 31 i-frames. Dodge-related stuff keeps being inconsistent.\n\nEDIT 6: Tested other daggers, they are the same as the Parrying Dagger - 9 active frames.\n\nEDIT 7: I didn't know that you can replace Buckler Parry on buckler, so I replaced it with Golden Parry and Carian Retaliation - 14 active frames in both cases. The animation is slightly different, however, so it seems that Buckler Parry also comes with a unique animation.\n\nEDIT 8: Windy Crystal Tear has the exact same effect as the Crucible Feather Talisman - 31 i-frames for fat rolls, 32 or 33 i-frames for fast rolls, and their effects **do not** stack. For the sake of clarification - extra frames come near the end of the animation, after the \"innate\" i-frames, not before them.\n\nEDIT 9: Claws and Thrusting Swords also have 5 active parrying frames.\n\nThere is so much new info that tomorrow I'll probably make a new post summarizing it.", "created_utc": "1648991239.0", "edited": "1649007214.0", "id": "i37wgaj", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_tv8uof", "parent_id": "t3_tv8uof", "score": "68", "subreddit": "Eldenring", "subreddit_id": "t5_122hf1"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "I would agree if you were talking about it in light of the manga ending tbh.

Personality might be what gets someone to actually take the time to give you a second look and determine you are attractive.\n\nYes, that's what I said. Looks are necessary to start a relationship, personality is necessary to maintain it. I think we both agree on this.\n\n>Looks can be the attraction that gets one into a relationship.\n>But the idea that a woman would start a relationship purely on looks alone, nah bro\n\nAm I missing something or did you just contradict yourself?\nMan, just when I thought that we can both agree on this...\n\n>Your more likely to get a ONS or a FWB if it\u2019s purely physical than a relationship.\n\nI never said it's purely physical, come on.

I used to think that it's bullshit too, but I've changed my mind. The more I talk to incels and normal people, the more I realize that there is a huge difference between how normal people and incels see the world, particularly how they react to evidence that looks are objective and not subjective, as well as evidence that looks play a huge role in dating. Incels accept that ugly reality, while non-incels claim that studies that show these effects are pseudoscience, or even say that looking at dating through the prism of statistics is fundamentally wrong, no matter how rigorous these studies may be. And even if you don't like scientific studies for some strange reason, there is plenty of other evidence as well. Take [this](https://imgur.com/a/je7yu6q#uXXpIYd) for example, **100+** screenshots of women saying bad things about short men. You don't need a PhD to understand what this means for a short guy who wants to find a girlfriend.\n\nIt's true that incels sometimes misinterpret these results in an overly pessimistic way. Like \"on average women prefer taller men\" gets twisted into \"if you are short - it's over, you are unlovable\". But even taking that into account, an average incel still has a better understanding of reality, while a normal person will cover their eyes and ears and keep saying that looks are subjective, or that they play a very small role when it comes to dating, or both.\n\nBasically, normal people live in a bubble of happy self-delusions. People aren't shallow, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, etc. A perfect example of blissful ignorance.\n\nA few important notes. \n\nFirst of all, I don't condone misogyny, or any kind of violence towards women.\n\nSecond of all, I don't think that I, personally, cannot find a girlfriend because I'm unattractive (I have a different problem), but I do believe that it's a huge problem for many other people who have it much worse than me.\n\nThird of all, I do realize that personality is important, but it's only important if the woman that you want to date thinks that you are physically attractive. **Looks allow you to start a relationship, personality allows you to maintain it.** If a woman doesn't find you to be physically attractive, then your personality is irrelevant.  You can become friends, but not lovers. No woman or man would date someone if they think that person looks ugly, unless it's an arranged marriage or something similar.\n\nIf you have good looks and a good personality - you will find a romantic partner and live a happy life. \n\nIf you have good looks but a bad personality - welcome to either the \"angry misogynistic incels\" club or to the \"wife beater\" club, depending on how your bad personality manifests.\n\nIf you have bad looks but a good personality - welcome to the \"sad lonely incels\" club.\n\nIf you have bad looks and a bad personality - welcome to the \"angry misogynistic incels\" club, part 2.\n\nFinally, do I think that incel's worldviews and normal people's worldviews can be reconciled (without the \"legalize rape\" or \"government should provide me a girlfriend\" type of stuff, of course)? *Maybe*, but normal people would have to accept the truth that looks matter immensely in dating, and so far it seems that they are unwilling to even read the evidence that clearly shows it.

Personally, I've never even met a blind woman in my life (maybe I saw one passing by on a street at some point in my life, but I mean like actually knowing in person).", "created_utc": "1639939556.0", "edited": "1639941271.0", "id": "hp75027", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rk11vl", "parent_id": "t3_rk11vl", "score": "14", "subreddit": "IncelTear", "subreddit_id": "t5_2kchui"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "It seems like there are 2 distinct categories of users - the \"I like literally any woman who isn't morbidly obese\" category and \"this model has small tits, she's too skinny, overall shit\" category.", "created_utc": "1639937338.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hp6zfva", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_rk1r9q", "parent_id": "t1_hp6ymud", "score": "151", "subreddit": "IncelTear", "subreddit_id": "t5_2kchui"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Women only like one type of guys - tall, muscular, and with a specific kind of face, aka Chad.

How would you do that?\n\n1. You want to know if his endurance is good, so you would make that person run a 10 km marathon.\n2. You want to know how fast he can run, so you would make him sprint as fast as he can.\n3. You want to know if he can lift heavy things, so you would give him a barbell and make him do some deadlifts.\n\nEventually, after the person has done a lot of exercises, you would look at his performance and get a *general* picture of his level of physical fitness. Now here is the question: if a person performed significantly above average in every exercise, would he become a good football player? *Maybe*. We don't know because there are other factors, such as how passionate he is about football or if he is good at working in a team. But it's safe to say that, all other variables being equal, he is **more likely** to become a good football player than someone who performed below average on every exercise.\n\nWe can make something like that for intelligence too. Let's say you want to measure someone's intelligence.\n\n1. You want to know if he is knowledgeable, so you ask him stuff like \"How tall is mountain Everest?\" and \"What's the capital of Italy?\".\n2. You want to know how good his language comprehension is, so you give him a bunch of words and ask him to explain their meaning.\n3. You want to know if he is good at mental arithmetics, so you ask him stuff like \"The old TV costs 2/3 of what a new one costs. New TV costs 600$. How much does the old TV cost?\"\n4. You want to know if he's good at abstract thinking, so you give him some abstract puzzles and see how quickly he can solve them.\n5. You want to know if his working memory is good, so you say out loud a sequence of random digits and then ask that person to recite them.\n\nYou see the point that I'm making, right? After the person has done a bunch of tests you will get a *general* picture of his cognitive capabilities. Now, will that person become a good engineer? *Maybe*. There are other important qualities that will affect his success, but all other things being equal, the person who scored above average across the board is **more likely** to do complex work better than someone who scored below average.\n\nThe tasks that I've listed above are from the [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale) (WAIS), which is considered to be the gold standard of IQ tests by psychiatrists. Also, don't try to find a \"free online\" version of WAIS, it has to be administered by a psychiatrist (it's used for diagnosing intellectual disabilities btw).\n\nAnother example of an IQ test is the [Mensa Norway](https://test.mensa.no/) test, which only tests your abstract reasoning. It's not necessarily a bad test, it's actually quite good at measuring abstract reasoning, especially for above-average people, but it's only one way in which intelligence can manifest, so the test is far from being comprehensive. It's like if we only measured physical fitness by how fast a person can sprint.\n\nNow, to my knowledge, no IQ test in the world measures creativity or social aptitude (well, WAIS has a \"comprehension\" subtest that is kinda related to social skills, but I wouldn't say it's a great measure of social skills). But IQ tests do measure other aspects of intelligence, and they measure them:\n\n1. Reliably, aka your scores on the same test will be close to each other each time you take a test, and scores obtained on different tests that measure the same thing via a different method will agree with each other.\n2. Validly, aka they measure what they are designed to measure, and not some random crap.\n\nAnd many studies have shown that IQ scores do correlate with stuff like academic performance, job occupation, the chance that a person will get into a car accident, the chance that a person will commit a crime (yes, high IQ individuals tend to be somewhat more law-abiding), etc. IQ is not the only factor that affects your success (or lack of thereof), but it's one of the factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: IQ is not a perfect measure of intelligence, it has obvious pitfalls, such as not measuring creativity and social aptitude, or the fact that different IQ tests measure somewhat different things and it's kind of a clusterfuck. But it still has its use cases (like diagnosing intellectual disabilities) and it does explain **some** of the real-world success, just not all of it.", "created_utc": "1622993314.0", "edited": "1623000940.0", "id": "h0sxhh4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqovuq", "parent_id": "t1_h0br2vd", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "If you're an anime only and want to avoid spoilers, then coming to a subreddit that literally says \"**MANGA SPOILERS SUBREDDIT!**\" in the description probably wasn't a great idea in the first place.", "created_utc": "1622911092.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0p9yhi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nst893", "parent_id": "t1_h0p8qi1", "score": "9", "subreddit": "titanfolk", "subreddit_id": "t5_ioe0d"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Well, he once said that MHA fights are dull.

Don't really know how different people with an IQ of 40 are from those with an IQ of 50.\n\n50 - moderate intellectual disability. Cannot read (maybe can recognize individual letters), cannot live independently, and require care and assistance.\n\n60 - mild intellectual disability. Can do very simple, repetitive work under supervision and will likely require assistance with basic tasks (like taking a bath) for the rest of their lives, although the level of independency among mildly intellectually disabled individuals varies.\n\n70 - mild intellectual disability. Can do manual labor and integrate into society (after finishing a special school), usually can live independently. Bottom 2% of the population (in terms of IQ scores).\n\nKeep in mind that IQ is **not the only** criteria when it comes to classifying people as intellectually disabled.\n\n80 - \"slow learners\". Will have trouble finishing high school. Can become miners, gardeners. Bottom 10% of the population.\n\nBased on Hima's baka moments (\"Aren't the sun and the moon the same thing?\" and \"So there really is lava underneath the ground, just like in Minecraft?\"), and based on how she performed on the Mensa Norway test, my wild mass guess would be that she is around 80-75. But that's just a guess.\n\n90 - slightly below average. Bottom 25% of the population.\n\n100 - average. If your IQ is 100 then 50% of people have an IQ higher than you, and 50% of people have an IQ lower than you.\n\n110 - slightly above average. Can benefit from higher education. Top 25% of the population.\n\nPeople in the 90-110 range can become car mechanics, plumbers, office clerks, policemen, electricians, etc.\n\n120 - if you have a master's degree, your IQ is probably around this level. Can become pharmacists, material and design engineers, etc. Top 10% of the population.\n\n130 - people with PhDs, lawyers, etc. Top 2% of the population.\n\n140 - genius level. IQ of Nobel Prize laureates starts from here. I don't know if there exists a specific job such that the average IQ of people who do it for living would be 140 or even more. Top 0.4% of the population (1 person per 250 people).\n\n150 - Nobel Prize winners, Nobel Prize winners and...uhhhh...Nobel Prize winners? Idk what people do at this level, other than pure academics and scientific research. Top 0.04% of the population (1 person per 2 000 people).\n\nI suppose Etna is around 150. She maxed out on Mensa Norway, but struggled with 2-3 final exercises, so she's probably 145-150. Damn, Etna is insane.\n\n160 - the ceiling for most IQ tests, aside from maybe tests made **by** the members of high IQ societies, **for** the members of high IQ societies. Top 0.003% of the population (1 person per 30 000 people).\n\nSources: *\"General mental ability in the world of work: occupational attainment and job performance\"; \"Meritocracy, Cognitive Ability, and the Sources of Occupational Success\".*\n\nNote: psychiatrists don't use the Mensa Norway test. The gold standard of IQ tests is the [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale) (and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children), which is widely used in many countries for diagnosing intellectual disabilities. It goes as high as 159 and as low as 41.\n\nAlso, the further away from the average you are, the less accurate the final number that the test gives you is. To be honest, I have serious doubts when someone claims that their test can reliably tell apart a 160 IQ (one in 30 000) rare genius from a 170 IQ (one in 650 000) ultrarare genius, which is why I'm skeptical when it comes to high IQ societies. Even telling apart 150 and 160 is a little sketchy. If you **ever** hear someone saying \"My IQ is above 160\" or \"That famous scientist/entrepreneur/artist has an IQ above 160\" just truncate it to 160, since anything beyond that is practically immeasurable. Purely theoretically, 195 is the maximum possible IQ, it would correspond to roughly one in 8 billion people. So someone on Earth *might* have an IQ of 195, but we will never know.\n\nAnother note: \"But wait, my IQ is 100 (average), and I'm an engineer at a nuclear power plant!\". IQ determines some of your success, but not all of it, there's always some variance due to other factors like your conscientiousness, optimism and creativity. That being said, I would be **really** surprised if someone who is an engineer at a nuclear power plant had an IQ of 100.\n\nYet another note: Mensa Norway test is specifically designed to be accurate for above average folks, so it's not a good test for Hima. Also, it only tests abstract reasoning. WAIS, for example, tests your verbal comprehension, working memory, visual-motor skills, processing speed when it comes to abstract puzzles, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading my rant about IQ on a subreddit about funny anime girl streamers.", "created_utc": "1622824257.0", "edited": "1622840585.0", "id": "h0l1e87", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_ns97s5", "parent_id": "t3_ns97s5", "score": "14", "subreddit": "Nijisanji", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ef8gf"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "I was more surprised by the:\n\n\\- Btw, doctors said that without a surgery I will die before the age of 14 \\*proceeds to laugh\\*", "created_utc": "1622749426.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0h8em7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqog7t", "parent_id": "t1_h0h2i0u", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Hololive", "subreddit_id": "t5_29numb"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Also u/that_one_random_simp\n\n[Here is the clip](https://youtu.be/2NYnT6wVLIc)", "created_utc": "1622746398.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0h1cgn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqog7t", "parent_id": "t1_h0etoj1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Hololive", "subreddit_id": "t5_29numb"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Someone needs to voice act this and post on this sub, this is some top tier copypasta material.", "created_utc": "1622657668.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0cc59d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqj12w", "parent_id": "t1_h0bg87m", "score": "13", "subreddit": "titanfolk", "subreddit_id": "t5_ioe0d"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Well, after it turned out that Ange was [eating once a day and not sleeping for 2 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijisanji/comments/n3a823/ange_free_talk_stream_english_summary_02052021/) I'm kinda in the \"high alert\" mode now.", "created_utc": "1622641539.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0b9oh1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nqgg2b", "parent_id": "t1_h0akioo", "score": "31", "subreddit": "Nijisanji", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ef8gf"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/npp81a/zekken\\_interview\\_leaks/", "created_utc": "1622639970.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0b6jb9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nq98oi", "parent_id": "t1_h0ao6m8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "titanfolk", "subreddit_id": "t5_ioe0d"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Isayama: I just keep moving backwards until my legacy is destroyed.", "created_utc": "1622615121.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0aaln6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nq6moj", "parent_id": "t3_nq6moj", "score": "25", "subreddit": "titanfolk", "subreddit_id": "t5_ioe0d"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "[https://www.aotnorequiem.com/](https://www.aotnorequiem.com/)\n\nIt's not fully done yet, new parts will be released monthly.", "created_utc": "1622489217.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h042s19", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_np0tys", "parent_id": "t1_h041gkj", "score": "6", "subreddit": "titanfolk", "subreddit_id": "t5_ioe0d"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": ">I'm assuming you mean gradient descent on the 3 parameters\n\nCorrect.\n\n>This is because I am not assuming that A, B, and S are fixed, so I want a way of predicting them after every new review.

A day later Coco did the same thing and also mentioned that some of her viewers came from Taiwan. Chinese fans got pissed. There is a lot of history behind the relations between China and Taiwan, but the most important thing to know is that China doesn\u2019t consider Taiwan to be a country but a Chinese state. Haachama and Coco mentioning Taiwan is basically declaring that Taiwan was a country, at least in the eyes of China and its citizens. So China and Chinese fans got really mad at Cover, the parent company of Hololive, and Cover had to do something or else they would lose a big portion of their market. So two days later after  Coco spoke the word \u201cTaiwan\u201d, both Haachama and Coco were suspended for three weeks and Cover made an apology towards China.\n\nBut even after getting suspended, the Chinese fans were still mad at Cover and Hololive. They were especially mad at Coco, as they believed that Haachama accidentally said Taiwan, but that Coco deliberately said Taiwan. So they began plotting to take Coco and Hololive down in revenge for naming a goddamn country. They would become antis (aka haters).\n\nChinese antis began thrashing Coco\u2019s chat, and it became a mess of spammers and fake accounts trying to insult Coco and trolls posing as English fans trying to make Coco look worse. This is still continuing to this day and it even hit other Hololivers Coco has collaborated with. Antis didn't focus on Haachama that much, although she got some hate too.\n\nCover Corp had to make a tough decision: permanently ban two of their vtubers (Coco and Haachama) and continuing bowing down to China, or keeping their two vtubers and getting out of the Chinese market before it is too late.

There's no smart mathematical reason why the average must be set to 100, other than \"it's cool\".\n\n>the highest iq estimated( DaVinci) was around 170\n\nThe *Guiness* world record is held by Marilyn vos Savant, who scored 228 at the age of 10 in 1937. It's a crude extrapolation of results obtained on a scale based on a flawed concept and violates every single rule imaginable concerning IQ and its meaning, and is completely worthless. Estimating the IQ of dead people is also meaningless.\n\nMost modern IQ tests (with the exception of, perhaps, tests used by high IQ societies like Mega Society and Triple Nine Society, but I have no idea what tests they use) are capped at 160. With an average of 100 and standard deviation of 15 (those two numbers are the same for all almost modern tests) an IQ of 160 is roughly one person per 31 500 people. An IQ of 175 would theoretically be around 1 person in 3 500 000 people. Now, when developing an IQ test you need to:\n\n1. Come up with questions of various difficulty\n2. Get a bunch of people, give them your test, then see how the results are distributed, maybe adjust some things, and also calculate smart statistical things to be sure that your test is more useful than a fortune cookie.\n\nIf you want to make a test for ultra-super-mega-giga-geniuses with 160+ IQ, you will need to come up with ultra-super-mega-giga-genius questions, as well as find a whole bunch of exceptionally rare people to beta-test (the proper term is \"norming\", but this is kind of an abridged write up, so it's whatever) your test. Good luck with that. That's why IQ tests are capped at 160 - it's too difficult to make proper questions and then verify that they aren't too easy, aren't too difficult, and are just right and well suited for big brain people.\n\nAlso, there are different tests. For example, Raven's Progressive Matrices only evaluates your non-verbal intelligence by telling you \"sit down and keep putting together abstract pictures for 30 minutes\". It's not bad, but's not very comprehensive either. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale that evaluates both verbal and non-verbal intelligence is the gold standard of IQ tests and is acknowledged by psychiatrists. There are other tests as well and it's kind of a clusterfuck.\n\nAlso please for the love of ~~God~~ Holo don't compare results obtained on different tests. If you and your friends want to know who has a bigger d-- IQ, you should both use the exact same test.\n\nMany people say \"BuT IQ iS UsElEsS\" - it's really not. Sure, it's not perfect, no matter who made the test, but there are plenty of studies that show that if a good test (like Wechsler's) is administered by a professional then the results are pretty meaningful and correlate well with stuff like crime rates, school success, income, job performance, etc.\n\nAnd finally, here is a **rough** scale of what kind of job a person can do at a certain IQ level, and it should **not** be treated like the Holy Bible of IQ.\n\nBelow 70 - intellectual disability, those people have trouble adding 2 and 2 together, literally.\n\n70-80 (borderline intellectually disabled) - janitors, maybe some kind of farm workers or something that involves carrying shit around. Unlikely to benefit from any formal education, have difficulties finishing high school and even elementary school.\n\n80-90 (below average) - auto mechanics, security guards, truck drivers.\n\n90-100 (average and slightly below average) - office clerks, car salesmen, elementary school teachers.\n\n100-110 (average and slightly above average) - managers, accountants, miscellaneous engineers.\n\n110-120 (above average) - have a good chance of finishing college, can become engineers, surgeons, attorneys.\n\n120-130 (gifted) - physicists, chemists, data analysts. People with MDs and PhDs.\n\nAbove 130 (genius) - can do whatever the hell geniuses do these days.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope this was helpful to all two or three people who read it.", "created_utc": "1603142294.0", "edited": "1603144031.0", "id": "g9datrr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_je0u8v", "parent_id": "t1_g9d4z99", "score": "7", "subreddit": "goodanimemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y4au1"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "I'm not even sure if there is a **modern** (tests from the 40's were based on an entirely different concept and the only thing they have in common with modern tests is the name) IQ test with a scale that goes above 160, and even if there is it's unreliable as hell.", "created_utc": "1603135710.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g9cwwbs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_je0u8v", "parent_id": "t1_g9cj7tp", "score": "5", "subreddit": "goodanimemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y4au1"}, {"author": "ClarityInMadness", "body": "Depends on the test.
