The parents of the hosting girl are the \"cool\" parents and prefer the groups to drink at their place than elsewhere. I'm not a weed smoker, and if I cross, then I throw up like a sprinkler. I know this, and stay in my fucking lane. Just beer. Maybe a shot or two. But I'm decent at pacing.  I'm definitely drunk, but I'm never too far gone, yknow?\n\nAnyways, one of the \"weird girls\" is at the party. I know her decently well enough. The losers know each other, because it's all we have. She's not exactly not my type, but she's five years older, and I wanted a friend. I'm not attracted to her, but we support each other through the hellacious shitshow that high school is. She's suddenly really touchy. Super interested in me. I'm not playing into it. Mostly because I don't get it. She's dropping hint after hint about taking it elsewhere, but I'm not biting. Eventually she goes to get us a refill of beer.\n\nI don't know what was in the beer. I wake up, to a queasy rocking and an uncomfortable pressure on my abdomen. I look up to see this person I considered a friend grinding on my dick and riding me like a toy for her amusement. I try to push her away, push her off, but there's no muscle I can put into it. No actual effort I can muster to get her off. I'm slurring every word of no, every dissatisfaction of the happening, and I'm being ignored. She has her idea of what she wants and she's going to get it.\n\nEventually she finishes, I guess. It's a haze. But I passed back out and I wake up with a filled condom on my flaccid penis. I tie a knot in it, throw it away, and I remained the weird kid. Only now I was the weird, gay kid. Because I couldn't even approach the idea of desire and intimacy with a woman until college. I could've bragged about how awesome it was to actually not be a virgin. That I had had sex before, statistically, any of the people bullying me. But it wasn't awesome. The person I had had trust in to help me through ended up making intimacy a huge problem until my first/next girlfriend was persistent enough to break the wall and open the floodgates.\n\nFuck you, Becky. If you had ever been honest with me, I would have been anything for you. You decided to be a rapist instead.\n\nEdit: I was far too sheltered to know what rape was at the time, and I still needed *some* friend group.

Even when these actions are performed knowing the possible outcomes. Children are a risk of sex, and no preventative measure is a 100% effective solution. You know the risks going in, but when the risks come true, suddenly it's not your fault and you shouldn't have to be responsible for your actions anymore. This isn't only putting blame on women, there is a strong need of strong men in the world. Who own up to their actions and acknowledge the responsibility to provide for the mother and child both.\n\nI want a stronger education for young men and women to understand the implications of sex and the repercussions that they can face by choosing to have sex.

Doctors are getting paid worse now than they were in the 80's, but there is a crazy amount more money being pushed into it. Why? Because that money gets lost in all of the management and administration of the hospitals. Not the actual workers. The medicaid system means that a doctor can see you for all of 7 minutes before they lose money.\n\nEducation is bungled, with teachers being left to fend off entitled students and allow graduations and passing grades that frankly should not happen. Partly because of the cultural shifts of entitlement (my poor sister is just recently experiencing a classroom of paparazzi students trying to record her on their phones trying to get her fired for actually teaching her subject) partly the federal standards for education that lessen the actual benchmarks in class.\n\nThen higher learning is experiencing the same problem as health care, where money is somehow pumped in, but with no results other than higher costs. I know less about that field, but I would imagine similar issues occur. I do know that the amount of degrees being churned out have severely lessened the importance of having a degree at all.
