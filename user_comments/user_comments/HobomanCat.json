While my hardback books certainly are expensive (I've spent over $1,000 on the hardbacks lmao), the paperback De Gruyter books are much more reasonable\u2014being ~$20-30.\n\nI bought the hardbacks back in 2018 and 2019, when I was 19-21 years old and had the \"hardback or bust!\" mindset. I've finally been made to realize that as the hardback and paperback versions have the exact same content, why bother shilling out the extra money? Sadly a lot of the books I'd like to eventually get aren't available (hopefully just yet) on paperback.\n\n>  Do you conlang?\n\nYeah conlanging is definitely a big conlanging, and Zompist.com was definitely one of the main resources I used to learn!! I started conlanging pretty much alongside when I started learning linguistics\u2014back around the end of 9th grade/beginning of 10th grade in 2013.\n\nRight now the main conlang I'm working on is called [Uvavava](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JRUWWaJs4Qspxjz54KOWMat5Dvrm1gtB4oV0XYNZs44/edit?usp=sharing) [u\u02c8\u03b2a\u02d0\u03b2\u0259] (I don't really have one dedicated doc for the grammar rn, this is mainly the vocab), and I'm currently translating the [pilot of Futurama](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dR6zXkzreBkYFGaQBCN5WsFveOiMaJylos1g8Zd6lE/edit?usp=sharing) into it\u2014which is proving to be a ton of fun (I've been conlanging on and off every few weeks or so, so progress hasn't been the fastest. Also I don't have IPA for it yet as the phonetics is still maybe in flux, and doing IPA for every sentence takes so fucking long lol)\n\n>  You shouldn't feel like you're missing out on other language families. There are simply too many! \n\nIt's just my main interest in linguistics is (pretty clearly) typology, descriptive linguistics, reference grammars and the like, so I figured it'd be nice to just out of principle have at least one book from each continent/large linguistic area. Idk what/when I'd get a European or African book (Idk why I never gravitated towards African languages why I did those of the Pacific. I guess it's easy to see though why a monolingual English speaker wouldn't be too into European langs though lol.)\n\nAs for the tonology of BCS, Scandinavia etc, yeah they're quite fascinating!!! There's a guy on the linguistics subreddit (sjiveru) who's getting either his masters or PhD in tonology or tonal typology or whatnot, and it's extremely fascinating to see the variation in how tonal languages work and how they're represented with the optimality theory etc! I'm just a lowly guy who's self-taught (and of course learning from others on reddit and discord!) in linguistcs\u2014I tried going to college but I've never been any good at school (I'm sure I'd do well in the linguistics classes but I couldn't seem to get past the GEs)\u2014so all of the theoretical stuff behind tones and whatnot has definitely been going over my head\u2014though I'm definitely keen to learn! I haven't really checked out the Phonological Typology book much yet (I got it on a whim cause it was on sale for like $10 or so on Amazon), but I'm sure it's gonna really challenge my linguistics knowledge like the non-theoretical stuff hasn't!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks so much for your thoughtful reply to my post!\u2014with 8 hours with no comments I was bummed that it'd get lost in /new.

Also some Serbo-Croation varieties are now tonal (many phonologists are now saying that \"pitch accent\" isn't a meaningful grouping, and they should just be considered tonal languages), and also a bunch of Dardic varieties.\n\nIn Africa I've heard of Afrikaans currently undergoing tonogenesis, but I haven't read up on it (or have and have forgotten it by now).\n\nMost Mon-Khmer languages aren't tonal, but influence from Chinese has led to the loss in certain phonations in Vietnamese and some other languages, and the gaining of tones. Also several Austronesian languages have independently developed tones, some without any other tonal languages spoken nearby.\n\n[Here's an article](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-02519305/file/Michaud_Sands_2020_Tonogenesis.pdf) (that I haven't read yet) giving examples of tonogenesis in various families. \n\nThere's so many different languages and families out there, and considering roughly half of the languages on this planet are tonal, idk why you'd assume it hasn't happened more times then what you've specifically learned about and remembered.", "created_utc": "1654038543.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iapyc46", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1rrkf", "parent_id": "t1_iapnatk", "score": "24", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "I mean I've heard people on I think this sub (could be others) say that they lived too far away for the buses to get them, so idk.", "created_utc": "1654032541.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iaplciv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1v48u", "parent_id": "t1_iapkj5x", "score": "1", "subreddit": "fuckcars", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cs2l"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "There's still Korean varieties that never lost their tonality.", "created_utc": "1654031812.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iapjpbv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1rrkf", "parent_id": "t1_iapghr8", "score": "8", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "What could possibly make you claim that tonogenesis has only happened 5 times in history lmao.", "created_utc": "1654031662.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iapjdc9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1rrkf", "parent_id": "t1_iaohofz", "score": "18", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "It's already been a tonal language, for varities like Busan Korean.", "created_utc": "1654031497.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iapizzl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1rrkf", "parent_id": "t1_iaodqmo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguisticshumor", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vwiq"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "I guess if they live far away enough in a rural area the buses won't reach them.", "created_utc": "1654028606.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iapccj9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1v48u", "parent_id": "t1_iapbppq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "fuckcars", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cs2l"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "Yeah we only had one car from my birth to age 16, then we sold it and moved across the country in the only other car we had during my childhood\u2014so no hand-me-downs for me or my siblings lol.", "created_utc": "1654026868.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iap894j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v1v48u", "parent_id": "t1_iap7hrw", "score": "6", "subreddit": "fuckcars", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cs2l"}, {"author": "HobomanCat", "body": "Is it really every vocalist you've heard?

Normally the quatative would just mean \"It was said: What all did he buy in town\", but using again the falling interrogative intonation (with the penultimate syllable likely being mid-falling and the final low or low-falling) means that you're inquiring into what was said, rather than stating what was said. For just quoting what was being said, the sentence would end in a rising intonation on the final syllables, as the language uses rising intonations for declarative sentences and falling for interrogative.

Galneryus was the first band I ever got into (with Phoenix Rising being the first album I ever listened to from any genre), so of course they're gonna hold a special place in my heart. I love how consistent they are, with a great album every year or two, and songs being decent at worst. There's so many bombastic choruses, and every song has such fantastic guitar and keyboard solos\u2014I really love how Yuhki has basically an equal presence in the songs (though there def could be more bass solos/louder bass work)! I really like how they've evolved their sound over the years, becoming more and more progressive with their last few albums. I really hope their next album could strike the perfect blend of progginess and heaviness while still being melodic and catchy.\n\nRhapsody just has the perfect power metal feel to me, and I love how bombastic all their choruses are. While their career has been much more tumultuous than Galneryus', they just have such good energy and spirit. Also I love the concept and sincerity behind all their albums.\n\nAlbum: **Kamelot - Epica**. While I wouldn't necessarily say this album has any of my favorite songs, as a whole it is just so cohesive, and I love how all the songs flow into the next and call back to each other. This one is definitely best listened to in one go I think.\n\nSong: **Stratovarius- Elysium**. 18 minutes of pure musical brilliance, what more is there to say? Extremely cohesive for how long it is. It doesn't feel like a bunch of different sections (like some other long songs), rather one flowing unit\u2014with the choruses and melodies all connected.
