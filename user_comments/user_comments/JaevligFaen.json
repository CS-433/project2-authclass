I think without a solid history of reading/listening to a language, you're forced to make a lot of assumptions on how things are said, which are very often wrong. I have an example from my own experience: I didn't know how to say \"make sure\" so I made a quick assumption and directly translated the words \"be sure\" into the language I was speaking. Even though I changed the phrase into a form I assumed would make sense, the person I was speaking with still didn't understand what I meant, because basically it was wrong.\n\nThen there is the issue of comprehension, which I'd argue is the most important aspect of all. You can't have a conversation if you can't understand the person you're speaking with. You might be able to convey a message using only words you know, but the response will contain whatever collection of words the speaker wants to use regardless of which words you're familiar with.\n\nSo for these reasons, and due to the nature of my own goals, I focus exclusively on input. My only goal in regards to output is being able to speak well enough that people don't immediately switch to English for me.", "created_utc": "1666712474.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itqgwrb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yd3qhv", "parent_id": "t3_yd3qhv", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "JaevligFaen", "body": "This is the current set of stages that I've noticed seem right after years of learning the wrong way. I'm still trying it out myself though, so it's just ideas so far. Also this is with European languages in mind. It will absolutely be a more complicated process for languages with alternative writing systems or very different grammar.\n\nFundamentals: The stuff you learn from textbooks or apps, first 1000 common words, some basic grammar. (Optionally, you could try some ambient listening without worrying about understanding any of it, just to get a feel for how the language sounds)\n\nReading: (The longest stage) If you're learning a popular language you'll be able to find graded readers and gradually scale up to novels. If you're learning a less popular language you might have to start with novels and just slowly work through them. Put new words or phrases in anki (or any SRS) until you get pretty comfortable reading, then scale down your use of SRS and just read for enjoyment. The reason I put this before listening is because I think not having to worry about the accent or speed simplifies the process.\n\nListening: Podcasts, TV, movies, etc. I prefer to know a lot of vocabulary before worrying about this because gaps in vocabulary knowledge while listening can make it feel like the accent is too hard (or people speak too fast) when really you just need to know more words and phrases. \n\nOutput: Writing/speaking. If you want to be more eloquent in your target language, it makes sense to practice a lot of writing and speaking at this point. I don't stress about it personally, my goals are much more targeted towards comprehension.\n\n> But what about speaking early?\n\nAt least for me, speaking early doesn't make sense at all. Like trying to learn how to draw without looking at any references. In training, our brains require examples to reference later. Whenever I've tried speaking a language before reading enough, I always end up directly translating phrases like \"make sure\" which won't make sense.
