If you don't, they're going to sneak up on you, and you won't like the ending.\n\nDo you want to leave? Maybe you'd prefer to stay in the congregation, even though you don't accept the teachings as true. Honestly, that would be understandable in many ways. But, to do so, you have to decide (ahead of time) that your going to wear a face. You won't talk about your doubts. You won't talk about serious mistakes you make. You will project an image.\n\nAlternatively, what if you want to leave, but you don't want to lose your friends and family completely? Well, then it's key that you don't  talk to the elders about your doubts, and that you never give them reason/opportunity to disfellowship you. \"Spiritually strong\" witnesses should know to avoid anyone who's not following the rules, but remember: inactive is subjective, disfellowshipped is not. Get labeled inactive, and you'll still lose a lot of what you have. But contact with your friends and family will still be possible. Get disfellowshipped, and they will feel spiritually obligated to cut you off.\n\nOf course, you have to decide what's best for you. But if you've come this far, you know that you don't believe what's being taught. So decide what you want, and act accordingly.

You just don't form strong connections with words unless you're using them directly. Now,  of course,  you're looking at two languages that are not spoken.  So I'll make the following recommendation.  \n\nArabic. It's incredibly hard,  and not typically a good beginner's language. However,  it's the only one on this list where you'll get the joy of meeting new people,  consuming new (modern) media, and traveling to new countries.  It would be useful for learning the immersion/speaking technique(which I really advocate strongly for). However,  keep in mind that the Arabic of the Quran is basically another language,  and will take loads of extra work after loads of work to learn the spoken form. \n\nLatin. Buy far the easiest for an English speaker.  Just remember,  \"easy\" is relative. You've never learned a language,  so this will be a very difficult process. I strongly recommend joining an immersion-style Latin program(again,  nothing beats speaking a language).\n\n\nBiblical Hebrew. I'm guessing you didn't mean modern Hebrew,  even though they are similar.  This would be the hardest one of all,  given that it is not spoken, is significantly more distant from English than Latin (or Koine Greek, for that matter), and the least popular of the Biblical languages.  It's not going to be hard to find resources,  but it will be very hard to ever use it in conversation(obviously,  you don't need to for reading ancient texts. However,  again,  speaking meaningfully - even in a dead language - will form direct connections far quicker than memorizing translations from a dictionary) . I recommend The Polis Institute.

But why does 2i have four digits?\n\nI'm also still confused about how this works,  and why it's better for arithmetic.  i = the square root of negative one(correct? ). So 2i = 2 times the square root of negative one. Negative one cannot have a real square root, but the square root should be \"-1\" and \"1\"(If I remember my high school math lol). So (2 x 1 = 2), or (2 x -1 = -2).

About 30% more get it from the government. In other words, most people don't pay for their own medical expenses - insurance does.  That's not to say co-pays don't suck. But when people don't pay for something,  they overuse it.  When they overuse,  co-pays go up. \n\nThat was reason one. Next up, let's look at policies that raise costs. Firstly, insurance can't deny coverage. So a healthy 20 year old is grouped with an obese 60 year old. Sounds nice, but it makes coverage ridiculously expensive for the healthy.\n\nAdded to that, you can't shop insurance outside of your state. And the number of doctors graduating is regulated(creating a permanent shortage). Not to mention, restrictions on treatment by nurse practictioners, and other small policies, make things more expensive.\n\nIn industries where capitalism is left alone, desirable products become more affordable with time.
