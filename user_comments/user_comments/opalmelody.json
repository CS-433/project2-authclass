[{"author": "opalmelody", "body": "Thank you for sharing your experience and opening up this conversation. Disabled voices need to be heard more on this topic. I was also born with birth defects, specifically several heart defects that together form a type of complex congenital heart disease.

That said, I'm playing life on hard(er) mode and I can't imagine having my own child go through what I have. \n\nNancy given her profession should be well aware of the structural violence that disabled people in the U.S. face. We deal with education and employment discrimination, lack of access, social exclusion, poverty, sky-high medical bills. Caretakers of disabled people lack a social safety net. I don't think the topic of abortion and disability can be discussed without acknowledgment of systemic ableism. The decision of whether to abort does not occur in a vacuum. In our current society it is so expensive to care for a child, let alone a child that may need surgeries, therapies, continued care. \n\nI hope society will progress to a point where disabled people are not forced into poverty, and we will have equal rights and opportunities.", "created_utc": "1666851668.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ityi58h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yeg4l5", "parent_id": "t3_yeg4l5", "score": "53", "subreddit": "LoveIsBlindOnNetflix", "subreddit_id": "t5_2e7kr5"}, {"author": "opalmelody", "body": "I was once a disabled fetus, and am now a person with heart defects.

Three Arab music ensembles later and I'm still trying to figure it out. My observations:\n\n- Ornamentations are everywhere; you should not play a piece straight from the sheet music without adding ornamentations or else it won't have the same sound. The ornamentations tend to happen really quickly and it takes practice to reach that speed.\n- Improvisation is important and encouraged. If you watch Arabic music performances, there are often \"taqsim\" sections where a solo musician will play an improvisation while the other musicians play a drone or quiet accompaniment. This mindset of improvisation is key to this type of music. You're not strictly following notes on a page.\n\nThese are my suggestions (bear in mind I'm learning):\n\n1) Immerse yourself in Arabic music until it comes out of your pores. Can't stress the importance of this. Listen to Umm Kulthum, Abdel Halim Hafez, instrumental music, orchestras, takht ensembles. Listen to the music at less than full speed to hear the ornamentations better, and try to copy. A few videos I have found helpful:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9uD6x-Q983g\nhttps://youtu.be/YheMatvtJX0\nhttps://youtu.be/YheMatvtJX0\nhttps://youtu.be/9ONG2cwu1b4\nhttps://youtu.be/-wlS5eWto18 \n\n2) Read about maqam theory. Arabic music has a whole complex system of musical modes, which include microtones. \n\n3) Get a teacher if possible. I started taking Arabic violin lessons this year and it has made a big difference in terms of understanding what's going on in the music, how I should sound, what ornamentation to add. I spend a good chunk of the lesson being mind-boggled at the sounds my teacher can create from the violin lol. \n\n4) Practice the glissandos with a metronome building up the speed. Same for other ornamentation -- start slow and work on speed. The ornamentations I'm learning require a speed I hadn't used when I was studying classical. It helps to do small finger movements close to the fingerboard instead of lifting your fingers too much.", "created_utc": "1589319259.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fqf5xuo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gicoee", "parent_id": "t3_gicoee", "score": "5", "subreddit": "violinist", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sbn3"}, {"author": "opalmelody", "body": "It kind of looks like gelato!

Arabic was one of my majors and I did not become fluent in it because I didn't put in extra work outside of what was required for classes. I reached a good understanding of fusha/classical grammar and Egyptian dialect, but I didn't actively work to expand my vocabulary beyond what was presented in Al-Kitaab (3rd ed) or my Egyptian textbook. So I was not able to express myself comfortably on any topic without fumbling for vocab, and I would not have been able to read a novel without stopping to look up a lot of words. Also, the fusha program was three years, not four, and completing the whole three years wasn't required to graduate with the major.\n\nIf I could do things over again, I would have devoted much more outside study to Arabic, reading and listening to content beyond what the classes presented, practicing with my teachers, and actively looking up words I didn't know. \n\nI will also say that if I had only stuck with the standard Arabic language classes, I would not have gained the grammar knowledge I ended up with, because my school's fusha program did not focus much on grammar and Al-Kitaab 3rd ed didn't go into much detail. I took classical Arabic and linguistic analysis of Arabic classes, and those provided the grammatical foundation that I rely on now as I'm picking Arabic back up. \n\nMy school's standard Arabic classes at the time also didn't really include dialects, so I supplemented it with Egyptian dialect classes.

For more context about myself, I'm in my 20s and have been out as ace (our community shorthand for asexual) since my teens. I've dated various people and am currently in a serious relationship with a non-ace.\n\nI think that your gf coming out to you means that she really trusts you and wants you to know about this aspect of her. It's a really vulnerable position to be in because you're sharing something extremely personal and you're afraid the other person will judge you or not care about you anymore. Even though some progress has been made in terms of asexual awareness, asexuality is not viewed positively and your gf knows she is opening herself up to potential judgment. So firstly I hope you will acknowledge to her that you are very thankful and honored that she chose to share this with you.\n\nSecond, for the question of whether to try to make the relationship work, I have a few questions for you to think about:\n\n1) Prior to your gf coming out to you, were you guys having any sex- or intimacy-related issues? If so, were they causing any problems for your relationship? (If you weren't having such issues, that's a good sign.)\n\n2) As your gf is sex-repulsed, are you fine with not having sex potentially ever in the relationship?\n\n3) What are your love languages and are they met in your relationship? Do you feel loved by your gf even though/if you can't have sex with her? \n\n4) Are you willing to learn more about asexuality and be an ally to your gf and to the asexual community? \n\nContrary to what others may think, I don't think that asexuality itself necessarily poses a problem for a relationship. Someone being asexual doesn't tell you if they're sex-favorable, indifferent, or repulsed, just like merely knowing that someone is straight doesn't tell you how big of a sex drive they have. Aces can have also sex drives, have sex, etc., but everyone is different, and how much each person in the relationship wants/likes sex determines the compatibility. \n\nIn your case, as your gf is sex-repulsed and you have a low sex drive, that sounds like a pairing that could work, but it requires both of you to assess what you want in the relationship and what you are okay giving up or compromising on.
