If a city has allocated, say, 15 feet *of roadway* to having a bike lane and a parking lane, then that's space for a 7' buffered bike lane and an 8' parking lane, or a 5' protected bike lane, 2' shy zone, and 8' parking lane. So far the tradeoff seems pretty neutral; that shy zone is sort of implied in the buffered bike lane's buffer space.\n\nHowever, where I live, there's a couple of things that go into the city choosing one versus the other:\n\n* what kind of street is this? a low- to medium-traffic residential street has drivers who are constantly parking on the same street and will learn the peculiarities of the particular setup, there's fewer parking actions in a given day in a given spot, and a blocked bike lane is lower risk since there's less likely to be traffic to block a merging cyclist.\n\n* how many curb cuts are there? you need to have a clear zone, generally 20' here, before and after each curb for visibility, so that turning drivers don't turn into someone riding in the bike lane. We have residential streets where there's 20' between each curb cut, so if you installed a parking-protected bike lane, there'd just be a painted hashed area, or giant concrete blob, between those houses.\n\nIn addition, my city is also fairly new to the protected bike lane game, so they're still working out the kinks in exactly how they design them.\n\nBasically, if you have a high amount of churn on a commericial corridor with few driveways -- delivery drivers doing pickup and delivery, people stopping by at a local business ot pick things up, few curbcuts that would cut down on street parking -- it's a lot easier to build a protected bike lane that keeps bikes and parking/standing cars out of conflict.\n\nMy understanding is that they've talked about sidewalk-level bike lanes being able to solve some of the curbcut visibility problem, since they'd be set up and back from the parked cars.

On a regional level, that's Link21, which is being done in coordination with a bunch of regional agencies but spearheaded by BART:\n\nhttps://link21program.org/en \n\nAnd on a city level, they're doing their own planning that's leaning towards a line that heads down Geary, then down 19th Ave to Daly City.\n\nBoth of those are very early days.\n\nBut right now, I don't think we can expect to see traditional BART itself extend much further than the line in SF, and maybe some lines in inner, urban parts of the Bay. Instead, we're likely to see something more akin to a European-style regional service, with frequent trains on existing corridors and less grade separation.\n\nThe Link21 plan is very explicitly focusing on two things: greenhouse gas reduction and equity. Marin has a wealthy population of 260k spread across a very large area; since building rail access to it from San Francisco will be *incredibly* expensive, I expect them to pass on the idea.\n\nWhat's much more likely is two things:\n\n* SMART to Fairfield: this is something that's called out in our State Rail Plan, and initial feasibility studies are already underway. Right now the most likely option being studied would take the existing rail corridor that connects to the SMART track south of Novato, runs up to Schellville, over to Napa Junction, and across to Cordelia. I'm suspicious of this project's viability from a ridership standpoint, but that seemingly didn't stop SMART in the first place.\n\n* ...the other option would be that with a future SR-37 climate adaptation (the existing roadway will be flooded with a few feet of sea level rise, so it needs to be entirely rebuilt), a rail corridor will be built parallel to the roadway, avoiding the circuitous path from Marin to Solano County I laid out above.\n\n* Rail across a replacement Richmond Bridge: Assemblymember Marc Levine is laying the groundwork for a replacement of the 580 bridge since it's literally crumbling. One of the ideas he explicitly calls out is running rail across the bridge; in my personal imagination I see SMART connecting to BART at either Richmond or Del Norte, but there's not even an agency with studying this on their roadmap, so it'll be a while. https://a10.asmdc.org/richmond-bridge-repair-rethink-rebuild-1 \n\nIn all, I think it's likely that at least one of these projects makes it pretty far along; I'd guess the most likely scenario is Link21 decides it's infeasible to build anything good, but the slow SMART connection to Fairfield is built anyways as a mitigation for expanding roadway capacity with an SR-37 rebuild.\n\nDefinitely no BART, though in my ideal world the 580 bridge rebuild would actually bring BART west across the Bay instead of SMART east across the Bay, since then SMART would be able to continue running all trains to Larkspur and a BART/SMART/bus transfer at San Rafael would be pretty powerful.

Are they the owner of the unit, or do they pay rent to a landlord? What documents did you sign, if any, with them?\n\nThere are two ways people can take other people's spots in a unit:\n\n* becoming a subtenant: you have an agreement with the person who's renting the space that you will then rent a part of that space *from them*\n\n* replacing a tenant: you have an agreement with the landlord and the old tenant to take over their liabilities on the original lease\n\nIf you were a month-to-month subtenant, you cannot be required to give them more than 30 days notice that you are leaving, but they *can* require you to pay rent through that full 30 days even if you moved out earlier than that. If this is your situation, you are owed a list of receipts for exactly what they are keeping the deposit for within 21 calendar days by mail, or if mutually agreed upon, email. Actual receipts from professional contractors, or for supplies and a reasonable hourly wage.\n\nIf you *replaced a tenant* on the main lease, you are bound to the terms of that lease. So for instance, if they signed a year lease with the original landlord, and then you replaced someone six months into it and signed on to *replace them on that lease*, you are liable for the remaining six months, even if you leave early.\n\nIf you replaced a tenant on the main lease, and the main lease is a month-to-month lease, my understanding is that under San Francisco's rent control ordinance, you *may still liable* even if you attempt to leave unless *all tenants* terminate the contract -- this is the situation I found myself in recently. From my conversations with the San Francisco Tenant's Union, it sounded like the kind of thing that would have to be decided in court.\n\nThere are two groups in San Francisco that work to make sure that low-income tenants are treated lawfully that may be worth reaching out to for more direct advice. They do not generally offer free legal advice, but they offer counseling by professionals in the field. Please consider reaching out to:\n\n* Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco\n\n* San Francisco Tenant's Union\n\nwith the information I outlined in my first questions, as well as a summary of your issue.", "created_utc": "1649286482.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3oxubi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txunsb", "parent_id": "t3_txunsb", "score": "6", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz"}, {"author": "lojic", "body": "Alum Rock Park is a classic, ruins of the old natatorium / baths and some mineral springs up in the back of the canyon.", "created_utc": "1649280399.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3ojbpg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_txt9kz", "parent_id": "t3_txt9kz", "score": "3", "subreddit": "SanJose", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rbod"}, {"author": "lojic", "body": "https://www.sbsun.com/2022/04/01/first-new-arrow-train-hits-tracks-between-redlands-san-bernardino/\n\nThey're running diesel right now, and have some hydrogen trains on order from Stadler as well.", "created_utc": "1649183236.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3iswk3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_twwgxm", "parent_id": "t1_i3iehqv", "score": "14", "subreddit": "transit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qha9"}, {"author": "lojic", "body": "two way protected bike lanes are tough to get right, the intersections are going to kill the design (or cyclists).

They should be starting construction this year, if I'm recalling the board presentations I referenced when making this map, but it will definitely take through next year to open.\n\n* [Ferry 2 Bridge 2 Greenway](https://ferry2bridge2greenway.com/): this is a \"quick-build\" project that's currently under construction (sections are already done). If you're familiar with quick-build style projects elsewhere, this is a bit better -- in Richmond, they include plastic \"armadillos\" in the protected lane that provide more incentive for drivers to not just drive over the posts.\n    * completion of this will mean that the only gap in trail that isn't under construction from San Rafael to Yerba Buena Island is a few blocks of Shellmound in Emeryville (and two low-traffic blocks through Point Richmond)! I'll still take Regatta though :)\n\n* Richmond Wellness Trail: from BART to either MLK Park/**Cutting** ~~or south of 580 to Wright Ave, I had a hard time interpreting the documents out there about this~~. The northern segment is traffic calming with traffic circles, diverters, and bulbouts; south of the Richmond Greenway it's a two-way curb-protected cycletrack.\n\n* Pennsylvania Ave / 13th Ave / Rumrill: the cities of Richmond and San Pablo coordinated a road redesign project that'll allow safe bike travel from the Iron Triangle all the way north to San Pablo Ave. San Pablo's sections are under construction this year, and Richmond will be starting theirs in 2023 or 2024 with completion in 2024 or 2025. These are high-quality, landscaping protected lanes in major segments: https://www.sanpabloca.gov/2590/Rumrill-Boulevard-Complete-Streets-Proje\n\nand my favorite is the [Yellow Brick Road initiative](https://pogopark.org/what-we-do/yellow-brick-road/) in the Iron Triangle, which grew out of teenagers wanting safer places to get around in their neighborhood. It's a combination of traffic calming, routefinding, urban greening.

A quick stop at the Dirt World Bike Skills Park is a hell of a lot of fun before the confusing mess of a route under the tracks on 23rd where the trail has an interruption (just study it on Google Maps before you go haha). From there the trail is a bit dirty and gross but just keep with it til you get to the Ohlone Greenway.

The entire point of this quick diversion is to avoid San Pablo Dam Rd as much as possible because it's garbage, so try to parallel it on Canyon Rd as far east as you can before you're forced onto SPD Rd.

You're in redwoods, it's super low traffic, and the bizarre tiny town of Canyon peeks through the trees at you. The Lafayette Moraga Trail is super chill and beautiful. Ice cream at Loard's!\n\n#### Why it sucks\n\nMoraga under CA-13 really is awful.

There are three choices:\n\n1. Ride across the Antioch Bridge. From Antioch BART to the Rio Vista, it's around 15 miles, but the Antioch Bridge has a thin bike lane / shoulder, very fast traffic, and debris in the lane: https://twitter.com/dotLocutus/status/1391104034019241986\n\n2. Ride from the Capitol Corridor from Suisun-Fairfield station to Rio Vista -- it's around 22mi. The route is either mostly along CA-12, which is pretty freshly paved, has pretty decent shoulders except around one curve, I think. I've been researching this but haven't ridden it yet after my experience with the Antioch Bridge.\n\n3. Ride from the Capitol Corridor from Fairfield-Vacaville station to Rio Vista -- around 26mi. This route involves going along the north side of Travis AFB and then down CA-113. Probably the most comfortable of routes, lots of standard country riding through fields.\n\nOnce you're in Rio Vista, your life gets a lot easier. There's no one route that hits all the places to check out, but here's one option: [google maps link](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Rio+Vista,+CA+94571/38.1242646,-121.677981/Ishkeesh+Marine+Services,+West+Brannan+Island+Road,+Isleton,+CA/Isleton,+CA/38.1844853,-121.5648764/Locke+Boarding+House+Museum,+Main+Street,+Walnut+Grove,+CA/38.2365496,-121.6022985/38.3483103,-121.5771865/38.4444551,-121.5689573/Sacramento+Valley+Station,+Public+Parking+Lot,+I+St,+Sacramento,+CA/@38.397408,-121.534169,11z/data=!4m37!4m36!1m5!1m1!1s0x808537ace8c753f3:0x69fa7cc5f0a9f9a9!2m2!1d-121.6913439!2d38.1557502!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x809aabc46bd8907b:0xf816317f916dcde9!2m2!1d-121.5685016!2d38.097967!1m5!1m1!1s0x809aad4c5d170eeb:0xa8496ce7c16334fc!2m2!1d-121.6116206!2d38.1618614!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x809ab11394e57ecb:0xe8c2191154e63e0f!2m2!1d-121.5100154!2d38.2512867!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x809ad6d2903da319:0x62a4df308f9fb14b!2m2!1d-121.5007671!2d38.5840898!3e1) / [screenshot](https://ibb.co/RQzjxLJ)\n\nEssentially, avoid riding on CA-160 and River Rd as much as possible.

His route for the day should involve Pleasants Valley Road and a stop in **Winters** if it's the good one :)\n\nThere is a bit of hill but it's not too bad, like 1200ft total elevation gain over the entire route from Vallejo to Davis. The roads in Vallejo aren't top-class for cycliing, but they're fine enough. It gets pretty much instantly better as soon as you catch the bike path at the northern end of the city, I really like it up there.\n\nIn Winters, there's a local sandwich shop all the cyclists in the know stop at for sandwiches, **Steady Eddy's**. Closes at 3pm, according to Google. It's around 45mi from the ferry, and most people his age tend to be early risers, so he probably has a good chance of making it depending on his speed.\n\nHow far is he planning on riding per day?

Good tea selection as well.\n* **Temple Coffee Roasters**: several locations in Sacramento, one in Davis. If I'm in Sacramento, I'll go to the one on S St, since it's right around the corner from Puskin's Bakery!\n\nThe section of the route up to Folsom is also great -- there's a bike trail the entire way from Sacramento to Folsom and it's very pleasant, and if it's not a weekend probably not too busy.

Don't expect a hill. I think there's a place where the road dips under a former railroad, that's the hilliest hill.\n* the Old Sugar Mill is a gorgeous old sugar mill turned Delta wine center. A lot of the place is outdoors in the back, if you're worried about COVID. Free entry, not sure if they let bikes inside, but it's a really beautiful old building. Probably a moot point if you're on a tight schedule. Bonus: there's an outdoor cat that likes pets. \n* There are some food options in Clarksburg. Never tried any of em, and if you want to rely on them I might suggest bringing cash, the delta is that kind of place.\n* Pumphouse Road is partially gravel, less than 2mi, though. It's one of the most gorgeous parts of the route in my opinion.\n* River Rd from Freeport to Clarksburg is going to be the busiest section of the ride. I've done it before on a bike and people give you space in my experience.\n* I have no idea what that section through Sac is like, I've only done it on the west side of the river, so YMMV.

The 5 Fulton on the edge of Golden Gate Park runs every 9min.\n\nIt's definitely an entirely different feeling from Goose Hollow. I'll echo what others have said about the roads: they're oddly tree-free. That's the case most places in San Francisco. \n\nIt's a much more contiguous \"urban\" area than Sellwood or Goose Hollow. Clement St has most of a mile of food and local shopping options, and a block up California has some great options too. The retail/restaurant strips feel a lot like Belmont St but a few times longer and denser, though significantly more food- and less bar-/evening-based.\n\nI can't speak to parking, since I don't have a car. I can say: keep at least the one car. There's so much to the Bay Area and not having one... I make my friends go on a lot of adventures.\n\nIn terms of restaurants, I really like Lime Tree, but my friends are generally not the most enthused by it, so that might be a personal thing :) I've not lived in the Richmond, only the Inner Sunset, but I've had a friend swear by Pho Huynh Sang. Ariscault on the corner of Arguello is locally/not-just-locally famous. \n\nI actually just moved out of SF. I'm in the East Bay now. This might make a good \"why is it good, why is it bad\":\n\nWhat I don't like about SF:\n\n* trees. I mentioned this before, I'll mention it again, SF just has NO street trees for some reason. It's sad.\n* without a car, you're far from the rest of the Bay Area. With a car, somewhat less so, but you're still off the freeway network. Unless you're going to Marin County, you're not close to it, if it is outside SF.\n* the people. San Francisco has a bunch of different crowds, and the groups I tended to interact with tended to be more of the just-out-of-college looking for a career type. Boring. That was definitely a me problem, but my East Bay friends are less that so that's nice. I find it easier to find \"community\" here.\n* Public transit: god it's slow. Around 8mph. The light rail somehow isn't much better, it's like 9mph. HOW?\n* Biking: less space is dedicated to bikes than in Portland or the East Bay. Cars are more aggressive than Portland.\n\nWhat I really like about SF:\n\n* it's a gorgeous natural environment. Redwood forests are like the douglas fir forests of the Bay Area, but they can grow to be way crazier in scale. Golden Gate Park is made from former sand dunes, but is just wonderful -- paddle boats on the little artificial lake, chilling on some grass, feeding geese, bike rides, walks.\n* way more food per block, and it's good food, too. \n* the city and its people want to improve. People just disagree on what means. Compare that to Ted Wheeler, who doesn't seem to want to do much at all.\n* Competent leadership at the municipal and state level, for the most part.
