They know what case is, what gender is, they know the names of the cases, and they've probably memorized the endings for each gender and case.\n\nLuckily knowing things like \"this is the masculine definite article in the accusative case\" is not what makes someone good at actually speaking German fluently. Most German speakers don't think about this at all, they just do what *feels* right and you can build that *feeling* up too. Unless you need to be able to do this for a grade or something I wouldn't sweat your explicit grammar knowledge much so long as you feel like you're making progress in your ability to communicate and understand \u2014 and that your \"Bauchgef\u00fchl\" for when to use which case (and gender) is also getting more accurate.\n\nAs an encouraging example, I learned case pretty much entirely by feel and not by memorization or coursework: I didn't do any formal studying to learn case and the article endings beyond  reading enough about how case works  to know 1) that case exists, 2) that it acts on nouns and 3)  how, roughly, case impacts meaning, and then just consuming loads of input. With time (about 2 years self-study to b2 ) I developed a pretty good instinct for what article to use when. \n\nAnd yeah it's super super hard, but try not to fall back on English in public haha. My teacher schimpfed me super hard for speaking English with the other students (all non-native speakers who wanted to practice with me between class sessions) and was pretty clear with me and everyone else that using English as a crutch will get in the way of learning German. Staying in international bubbles is kind of a death sentence for language progress as an English speaker... at this point whenever I do go to international meetups I always very specifically try to stick to the German-speaking bubbles until basically forced at social gunpoint to speak English lol", "created_utc": "1666426534.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itb5d67", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y90clc", "parent_id": "t1_itaxanb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "emcuttsy", "body": "I still believe pretty firmly that with enough input it is possible to learn a language, that's a point we're just not going to agree on XD But I still want to engage with this because you raise some interesting points and this is helping me crystalize some of my own ideas.\n\nFirst, fair. \"do this do that\" is obviously not as good as people learning to find their own method... but when someone asks for advice being told \"find your own method and strike a balance\" isn't super helpful. Giving some explicit suggestions, especially on a site like reddit where everyone will chime in with a different opinion, gives people a buffet of possibilities to try out themselves to build that individual method ;) \n\nWith that out of the way: I DEFINITELY agree that people often fail at learning via input. They do. I just don't think this is evidence that input alone doesn't work. I think it is evidence that it's possible to do input wrong \u2014 of course just watching TV shows for adults and doing nothing else is probably not an effective learning strategy because the input isn't comprehensible if you can't understand it well.\n\nAs an adult, it is admittedly really hard to get the right kind of input as a beginner. As a kid adults just sit around feeding you level-appropriate input all day whether you like it or not. For input to work, you need to understand it pretty well. The average adult will realistically only get this kind of input from some kind of resource for beginners.\n\n\\> What exactly do you mean by studying/explicit learning, then? Because I'd argue learning about cases is studying, and in your first comment, you said that the idea that it's helpful at all is debatable. \n\nRe \"debatable,\" from all I've read, this is just how it is: the point is under active debate in the second language acquisition research community. Meanwhile, \"input is necessary\" is not. Again, this is as best I understand. I'm not in this field but I am trying to read the academic literature when I have time.\n\nRe: \"explicit vs implicit learning,\" this is a borderline point, I agree. I think the difference I see here is a matter of the role of the knowledge. I don't think it's effective to memorize forms and then expect that you can use them \u2014 but I do believe that you only acquire the ability to use forms when you understand sentences within which they appear. Knowing case exists means you'll know to pay attention to how nouns change when you are trying to understand sentences, which can improve comprehensibility and therefore acquisition. Just memorizing the endings won't \u2014 unless you focus on the meaning of those endings, too. This is the classic \"focus on form\" vs \"focus on meaning\" debate and I think \"focus on meaning\" is what matters, even if you're doing that focus through explicit discussion of grammar. \n\nSeems like a gray zone to me that researchers would have trouble designing an experiment to separate out  \u2014 does reading a bunch of sentences in a grammar textbookcount as input or studying? So long as you understand the sentences (which you probably do, thanks to the textbook), it's input. But it's also aimed at teaching you something explicit... tricky stuff. \n\nTDLR with the right kind of input, I think people could acquire case (like kids do). But getting that kind of input as an adult is hard and if people hit their head over incomprehensible input they won't get anywhere. Building grammar awareness (as opposed to grammar form memorization) is a gray zone.", "created_utc": "1666380544.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it8rgo7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y9tl6y", "parent_id": "t1_it8jfww", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "emcuttsy", "body": "I obviously disagree, but thanks for your comment. Personally, I would buy that being \"aware\" of grammar can be helpful \u2014 i.e., knowing case exists and knowing how it changes meaning. That's what I did I was learning German (but didn't study/drill case endings). Still... I obviously don't think memorizing case ending charts helps anyone as much as just reading a bunch of books would.\n\nHere's where I'm coming from: my personal experience with learning German went fine despite never doing formal grammar study until I took at course at C1 level just to meet people once I moved to Austria. English and German are closely related, though, so that certainly makes this method easier. So I base my opinion here also on 0) Steven Krashen's studies and writings, 1) Beniko Mason's studies of Japanese learners of English (two unrelated languages), 2) research including this recent review: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/flan.12552](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/flan.12552) and 3) the stories of people I know in the language community who learned distantly related/not related languages using input.  \nObviously there's a reason this is still controversial. I think I've seen more fights over this on language twitter than over any other topic, and that's probably not changing any time soon.", "created_utc": "1666376727.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it8i0ym", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y9tl6y", "parent_id": "t1_it8gqbc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "emcuttsy", "body": "Servus \u2014 are you also learning Austrian German?\n\nSo... the \"bad\" news is that English is in the same language family as German and being a native English speaker comes with some serious advantages when you're learning German \u2014 though the advantage is mostly with vocabulary recognition thanks to the cognates and less with the grammar.\n\nBut!!!! Remember that you have NO idea what your classmates' history is and how hard they're working. Do you know how many years of school they had learning German? Do you know how much they study at home? Do you know how much experience they've had learning languages in general? As a British person I'm guessing they have more experience than you, just because they probably learned English as well as German. \n\nThere are some grammar features that do exist in the Balkan south-Slavic languages, for instance, that don't exist in English but do exist in German (case, for instance). But your native language will be an advantage when it comes to knowing how to use articles (they don't exist in the Slavic languages) to the past tenses, and to remembering irregular verb conjugations (which tend to be similar in English and German, e.g. drink/drank/drunk trinkt/trank/getrunken). It's going to be a mixed bag for every language... but since English is in the same family as German, it almost certainly takes the average English speaker less time to get proficient in German than it takes the average Mandarin speaker, for instance.\n\nDon't get too discouraged, though! Being an anglophone comes with some cultural quirks that can interfere with language learning. As a fellow English speaker, I can say that English can sometimes be a \"disadvantage\" when you're learning because it's so easy to be lazy and not actually use the language. Everyone seems to speak English and it's so important that everyone wants to speak it with you. We anglophones also have more trouble taking the linguistic low ground since we're not use to it. We're always the native speakers in the crowd of learners.\n\nSo... If you're studying in Austria, do you use German when you're out and about? Or do you default to English? Do you insist that people speak German with you once they realize you're a native English speaker and switch to English so they can practice themselves? Do you watch German TV, read German news, and listen to German radio, or do you default to English? After class, do you speak to your classmates in German, or in English?\n\nWhat do you think your classmates do?", "created_utc": "1666376218.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it8gqrf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y90clc", "parent_id": "t3_y90clc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "emcuttsy", "body": "It's great that you're learning from YouTube videos (so, comprehensible input). It sounds to me like you might need to just relax a bit more though, to be honest. Don't expect yourself to know and remember every word every time you watch a video! It takes many exposures to a word before you remember it and even more before it becomes a part of your active vocabulary.\n\nThere was a funny study where they found that just reading through the Harry Potter series was as good or better at teaching English learners academic vocabulary than normal study methods. So maybe consider incorporating some more \"play\" just enjoying English and soaking in it into your routine. Listening to podcasts while commuting or doing chores adds up hours of immersion very quickly. Comprehensible input really works (and it's WAY more fun and less exhausting than the kind of intensive watching you describe!). \n\nThis isn't to say not to do the studying you're already doing.

But try with French. **It seems like your problem is probably that you don't like French enough to spend the time immersing in it that it takes to make progress.** No amount of flashcards or textbook exercises will change that unfortunately... but the good news is that watching YouTube or listening to podcasts is WAY more fun than flashcards!

Their advice about finding media is great and I think if you're struggling to find stuff you love about French it'll be a big help to focus on discovering media in French that excites you and keeps you motivated to learn the language. \n\nAnyways, this got way longer than I was expecting it to be.

I started with Duolingo after getting fed up with being monolingual and grew into a self-study routine that I'm happy with. I hit B1 within about a year and am currently working towards C1 from B2.\n\n1. If you like Duolingo, keep using it. But only as a phone game. Don't consider it study time. Use it as a way to occupy your iThumbs when you feel like using your phone but not as a replacement for study.\n2. Use Anki to learn your core vocabulary. If you're a true beginner, you could a pre-made deck of core words to start. But I think making your own cards is almost always best. I have a free card template that automatically color-codes nouns by gender and makes fill-in-the-blank (\"cloze\") cards that might be helpful for you [https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/)\n3. Feed your Anki deck with additional cards relevant to your needs. Here are two easy ways to do this:\n   1. Get a grammar book and create flashcards based on the concepts you don't understand. The easiest and fastest way I've found to do this is to take 1-2 example sentences for a given concept and to turn them into cloze deletion cards in Anki.\n   2. Turn any mistakes you make while writing or speaking, or sentences that you don't understand while reading, into flashcards. Again, cloze deletions are a fast way to do this. Just copy-paste your mistake/the sentence into Anki and cloze the relevant parts.\n4. Up your passive listening/watching input as much as you possibly can. Podcasts, YouTube, TV, movies, audiobooks, whatever you can find that is 1) in German and 2) interesting to you. Don't worry if you don't understand entirely. So long as you enjoy listening/watching, keep going. So long as you enjoy listening/watching, keep going. If you're feeling extra ambitious, parrot the sounds you hear back while you're listening to or watching things in German.\n5. As soon as you can, start reading. People disagree on what's best to read at first, but IMO you should read the hardest things you can that you can while still enjoying it. I hate beginner stories so I skipped straight to struggling through Harry Potter with the audiobook to help me after about 3 months of vocab building with Duolingo. I'd rather fill in the parts of an interesting story that's a bit too hard for me to understand entirely based on knowing the context than read a kids book or the nth story for language learners about being an exchange student in Munich.\n6. Write write write. This is, IMO, the most helpful way you can actively study a language. Look up words you don't know and grammar concepts you don't understand as you go. Writing will show you where your weak points are. Also, you can get your writing corrected for free at LangCorrect [https://langcorrect.com/](https://langcorrect.com/journal/). Turn your mistakes into flashcards! Writing is a great way to practice productive language skills without needing to arrange for speaking time. You can get corrections on this sub as well, and on r/WriteStreakGerman\n7. Get a tutor on iTalki if you need motivation or speaking practice. German is a relatively expensive language to learn because of exchange rates, but you can still find good teachers for relatively cheap. Shop around before committing to a tutor. Find someone who will challenge you and teach you new things rather than just running through \"How's the weathery\" each conversation.\n8. Join conversation exchange sites if you like. Tandem is rather popular. I prefer working with tutors but some people really enjoy conversation exchanges. Whatever you choose, make sure you have a way to get speaking practice (if you want to speak, some people just want to learn to read/write).\n\nWhoof. Marathon post. Hope that wasn't too much. Of course you don't need to take any of my suggestions and I'm not a polyglot so maybe you shouldn't. But it kind of sounds like you're in a place where getting lots of different ideas could be helpful.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, don't stress too much. The way you study a language doesn't matter nearly as much as how often you study it.

Odds are, it has something to do with communicating with/experiencing the culture of German-speakers, right? My advice on the motivation front is to go find stuff in German that you love--TV, books, music, blogs, movies, podcasts, whatever---and soak in it as much as you can. Media is good reminder that there's a living language out there to experience (and has the bonus of helping you learn German faster). It's also super motivating to see all the great media out there that you couldn't understand before but now understand at like 60%, and to know that if you study a bit more you can get it to 70%, 80% 90%, and eventually 100%.\n\nFor faster learning during your \"real\" study time (i.e. not passive learning), I really recommend using vocabulary flashcards. It's not anything fancy, but it works. And the more words you know, the more exciting media you can consume. Check out Anki if you haven't already. I have a deck here of 1000 words I've been working on for a while ([https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/554728127](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/554728127)), and the template I made for that deck (linked in the deck description) is reusable and does all kinds of nifty things like automatically color-code and create fill-in-the-blank cards.\n\nFor grammar, you could follow one of the DW courses if you're below B2, and it'd never be a bad idea to pick up a grammar book. Hammer's German Grammar and Usage is a classic, and then there are all the various \u00dcbungsgrammatik books that combine grammar explanations with workbook exercises.\n\nOne last super motivating, super helpful thing for me was to get a tutor.

Here are some suggestions based on how I study those things:\n\n1. Get a tutor and meet weekly for conversation practice \\*and to correct your writing.\\* It's so, so helpful to get writing corrected live, and it makes for a conversation topic. I found a great tutor on iTalki, but there are of course other ways to find them.\n2. If you don't want to get a tutor, find someone else to talk to. There are free conversation exchange sites, and apps like Tandem that people use to practice languages.\n3. Drill vocabulary every day with flashcards on your phone. I use Anki and love it. There are some decent free decks, and I have a flashcard template that automatically color-codes nouns by gender and makes fill-in-the-blank cards in case you'd prefer to make your own: [https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/) Make sure you have your basic vocab (especially verbs) down, and start sprinkling in the harder words you encounter in German media as you go. I made this deck for myself: [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/554728127](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/554728127). There are plenty more free ones on Ankiweb, some leveled by A1-B2 etc.\n4. Write a lot and get your writing corrected by native speakers. I do this with my iTakli tutor but there are also online resources for this that work great. LangCorrect usually has a good turnaround time for corrections on things that aren't too long. There's also r/WriteStreakGerman and this sub.\n5. Consume a ton of German media. Finding artists/shows/movies/books that you love is super motivating. It also exposes you to a lot of vocabulary and helps with getting an intuitive feel for grammar. (If you haven't already seen them, I highly recommend Dark and How to Sell Drugs Online Fast on Netflix)\n\nThat's it.

Youtube channels, podcasts, TV, music, movies, books, blogs, whatever. Just find stuff in German that you want to consume. This is also the best way to learn sentence structure, IMO. Just consume a TON of sentences. I got to B1 with almost no formal study just by really going overboard on German media and soaking in it practically 24/7 (+ some Duolingo and some Anki flashcards). And when I get corrections on my German writing now, it's almost never sentence structure that is the problem (that's usually forgetting the genders of words, I feel your pain). I never memorized it, I just encountered enough sentences to get a sense for what feels wrong.\n\nTo learn gender of words, use Anki flashcards or some other flashcard system where you can drill nouns with their articles. It's not flashy, but it works. I have a flashcard format that will automatically color-code German nouns by gender (and do some other handy things) if you want to use it.

One thing that really helped me with my plateau was starting to work with an online tutor. If speaking is what you're after, speaking is what you should practice, and conversations with tutors can feel more like chatting with a friend after a while than \"studying.\" Also, it is low effort in that someone else does most of the heavy-lifting in terms of figuring out how you should study.I love my iTalki tutor and would love to throw her a referral, so PM me if you want a link to her profile :)\n\nPimsleur is also something to consider if you want something speech-focused that is very structured. It will help you get more comfortable responding quickly to speech, but the conversations are admittedly pretty limited (and biased towards retirees and businesspeople). At your level, I'd recommend doing the free trial of the subscription version for 1 week and seeing how the Level 5 lessons feel. If you feel like they can still teach you something, the program is very, *very* structured (30 min, 1x a day, for 30 days) and might help with getting out of a motivation slump. Skip the low-level lessons that are too easy for you at B1-B2.\n\nStill, I think t**he best advice for low-effort learning is finding podcasts, TV, and youtube channels that you enjoy**. Finding German content you enjoy  both improves your German is a great motivation to \"study\" more. German with German subtitles is great, especially at B1+.\n\nAlso, if you want to communicate complex concepts, immersion content is very important---instead of reading about how to form a complex sentence, you can simply listen to enough of them that your brain starts stringing them together itself. Educational/complex content for native speakers will help a lot more with this than structured content targeted at language learners.\n\nHere are some of my favorites:\n\nPodcasts\n\n* *Mordlust -* fantastic true crime hosted by two journalists. The cases are retold as stories, so the structure is easy to follow and if you miss something it's easy to piece together what happened from context. Also, the hosts chat a lot with each other informally so it's a good way to hear natural speech.\n* *Deutsch mit Schmidt* \\- a podcast aimed at intermediate learners. The host teaches a few B1-C2 level words/phrases and gives example sentences. Episodes are super short, and they feel more like auditory flashcards than podcast episodes. But if you're looking for structure, this is super structured.\n* *Slow German* \\- slowly-spoken short podcasts about German culture. It's for learners, and therefore tends to cover a lot of the typical tourist topics but also some very interesting ones. Great immersion for folks not ready for full-speed speech.\n* *Coffee Break German* \\- very structured. It's not good immersion content, but it's a good way to learn grammar without having to sit down with a grammar book or consume so much immersion content that you don't need a grammar book.\n\nTV & Youtube\n\n* *Dark -* watching this show over and over is pretty much how I got to A2 (it's better if you come back later and actually understand everything, of course haha). It is just great television, and the concept of the show means that scenes repeat. It's almost like spaced repetition: the show, and it rewards rewatches.\n* *How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)* \\- the best TV depiction of life as a digital native that I've ever seen. Very fun, often hilarious, and based on a mostly true story.\n* *Charite* \\- Downton Abbey but in a German hospital in 1888. There's a follow-up series set during WW2 called *Charite at War*.\n* *Altes Geld* \\- An Austrian... comedy? Austrian humor often really walks the line between gallows humor and just plain gallows. Still, I loved it (maybe an omen that I'd end up together with a dark-humored Austrian...) and it's great concept: a filthy rich Viennese man pits his family against each other to find him a replacement liver.\n* Your favorite kids animation dubbed into German - animations aren't annoying to watch dubbed like live TV is. Picking a show you already love and seeing how it sounds in German can be pretty fun (and funny, if the dubs are bad)\n* Mailab - superb science youtube channel. Even if you're not into science, it is very good, since many of the topics have more to do with social issues, popular trends, and common misconceptions than technical science.\n* MrWissen2Go - history channel with a series on pretty much whatever topic you could possibly be interested in.\n* TerraX (and TerraX Lesch & Co) - basically the discovery channel, but in German and on Youtube. Lesch & Co is physics/astronomy popular science hosted by a guy who is basically a Disney animation of a professor but brought to life and put on youtube.\n* Kurzgesagt - beautiful youtube channel with animations about science, philosophy, politics, and other interesting topics.\n* Neo Magazin Royal - German *Last Week Tonight* (and the host similarly needs a large legal team haha). The youtube channel has many complete episodes.\n\nA good place to look for youtube channels and podcasts is funk, which is a public-service content network that supports some really amazing creators.
