Posso dire che tutti i miei amici dal liceo sono andati a fare l\u2019universit\u00e0 fuorisede\u2014e io sono di NYC. Anche se qui ci sono delle universit\u00e0 molto buone, solo 5% di quelli che fanno domanda sono accettati alla Columbia, forse 15% al NYU, ecc. Quindi anche qui, se sei ambizioso, sei quasi constretto ad andare via per 4 anni, tranne quelli che a) vogliono restare qui e b) sono cos\u00ec fortunati ad essere accettati alle universit\u00e0 buone qui. \n\nE pi\u00f9 che altro, anche se sei accettato all\u2019universit\u00e0 vicino la citt\u00e0 dove sei nato, la cultura americana di andare lontano per l\u2019universit\u00e0 \u00e8 ancora forte. Conosco alcuni newyorkesi che sono stati accettati al NYU ma sono comunque trasferiti nei dorms, pochi metri da casa dei genitori, perch\u00e9 non volevano stare a casa. Dopo l\u2019universit\u00e0, io con 24 anni (e nel mezzo della pandemia!) sono tornata a casa dei miei per un paio di mesi. Sono uscita una volta con un uomo (italiano, tra l\u2019altro, lol) che mi ha guardato quasi schifato quando ho ammesso che vivevo con i miei.\n\nDetto questo: \u00e8 assolutamente vero che queste cose cambiano con l\u2019economia.

Io sono stata privilegiata e vengo da un liceo (pubblico e gratis) dove gli studenti erano quasi tutti immigranti di 1a generazione e c\u2019era una cultura competitiva in cui si aspettavano tutti di andare all\u2019universit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 prestigiosa possibile. Anche se non si potevano permettere, la maggioranza dei miei amici hanno preso mille di dollari di prestiti per pagare l\u2019universit\u00e0. Insomma in questa cultura \u00e8 dato per scontato che l\u2019ultimo anno di liceo lo dedichi a fare domanda per le universit\u00e0 e vai a vivere alla pi\u00f9 buona che ti accetti. Ma gli USA non sono tutti cos\u00ec.\n\nCerto che conosco molte persone che hanno scelto di andare alle universit\u00e0 meno prestigiose per rimanere vicino alla famiglia e risparmiare soldi.

I speak at a B2 level and I was comfortably able to both live and work there this past year, while interacting mostly with people of all ages who spoke little to no English (though I\u2019m the first to admit I make dumb speaking mistakes all the time and I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m fluent.) I also have a university degree from a good school and some savings.\n\nI dealt with a lot of the cultural differences you\u2019re mentioning (the bureaucracy, people being way more direct than in the states, different ways of socializing, everything taking longer, not being able to find food ingredients etc that you miss from home, just fatigue from never having anyone speak your native language), and so this post and all the comments really resonated with me.  BUT I still felt that through all of those issues I chose to adapt as much as I could to local ways of doing things, and I came to prefer the way of life there even when it was more difficult (hanging laundry vs drying machines, waiting hours in line for papers, etc etc) because the benefits (more time spent socializing, less emphasis on work, general sense of friendliness with neighbors) were so wonderful. \n\nPart of me really wants to pursue living there (after this all ends, obviously) via jure sanguinis citizenship, for which I think I am eligible.

A friend from the US, my home country, had planned for a long time to come and meet me in Rome for a week\u2019s visit.  In the weeks leading up to it, coronavirus in Italy started to spread like crazy (the last week of February/first week of March), and I figured no way was he going to fly to Italy. Since I was in Italy on a US gov funded scholarship, the commission controlling it had emailed us all in the meantime asking us to quit our projects and fly home, but I at first insisted on staying in Italy. I went to Rome to meet my friend and stayed in an airbnb, but brought only enough things for the week.\n\nHe somehow did fly into Rome despite the emergency situation. A few hours after he landed, the Italian government instituted national quarantine, meaning no restaurants/bars, no going outside for nonessential reasons. You also couldn\u2019t travel between cities without a motive that the police deemed \u2018urgent,\u2019 so I was stuck in Rome. (My friend\u2019s flight home got cancelled, so he was stuck in Rome, too.)\n\nThe government ended up mandating that I evacuate immediately, but my passport and all my belongings were still in my apartment in Naples.  I called to ask about going to the embassy for an emergency passport but was told they wouldn\u2019t do it. That same day Trump announced the travel ban on flights from Europe (and didn\u2019t explain that it didn\u2019t apply to US citizens) so I figured I had 2 days to get out before the ban took effect. We ended up driving roundtrip to Naples in one day (fortunately didn\u2019t get stopped), getting the passport and going straight to the Rome airport the next morning.
