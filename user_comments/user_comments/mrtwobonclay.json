My suggestion is to make the words not the sole primary key and make it take both word and reading into account. So people can study vocab that have the same kanji but different meanings depending on the reading.(not sure how this would work with reviews but its something that bugs me when using houhou) Also an import feature would be nice. Also maybe a way to customize the main theme, since you can already do that for the review session colors.", "created_utc": "1568941026.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f0uhnq3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_d6cb85", "parent_id": "t3_d6cb85", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "Yes", "created_utc": "1565056226.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ew2uk41", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cmii54", "parent_id": "t3_cmii54", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": " [https://www.daiweeb.org/terakoya/84CBFA7C](https://www.daiweeb.org/terakoya/84CBFA7C)", "created_utc": "1559333165.0", "edited": "False", "id": "epntpeh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_bv9cul", "parent_id": "t3_bv9cul", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "5 sora&moogle\nyes, vip once\nbest medals: ixion and ikairi ex, invi ex and days riku with +1000 strength", "created_utc": "1515600655.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dsh11eb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7pezom", "parent_id": "t3_7pezom", "score": "1", "subreddit": "KingdomHearts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3jo"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "Use reflect instead of guard to do damage and attack when hes stunned", "created_utc": "1514065491.0", "edited": "False", "id": "drobzoz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_7lpgy5", "parent_id": "t3_7lpgy5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "KingdomHearts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3jo"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "yellow rat snake i think", "created_utc": "1427381322.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cpreczs", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_30ct1s", "parent_id": "t3_30ct1s", "score": "6", "subreddit": "snakes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryfw"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "[this](http://vegweb.com/vegan101) and [this](http://www.livevegan.org/index.php/getting-started2) are good. also getting vegan cookbooks help", "created_utc": "1421518222.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cns2gyw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2sqtp3", "parent_id": "t3_2sqtp3", "score": "4", "subreddit": "vegan", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpm"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "this is a green tree python", "created_utc": "1418786811.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cmx90of", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2pjf11", "parent_id": "t3_2pjf11", "score": "8", "subreddit": "snakes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryfw"}, {"author": "mrtwobonclay", "body": "texas rat snake i think", "created_utc": "1418623177.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cmvagy3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_2pbyhq", "parent_id": "t3_2pbyhq", "score": "3", "subreddit": "snakes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryfw"}]
