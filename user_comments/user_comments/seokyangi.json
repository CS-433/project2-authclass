The learning curve is pretty steep (if it doesn't have a screen you'll have to learn hand-eye coordination to a level that can't be compared to things like moving a mouse etc., and if it does have a screen, since you're looking at budget options, it's likely gonna be quite small, which will also take some getting used to). With pencil and paper you just... draw. No software quirks or additional hand-eye coordination (beyond what you need for pencil/paper) or screen sizes or whatever to deal with. Also there's a reason that a lot of artists use stabilisers when drawing digitally; it's because it can never be as responsive as traditional media.\n\nBut if your issue is waste and not wanting to throw away/ruin paper etc... yeah, that's a fair point that I can definitely agree with. Personally I think what you get out of practicing with traditional materials far outweighs the waste of throwing away paper, but it's a valid point regardless. Especially since 'fear of the blank page' is not an uncommon hurdle for artists, which will be lessened by working digitally. A way to counteract that with traditional media would be to either buy the cheapest sketchbooks you can find or bulk copier paper or something and practice on that, but of course you get what you pay for, and once you've gotten to try drawing on high quality paper you'll understand why people don't use copier paper or those cheap sketchbooks for finished work. (for clarification, this is a legitimate suggestion. go get a $1 sketchbook and the cheapest pencil you can find and just draw a tonne)\n\n> To me, it looks like people start drawing on paper because of tradition or because senior artists told them to\n\nI don't think so, actually. I started out using both and even at a young age preferred pencil/pen/paper over digital for doing studies. Plenty of amazing artists start out digitally because it's what's used in the entertainment industry and that's where they wanna work (a good example would be Lois van Baarle who has been mainly a digital artist for pretty much her entire career, although even she had some traditional art education as well). Yes, art schools will usually have you work with traditional media, and I know that many schools outright disallow use of digital media for school projects (which is fair in some cases, less so in others), and for life drawing you will have to use traditional media even if you bring your iPad or whatever. But there are also plenty of art schools and courses where it's going to be entirely focused around digital art, like in animation and games art programmes. I've dropped out (long story) of 2 different games art degrees, and except for life drawing (which was limited and optional), we ONLY used digital media.\n\n> I do NOT think paper is worst or better than digital but given all the possibilities we have today, it looks to me that it should be the next stage of drawing instead of it's first step (like a pilot would start on a simulation before flying an actual plane, not saying drawing digital should simulate paper tho)\n\nNothing is easier than just plain pencil and paper. Sure, layers are nice, but you aren't gonna need them or really know what to use them for in the beginning. If you're just using pencil and paper, then learning to draw lightly and making use of erasers will eliminate any need for layers.\n\n> Like i said to my friends, when they tell me to start from paper and then go to digital, i feel like they tell me \"you should start learning how to run so you'll be able to walk perfectly\"\n\nSee, I actually do to an extent believe in doing something the hardest way around first so that you'll do even better when you're doing it the 'easier' way, i.e. start with the medium that's less forgiving (in this case traditional), because that'll be way more valuable when learning digital than the other way around. Pen/ink is considered to be one of the least forgiving mediums overall, and lots of artists swear by doing studies entirely in pen/ink, specifically because it's so unforgiving and because it'll make media like graphite or charcoal or digital media easier for you afterwards.\n\nI dunno. I think my conclusion is that ideally you should be doing both (or just traditional if you don't care about digital, of course), and in my opinion do more traditional than digital. But at the same time, if paper and pencil is all you have/can afford, then there's nothing wrong with that. If you absolutely love digital art and cannot stand traditional media, there's nothing wrong with that either. Use whatever medium gets you drawing. There's also nothing wrong with starting out digitally and then later on seeing some amazing oil painting or traditional ink piece and going 'oh I wanna learn to do that' and then... doing that. It's pretty much what I've done, as I've gone from being primarily a digital artist who does studies in pencil/pen/paper, to primarily a gouache/ink artist who uses digital when drawing for fun.\n\nLike I said earlier, my current balance is 'traditional art for school projects (most of my work)' and 'digital art when I do art for fun/outside of school' and for me that's pretty much ideal.", "created_utc": "1642448470.0", "edited": "1642449389.0", "id": "ht2sr0y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_s67x6y", "parent_id": "t1_ht2flq1", "score": "4", "subreddit": "ArtistLounge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yjxy"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "I mean, I actually think the best option is to buy a really cheap screenless tablet.

I only ended up upgrading to a tablet with a screen like... two months ago, going from [this thing](https://www.trustedreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2009/07/11488-img0218s-2.jpg) (which I got in 2012) to an iPad Pro.\n\nThe Wacom One would be the cheapest option in that case (\u00a336 here, I don't know how much it is in USD though), but if you insist on having a screen then yeah Colours Live is *cheapest*, it's just.

It doesn't help that the Switch screen is absolutely tiny either, and in my experience not very responsive to touch, at least not compared to an actual drawing tablet.

I find it way way easier to get proper practice and good habits in while working with pencil and paper than I do working digitally.

Extremely happy with it so far. However like others have mentioned, with the iPad you need to buy the pen ('Apple Pencil') separately, and since there are two types of pen ('Apple Pencil Generation 1 and 2'), it can be very confusing to figure out which iPad corresponds to which pen. IF you go for an iPad, I would recommend getting one that's compatible with the Gen 2 Pencil, as it's easier to charge (gen 2 magnetically attaches to the iPad like [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Charging-Apple-Pencil-Using-iPad.png?height=200p&trim=2,2,2,2), while with the Gen 1 you have to stick it into the iPad charging port like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0276/6463/files/How-to-Charge-Apple-pencil-2-with-iPad-Pro-2018-3.jpg?v=1542229206)). [Here](https://tipsmake.com/data2/images/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apple-pencil-and-ipad-picture-1-69S0KFsRv.jpg) is a compatibility chart. The pen is also like $100 just BY ITSELF on TOP OF 100s of $ for the tablet (although if you don't insist on getting a Pro like I did, you could totally get an older Air or just regular iPad for $200 like someone mentioned; you'll likely want the gen 1 Pencil in that case however. I insisted on the Pro as I'll be using it until it dies on me, well past its end of life updates, as my primary digital art medium).\n\nAgain, I'm extremely happy with my iPad and would recommend it if you can afford/justify it; for me, I spent some of my student loan on it with the justification of 1. it'll completely replace my current digital art setup, 2. I'm literally in art school (doing a fine art diploma at the moment so very limited need for a digital setup, but still; I was primarily a digital artist before starting my current course and will be going back to digital when I go to uni) / looking to do art as a job, 3. my old tablet broke and I don't have a phone, so I got one with a SIM card slot in order to fill both of those gaps (I used my old tablet for art textbooks and drawing references in class CONSTANTLY and not having that made it much harder on me to work efficiently; plus I can do digital colour tests and thumbnails now to aid with my traditional painting class projects).\n\nOr just go with one of the Samsungs, it's way cheaper and you don't have to mess around with Apple's bullshit lol", "created_utc": "1638018705.0", "edited": "1638019137.0", "id": "hm9r1hd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r2xucb", "parent_id": "t3_r2xucb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ArtistLounge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yjxy"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "I'm a non-binary lesbian who is very much NOT a woman (or a man). To me all it means is that I pretty much only want relationships with women and non-men, and that the (romantic; I'm ace) attraction I feel is gay/queer in nature. I do actually also identify as gay to an extent, but that's more a vibes/aesthetic gay thing - I cannot see myself in a relationship with a man.\n\nMy only connection to 'womanhood' is that I like girls/fem-aligned people in a gay way. My partner is transfemme she/they, I'm non-binary unaligned they/ae, and our relationship feels much much closer to a lesbian relationship than anything else. One additional detail is that if I were to describe us in the plural, I could say 'gfs'; as there is one fem-aligned person and one unaligned, it makes sense to me to use the feminine plural (although usually I just say 'partners' bc I don't have the energy to explain all of this to cishet people, especially since my gf is the only one allowed to use the term 'gf' for me. I'm not /a/ gf, but I can be /her/ gf).\n\nI don't want to use the term 'queer' bc it's far too vague and 'gay' is gonna make you assume I'm achillean/mlm, so I really want to use lesbian, although I only do so if I know that whoever I'm talking to won't read me as/assume I'm female; lately I've started using 'soft butch [they/ae]' as soft butch implies lesbian or at least a connection to it without implying 'woman,' and the 'they/ae' makes it clear that I'm something non-woman/non-man. I really like the terms 'faunic' ('non-man desiring relationships with other non-men') and 'diamoric' ('attraction specific to/influenced by being non-binary'), but most people don't know what those mean. I don't like trixic/neptunic/finromantic as they don't specify that it's gay attraction; you could be a masc-aligned non-binary person who likes women in a straight way and call yourself trixic, and I believe you could theoretically be a binary man and call yourself neptunic/finromantic. Gynesexual also doesn't specify that it's gay and to me it sounds like a diagnosis (similar to why I hate the term transsexual).\n\nOn the flipside, if I were to be interested in men, they would have to either be gay or like me in a gay way, otherwise I'm not interested. In that case I'd probably just call myself gay though, and not achillean/vincian.\n\nAdditionally, there is a TON of history behind non-binary and transmasc lesbians.

Similarly, I don't like being included under 'bigender' bc I feel like it implies being both male+female in some way, which is very explicitly the opposite of what I actually am).\n\nOne of the terms I use, neutrois, is also very commonly confused with agender.

A simplified way of explaining neutrois is through clothing; things like t-shirts, jeans, and trainers/sneakers can be considered gender-neutral... so that's your 'neutrality.' This is opposed to e.g. suits, which are masculine/associated with male-aligned people, or dresses, which are feminine/associated with female-aligned people. So neutrois is t-shirts/jeans/trainers, and not suits/dresses. (of course, neutrois people can dress however they want and personally being expression fluid I sometimes really love skirts and more explicitly fem clothing, but hopefully the metaphor makes sense)\n\nMaverique is a gender that's completely unrelated to male, female, AND neutrality. The clothes metaphor kinda breaks down here, but if we imagine male as blue, female as red, and neutrality as green (the inverse of purple, which is the combination of blue/red), then maverique is yellow, i.e. completely unrelated to either blue, red, or green.\n\nWhat might be a good way of explaining agender is like... I'm asexual and arospec, right? If you're monosexual (so only attracted to one gender), you're effectively asexual for the other gender(s). The attraction just doesn't exist, it's not there. Now imagine having that, but for attraction to all genders, and you're asexual/aromantic. Now imagine that, but for your actual gender identity. Or maybe, if you yourself are a binary gender, let's say you identify as female. There's no male gender there, it doesn't exist. Imagine that being the case for female /as well/, and that's agender (unless there IS a gender there that isn't male or female, in which case, yknow, you're aporagender of some sort).", "created_utc": "1636617069.0", "edited": "1636617903.0", "id": "hk6g4lz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qr9j01", "parent_id": "t3_qr9j01", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ennnnnnnnnnnnbbbbbby", "subreddit_id": "t5_u4ylu"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "While I like this explanation, it does imply that terms like 'third gender,' 'maverique' and 'neutrois'  fall under xenogender, which they really don't. I identify as neutrois/maverique, which are generally represented using white/green/black and yellow/white/orange respectively. The definition is: [neutrois](https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Neutrois) is abinary, outside of the binary of male and female, and is instead just neutral (this is different from agender, which is just no gender; if male-aligned is suits and female-aligned is dresses, then neutrois is t-shirts and other clothing items considered gender neutral [obviously I don't believe in clothing being tied to gender, but it's a good metaphor for explaining neutrois]). [Maverique](https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Maverique) is atrinary; outside of the trinary of male, female, and neutrality.

That's also why I specified 'female (gender)' in my edit bc I realised that that might've been part of your issue with what I was saying.\n\nPersonally I lean towards option 1 however; to me fem/masc are mainly tied to gender expression, not so much gender itself, i.e. (to me) male/female are genders, fem/masc are ways to express said gender (that might just be me though, I'm an expression fluid non-binary person who isn't genderfluid, so for me it's very important to be able to distinguish between expression and gender, and that choosing to express myself more masculinely or femininely doesn't imply that my gender is more masculine or feminine).\n\n> also I had a feeling you would nitpick that lol, but those examples don't really seem relevant to the conversation we're having about language in our community specifically.\n\nThat's fair!\n\n> but unfortunately, sex characteristics are observable by anyone around you, much moreso than gender quite often, and that does affect how people treat you (I hate it, but it does). so in my experience, trying to ignore my sex and pretending it doesn't matter did me more harm in the long run than facing the truth and dealing with it. if you can't accept yourself where you are, you can't become the person you want to be. but that's just my opinion :)\n\nThat's completely valid, and I can relate in a way. Figuring out that I'm actually non-binary and altersex caused me to be so much more at peace with myself and comfortable in my gender; when I thought I was binary male, seeing some feminine facial feature would make me dysphoric and depressed, but after realising I'm non-binary, I'm able to more objectively see the mix of feminine and masculine features that I actually have and feel gender euphoria because of it.\n\nBut knowing the dysphoria I felt/feel from being reminded of my sex characteristics when I thought I was male and from seeing (especially questioning) non-binary people throw terms like 'biological male/female' around (which to me are reminders of terf terminology and just feel icky), and knowing that other (especially binary) trans people still have that same dysphoria... I dunno, I'm just very much not on board with that. I was never and still am not okay with being described as a non-binary person with female characteristics or female sex or being implicitly called 'biologically female'/'born female' (through e.g. an afab non-binary person not knowing better using those terms to describe themselves; not their fault, of course), it makes me horrendously dysphoric and is something that I see very often in non-binary communities. In the end my main take on it is to leave it up to the individual to describe their body/physical sex. Personally I would use what I consider to be non-gendered and 'objective'/'factual' terms (i.e. 'afab, have a uterus, have breast tissue, produce oestrogen but am on testosterone,' etc), but if someone feels more comfortable saying they're 'a woman with male characteristics' then that's up to them.\n\n> also just ftr, I do think a trans person can achieve the opposite \"binary\" sex if they want to. I think most of us would consider a cis woman who got a hysterectomy to still be female, and vice versa for a cis man who lost his testes in an accident. they would be closer to the center of the binary after that, but would still fit into our fuzzy categories of \"male\" and \"female\" imo\n\nI will definitely agree that male/female (sex) are/should be thought of as very fuzzy categories, but I can't really agree with you on cis women getting hystos/cis men losing their testes being closer to the centre of the binary.

Aside from my mum's mother trying to have me wear a dress for Christmas once (and eventually relenting and letting me wear a band t-shirt like I wanted), I've never experienced people trying to force me to abide by gender roles. My upbringing was entirely gender neutral (I mostly wanted LEGO, stuffed animals, books and video games, so that's what my parents got me; my parents have never cared about what clothes I wanted to wear, etc). I even wore a kinda goth/gothic lolita (?) outfit including a skirt to prom once bc *I wanted to* (idk I like skirts and wish they were unisex), and then went right back to band t-shirts, baggy hoodies and jeans/cargos.\n\nAnd yet puberty caused me dysphoria and I had the same experience of just wearing baggy / neutral clothing.

I don't particularly care about (and in fact actively don't want to be) manly, although I'm pretty sure people would describe me as masculine or maybe androgynous and I'm happy with that.\n\nI dunno.

I.e. it's not a case of being a native Norwegian speaker with 0 knowledge of Danish/Swedish, it's more a case of being a native Norwegian speaker who has been exposed to a lot of Danish/Swedish and who is speaking Norwegian to Danes/Swedes who've been exposed to a lot of Norwegian.

It's North Germanic (and politically/geographically Nordic, along with Finnish), and historically Norwegian is actually more related to Icelandic (they're both descended from Old West Norse) than it is to Danish and Swedish (both Old East Norse), although that's kind of a moot point given all the Danish influence.", "created_utc": "1590700568.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fs4qxh8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_gqoxsi", "parent_id": "t1_fs4f6d0", "score": "3", "subreddit": "badlinguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ul7s"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "> I'm not sure how well you can communicate across Spanish/Portuguese as I don't speak either, but across Swedish/Danish/Norwegian it seems to be possible as long as you speak veerry slowly and clearly, and written down it is easy to understand the others.\n\nI'm a native Norwegian speaker, went to both Sweden and Denmark a lot when I still lived in Norway.

I could change it to be [w] instead, but then I've basically just got Korean consonants and Japanese vowels.\n\n(then again, afaik traditionally Finnish had no voiced plosives aside from [d], and that language still has [\u028b] so it might not be too unrealistic? not that I'm aiming for extreme realism, I just want something that doesn't scream 'this phonology is wack' lmao. although that said, I realise the orthography *is* wack, but I could not care less as that's half the point of the language for me)", "created_utc": "1566762998.0", "edited": "1566763219.0", "id": "ey3fc6z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cp8z9r", "parent_id": "t3_cp8z9r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "conlangs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2red7"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "> I do not feel strongly physically attracted to either gender.

It's not as known as it should be; I realised literally only last year that I'm actually ace and not pansexual, as asexuality = no /sexual/ attraction to any gender (but you can still feel romantic attraction and be considered asexual). It has nothing to do with libido or interest in sexual things.\n\nAnyway, reason I'm saying that is because I can massively relate to your post, from the lack of physical/sexual attraction, to the low libido (well, for me that has changed a bit due to medication, but anyway), to being into humiliation and submissive stuff, to the 'post-orgasm shame' which can be so bad for me that most of the time I honestly wish I could just get rid of my libido. I can especially relate to this:\n\n> I really find myself disgusting for the nasty things i like and wish i coukd not have such a mentality.

Even if you feel that asexuality isn't sth that is relevant to you or whatever, it might help you to just read about it and know that it's not weird to have a low interest in sexual stuff or to only be interested in a small part of it.

So I personally feel like swapping to bo3 made it easier for me to climb.\n\nEdit: I guess what I'm saying is, I think swapping to or trying bo3 is a really good idea if either you think your deck would do better with sideboarding, or if you're stuck at your rank and can't see a clear way to improve/climb without switching something up. For me, being able to sideboard forced me to get a lot better since I now need to consciously think about what deck I'm facing, how to deal with that/adapt, and so on.

Although keep in mind that I play Golgari on Magic Arena, and not in the ranked queue, as while it's super fun and probably my favourite deck next to Sultai Dreadhorde, it's not... as competitive as it would need to be, to put it that way.\n\nThe 'pure' (green+black only) Golgari deck I play looks like [this](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2093629#arena) and runs cards like [[Glowspore Shaman]], [[Stitcher's Supplier]] and as of the M20 release [[Gorging Vulture]] in order to get tonnes of cards into the graveyard as fast as possible, so that I can fuel my other cards like:\n\n- [[Molderhulk]] can be cast quicker for less mana (it costs one less mana to cast for every creature in my graveyard), and I get to play a land from my graveyard with it too (usually [[Memorial to Folly]], so I can bring back another creature from my graveyard, or just chain Molderhulk/Memorial together since they can revive eachother more or less infinitely).\n\n- [[Rhizome Lurcher]] gets bigger, faster (adds one +1/+1 counter for every creature in my graveyard). Sometimes if I get a perfect start, I'll go something like: turn 1 land + Stitcher's Supplier (2-3 creatures in graveyard) into turn 2 land + Glowspore (3-6 creatures in graveyard) into turn 3 land + Vulture (6-10 creatures in graveyard) into turn 4 land + an 11/11 Lurcher or something stupid like that. If it dies to removal I'll just recast it from my graveyard with the Memorial or [[Storrev, Devkarin Lich]] or something. And if I can't, oh well, it makes my next Lurcher even bigger.\n\n- [[Kraul Harpooner]] (gets +1/+0 for every creature in my graveyard and can fight an enemy flier when it enters the battlefield) can take down literally any flying creature at any point pretty much. The fact that it dies for it is a good thing.\n\n- And obviously [[Izoni, Thousand-Eyed]] will spawn with more 1/1 Insect tokens than my opponents can deal with once I hit 6 mana. I've won a bunch of games by just suiciding 10+ 1/1s at my opponent's face since they almost never have enough blockers to deal with it. And if they play a sweeper, I'll just resurrect Izoni and do it again. Or kill them with a 14/14 Lurcher. Either way works.\n\nI tend to play very aggro early game and send my creatures to their deaths regardless of whether they'll trade for enemy creatures or not, since it doesn't really matter once I hit a Lurcher, Molderhulk+Memorial combo, or Izoni. I've more than once played a [[Ravenous Chupacabra]] to remove a crucial enemy creature, then chump blocked with it so it gets sent to the graveyard, and played it again by resurrecting it with Memorial or Storrev. I only have 2 non-creature spells (since I'm constantly discarding my deck and have no way of playing sorceries/instants from the graveyard), and they're both Planeswalkers; [[Liliana, Dreadhorde General]] is super nice if I get to play her, but it's not a big loss if she gets discarded/hit by enemy removal, and [[Vraska, Golgari Queen]] helps keep my discard/draw engine going, but it's also not a big deal if I don't get to play her.\n\nI dunno, overall it's super fun and feels kinda combo-y without being that weak to things that take out your combo pieces. It's kinda just, 'dump your whole deck (or most of it) into your graveyard and then just play with your graveyard.' I really should get some more cards that can resurrect things though, like [[Find // Finality]] and [[Golgari Findbroker]]. Unless your opponent has a deck that you know will either kill you before you get to make use of your graveyard (so aggro decks), or something actually competitive, you kinda have this feeling of 'okay, you're killing my creatures, but that doesnt matter because eventually, I will outlast you' or 'sure, this is a bad trade, but it's only making my other creatures stronger.' If you properly want to get into the thematic aspect of Magic, then this kinda does that too.\n\nOh, I also saw in your post history that you kinda liked Gruul bc it's 'piling up a bunch of creatures and attacking with tonnes of damage.' Golgari is definitely that, except you're piling everything into your graveyard first, and then attacking with tonnes of damage, if that makes sense. You might also be into things like Jund as well, in that case (Jund = black/red/green, so you get a little bit of both Gruul and Golgari. also the current Jund decks played in standard have tonnes of big dinosaurs, which you might like).", "created_utc": "1563171294.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ettb0jy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_cdbxfa", "parent_id": "t3_cdbxfa", "score": "3", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn5f"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "Been playing for 3 months, started during WAR release (so early May).

My deck is also slightly... not optimal as I only have GB shocklands and am missing all checklands and things like Assassin's Trophy, a second copy of Vraska and a fourth copy of Hydroid Krasis. What I find though, is that knowing when to quit is super important; currently I just play until I've got my 4 daily wins, and from then until I lose once (unless getting those 4 wins just tilted me; a lot of the time I end up just playing jank in the casual queue at that point). Best case scenario, I keep playing and rank up, worst case scenario I just... go and do something else. If I still really wanna play Arena, I'll go and level my draft-only account or something.\n\nI also only play BO3 ranked, and I always sideboard! of all the people I play against, only like 10% actually bother to sideboard it seems. I dunno about Temur/Esper obviously, but my Sultai winrate went way up once I switched to BO3 and decided to always sideboard no matter what, even if I win and feel I don't need to switch anything up I'll still take a look and see if there's anything that would be slightly more optimal in the matchup.\n\nSo tl;dr: IMO, if you're not playing bo3s, maybe try that out and see if it helps. Means there's less variance across games as well (= less likelihood of losing rank to mana screw/colour screw; my complaints about mana screw went *way* down since I started playing bo3, and my deck has a pretty wonky manabase with Memorial to Folly and only one set of shocklands/no checklands), and at least personally I find it easier to actually be conscious of my actions in bo3. Maybe bc I associate bo3s with tournaments i.e. more serious play. + sideboard helps bc then you're forced to go 'do I *really* need that Cast Down or should I maybe put in Elderspell instead.' So I think in the end it'll actually make you a better player as a whole. And yeah, as others have said. If your W/R is >55%, you *will* climb if you play enough.\n\nEdit: also, you might already be doing this but.

Guilds of Ravnica has a lot of Golgari/Izzet cards that I want, while Ravnica Allegiance does not. War of the Spark has a good amount of cards that I want as well, but since you get 3 free WAR packs per week (and up until last week I did a lot of WAR ranked draft which got me lots of WAR cards too), I've chosen to focus on Guilds until I've got all the cards I want from that and/or enough wildcards to craft whatever I'm missing. I'm literally not bothering with Allegiance until I'm either satisfied with my Golgari/Izzet decks, or if I suddenly really really want to play Simic (blue+green) or something.\n\n(for reference, Guilds has black+green, blue+red, white+red, white+green and blue+black, while Allegiance is white+black, white+blue, blue+green, black+red and red+green.

It's also hard to know how much it'll impact my deck without actually crafting them, since hypothetically if memorials would drastically increase my deck's effectiveness then I don't mind spending wildcards on them, while if they wouldn't affect it that much then I'd rather craft something that would, if that makes sense.\n\nI really like the idea of replacing creature removal spells with chupacabras, so I'm absolutely trying that out!

But, being interested in paper MtG as well, I ended up buying a couple Planeswalker decks (Vraska+Ral from GRN, both of which I've obviously redeemed on Arena) and a deckbuilder's toolkit. Golgari is my favourite colour combo by far, so I've been tinkering with the Vraska planeswalker deck on Arena for a week or so now and have kinda hit a wall with it; just wondering if there are any obvious changes/additions I should make? I've mostly been playing it in the casual queue (and it actually does really well there most of the time), but I would really like to be able to play it in Ranked, although every time I've tried I've run into, yknow, actual meta decks. Now that I'm reset back down to Silver 1 I'm gonna try it again, but I don't have particularly high hopes.\n\nDecklist is [here](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1962677#arena)! I'll try and explain my logic below:\n\nIt's uh. Pretty heavily modified from [the original precon decklist](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Guilds_of_Ravnica/Planeswalker_decks); I think I've basically only kept the general theme/goal and the [[Glowspore Shaman]]s. Got 3 [[Casualties of War]] from WAR draft, so added those as a way to deal with things I can't just use [[Murder]] on. Would probably swap them for [[Assassin's Trophy]], but I don't have enough rare wildcards to craft a playset of those yet.\n\n[[Llanowar Elves]] helps massively with casting an early [[Rhizome Lurcher]] (ideally with extra Undergrowth counters from [[Glowspore Shaman]]), [[Poison-Tip Archer]] or if I'm really lucky, [[Underrealm Lich]], and later on once I've got enough land out, I can use the elves as chump blockers or sacrifices for [[Spark Harvest]] and thus feed Undergrowth. They're also literally the only 1-drop creature I could find that I thought was worth adding to the deck (the original precon runs [[Dead Weight]] as the only 1-drop; I'd rather have some creatures but yeah).\n\nI find that having 2 copies each of [[Storrev, Devkarin Lich]] and [[Underrealm Lich]] more or less ensures that I'll draw one of each per game, which is nice; same with [[Izoni, Thousand-Eyed]].\n\nFliers have basically not been an issue for me at all, thanks to the Archers and [[Kraul Harpooner]].\n\nThe one [[Plaguecrafter]] is in there bc I saw a guide on how to upgrade the original paper precon for relatively cheap which suggested adding in a few of those (along with [[Midnight Reaper]] which I ended up cutting for... some other creature, since I didn't feel like it had enough impact, especially since I've got card draw on Izoni). I only have one copy though, and while it's great when it works, I'm not sure if I want to spend wildcards on crafting more. Maybe something to put in the sideboard?\n\nAnd speaking of, I have no idea what I'm doing with the sideboard tbh, especially since I've pretty much only been doing casual bo1s with this deck so far. Mostly just adding more/more specialised removal. I ran a few [[Duress]] and [[Never Happened]] in the maindeck for a bit in bo1s, and really, really liked them (I hadn't really played around with those types of cards before), but figure they're probably better for the sideboard.", "created_utc": "1559360331.0", "edited": "1559375371.0", "id": "epp1buo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_btf84l", "parent_id": "t3_btf84l", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MagicArena", "subreddit_id": "t5_3nbzd"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "Only been playing Arena (and Magic) for a month or so, but I can answer some of these:\n\n> And Dominaria is cheaper (only 750 gems) due to the set leaving in October?\n\nNo, that's just the ranked draft cost. It was War of the Spark until last week iirc, and still cost the same, 750 gems/5000 gold.\n\n> 1 - You get 50 (3 x 14 + 8 minimum) cards for the draft events? If so, 1500 gems for the War draft event is 30 gems per card, while buying packs would be 25 gems per card? And it's not actually \"worth\" it until the 2nd win (1 win is 25.9 gems per card).\n\nWhile you're probably right about that for gems specifically (and I realise that's what your question is about, but I feel like the following is worth knowing; if you already do then ignore me!), I coincidentally did some similar maths for ranked draft yesterday: paying the entry fee of 5000 gold gets you 4 packs guaranteed (so 50 cards as you're saying) + 50 gems. Meanwhile, spending that 5000 gold on 5 packs in store only gets you 5 x 8 = 40 cards. So assuming you only care about card amount and not wildcards, you're actually better off spending gold on ranked draft than on packs.\n\n(although that said, with DOM being the only ranked draft available right now, I've exclusively been buying GRN packs with my gold and have noticed that I'm making progress on my decks much faster than when I would only spend my gold on WAR draft)", "created_utc": "1559359931.0", "edited": "False", "id": "epp0x55", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_btf84l", "parent_id": "t1_epoxyr5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MagicArena", "subreddit_id": "t5_3nbzd"}, {"author": "seokyangi", "body": "Same here, 3 WAR + 1 RNA, constructed plat / limited bronze.

Once I could understand most forms of media without having to use a dictionary (within reason; I realise that for super specific fields even natives need to look up words a lot of the time), my main goal with English was to be able to pass as a native, so I'm pretty happy about it, yeah.\n\n> I find it interesting because as much as I love my second language I would always want English to be my language of thought for my own personal world and couldn't imagine a world where it seems foreign to me.\n\nThat's entirely fair! I'm not sure I could either, if it weren't for the fact that I started using English relatively early when I was still missing a lot of, I guess, experience in Norwegian as well (not that my current age counts as experienced since I'm only in my 20s; I'm just saying that having been using English a lot alongside Norwegian for about a decade at this point, and about half of that in an Anglophone country, my experience would probably be very different if I'd only started using primarily English 4 years ago or whatever).\n\nIt also helps that Norwegian tends to borrow a lot of words from English anyway, plus the fields I'm interested in tend to be written about in English, and I in general insist on reading things in the original language if I can (which is most of the time really, because English is just used so much everywhere).\n\n(sorry for responding to a really simple question with what amounts to an actual essay haha.

And like I said, I currently play on 5600 edpi, which is sth like less than 5% of my old sens. What I did was just gradually reduce my sens until I landed on one I could stand. Iirc, I started with going down to 7000/7 (since 7 sens in-game will match your desktop sens in menus, i.e. 7000/7 in OW menus will feel the same as 7000 dpi in Windows), which is already half of my original sens.

When I hit 1000/7, I realised that I was still struggling with using my arm to aim (since you're generally wrist aiming on higher sens), and it felt super awkward, so I dropped it to a sens (800/7) where I felt that I was outright forced to aim with my arm because it was so low, which helped massively with getting properly used to low sens.\n\nI'm at a point now where I don't understand how I could ever play above 5600 edpi haha, even 6k+ feels way too fast and makes me completely unable to aim.

I started playing my current mains (McCree/Widow/Tracer) long after I had gotten used to 5600 edpi.\n\nA good rule of thumb (and the reason I run 5.6k edpi as opposed to something lower), is to be able to do one full 360 rotation if you move your mouse horizontally, edge to edge on your mousemat.

I believe anything above 10000edpi is considered way too high, and 3000~6000 is ideal unless you're a hardcore hitscan main (and even then, Pine uses 500/15 = 7500edpi and Sayaplayer uses 5000edpi).\n\nI think the default dpi for most gaming mice is around 800~1000~1200?

Also I'd go with DS games over GBA and older, since they'll have kanji. And in general, either play games you already know pretty well (or at least know the franchise), or games that you really really want to play (and preferably care about understanding).\n\nIn my experience, the best 3DS games for practising Japanese are (in order of easiest to hardest): Animal Crossing: New Leaf, Youkai Watch, Ever Oasis, Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, The Legend of Zelda (Ocarina of Time and A Link Between Worlds specifically), Monster Hunter Stories, any Pokemon game. I suspect Nintendogs would be really easy as well, but I haven't played it in Japanese.\n\nSo take from that what you will, since emulating the 3DS isn't... super viable just yet. The equivalent DS/GBA games should be roughly the same difficulty (ACWW, TLoZ:MC, Pokemon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, etc). Also, even if you have a non-JPN 3DS, Bravely Default and Pokemon would be worth picking up; the former is pretty hard language-wise, but it lets you swap voice/text language at any point regardless of region (you can even have English voices/JP text on a PAL or NTSC game if you really want), and it has a way of letting you re-watch/re-read any dialogue you've ever encountered. Pokemon lets you select your language regardless of region, but you cannot switch unless you restart.\n\nEdit: oh, also, since you're into emulation, it could be worth looking into getting a PSP. They go for like \u00a340~50 where I live, it's region-free, and if you hack it (super easy to do), you can emulate the GBA, GB/C, NES and SNES, plus it runs PSX games natively. It's perfectly possible to emulate PSP games on PC as well, I just like having a physical console as opposed to sitting at my PC with an XB1 controller playing a Nintendo game (also there's just something about playing a Zelda game on a Sony console that I find really cool, I dunno man). If you do want to try some JP PSP games, Harvest Moon is pretty easy, there's also a Katamari game (although the controls are terrible and I remember finding the dialogue really hard), some Digimon games (slightly harder than Pokemon?), and in general a stupid amount of really good games.
