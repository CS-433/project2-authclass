But often for one main reason\n\nDID/plurality can be overt like you see on TV (just like transness it's rarely if ever a good portrayal) but that's less than 1% - it's very uncommon. More often it's covert. Everyone, plural or not, acts differently in different situations. It's very easy for a headmate to blend in based on context. Not everyone experiences amnesia from a switch and even those of us who do it can often be mitigated. I do experience amnesia, but it's partial; if prompted I can recall what happened to someone else but I don't have attachment to that memory and can't recall if without a prompt.\n\nIt also hides from ourselves the same way - it's not something I was aware of for a long time. I found out after transition and reading through diaries it was obvious; we had different handwriting based on what we talked about. It's super subtle until you know.\n\nWhy does it hide, though? I say there's one major reason, but there's two related reasons. People don't commonly know about it so why would I think I was plural? Plurality is present in over 1% of people and more often in groups with systemic trauma - it's relatively common. That leads to the other part, stigma. People are afraid of it because they're taught to be - TV and movies don't show plurality in a positive light even though we're less likely to harm others (and more likely ourselves).
