Although my reading was already strong enough, I felt like my listening stuck in the A range for a long time and I struggled to understand all kinds of English audio at standard speed.

I think I made some progress into a weak B range in listening, not that satisfactory though. (Let's call it stage 2)\n\nI think the real breakthrough occurred after I took on the responsibility to handle international clients at work and started to engage myself in English communication during work time. As of now, I believe my English listening has reached the C range. (Let's call it stage 3)\n\nThe problem is that, the stages 2 & 3 add up to take more than 10 years. Plus the 10 years at school to reach stage 1, it took me 20 years to reach where I am today. That is quite a long time.\n\n//French\n\nAs of today, I have been learning French for 10 months.
