It\u2019s super fun to watch and I see your point with the parity being too much but as years go on this problem will sort itself out. There\u2019s so many good, competitive players on so little roster space right now and there\u2019s not much you can change about that yet.\n\nThe commentators are great, the games are jam-packed with action, and the league is (in my opinion) doing a good job promoting itself. I believe their TV deal is up at the end of the year and I\u2019m hoping they can sign with another provider where more games can be on broadcast television, or NBC adds some more. I\u2019ve gotten a friend who\u2019s never played passively into the league, but the lack of television coverage makes it a little harder for people like him who are \u201csort of\u201d paying attention to really indulge in the PLL.\n\nIt\u2019s great to see the Cannons as an expansion this year, and I\u2019m hoping they add more MLL identities into the league. It\u2019s a good way to make \u201cleague fans\u201d become \u201cteam fans,\u201d since I\u2019m sure there is a lot of lacrosse fans who used to have a regional team in the MLL they cheered for. It\u2019s a good way to appease people who complain about a lack of regional teams at the moment as well.\n\nThe rookies are great this year too, Carraway and Teat have completely turned the Atlas offense around. I\u2019m sad as well to not see Sowers and Gilles-Harris play, I wish they had more action this year.\n\nThe only complaint I would have is that I wish they would open up about the business side of it. A lot of the spectacle of sport is following your team off the field. If they could give every team a general manager and then maybe divvy up the teams between investors, or at least do a little more to make them independent, it honestly would deepen my commitment as a fan.", "created_utc": "1626126456.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4yvjp2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oiwh0g", "parent_id": "t3_oiwh0g", "score": "4", "subreddit": "lacrosse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ig"}, {"author": "AnarchistPigeon", "body": "That was insane wow", "created_utc": "1625329925.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3xmsw1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ocxmd4", "parent_id": "t3_ocxmd4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "lacrosse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ig"}, {"author": "AnarchistPigeon", "body": "It\u2019s at 7 central, 8 eastern", "created_utc": "1624661513.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h31r9ni", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7rsg9", "parent_id": "t1_h31q7as", "score": "3", "subreddit": "lacrosse", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ig"}, {"author": "AnarchistPigeon", "body": "Hell yeah dude", "created_utc": "1624159906.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2e5duo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o3sk2h", "parent_id": "t1_h2dqpbh", "score": "9", "subreddit": "MkeBucks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t10o"}, {"author": "AnarchistPigeon", "body": "Gurenlian would be SO good as a spokesperson/announcer of some sort.

In 2018 Paul Rabil, one of the most well-known lacrosse players, announced he was forming a league with his brother. It was gonna feature better player benefits and would attempt to reach a larger audience, which it did do by signing a deal with NBC Sports Network. I was skeptical of it but he pulled off. That is now the Premier Lacrosse League, which is a barnstorming league at the moment with plans down the road to place the teams in cities. It\u2019s not barnstorming in a financially unstable way, either. This is the model of the league.\n\nI don\u2019t think that there was any way the MLL was going to get much bigger than it already was. Only the championship game was featured on national TV, and the rest you\u2019d need a streaming subscription to Lacrosse Sports Network or something. It didn\u2019t attempt to reach to a larger audience past that. The PLL attracted 95% of the talent that the MLL had, face off masters like Greg Gurenlian and Trevor Baptiste, defensemen like Scott Ratliff, and middies and attackmen like Paul Rabil himself, Miles Thompson and Will Manny. Very little of the talent stayed with the MLL, the only superstar I can remember that stayed was Jeremy Thompson, but I\u2019m sure there are a couple others. So last month the MLL merged with PLL, adding one more club to the PLL, the Cannons Lacrosse Club.\n\nI remember paying attention to highlights and the games in the PLL, which I do not remember doing with the MLL. It was a better product. If you want the sport to grow, the PLL would be the league to get behind at this point.
