Henry Yorke was born in 1854 to Vernon and Maybell Yorke in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. He was the 3rd child out of 5.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1865, Yorke had lost his father in the American civil war. Death did not take him, although that would have been the more merciful act. His father was psychologically destroyed after the war and Yorke blames it on the Battle of Antietam, he felt later in life that his father died on that battlefield and the man who returned was merely the shell.\r  \n\r  \nNow essentially fatherless, he was raised by his mother up until the age of 16 where he decided that running the family business, a small general store, was not the life he wanted to live. So, in 1870, Yorke said goodbye to his mother and brothers and left Gatlinburg for greener pastures.\r  \n\r  \nYorke travelled to several towns in search of work which was usually farm labour, bartending or delivering mail. He never stayed long enough to find a steady job or complete an apprenticeship.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1874, now aged 20, Yorke found work as a debt collector for a local \"Businessman\" who went by the name of Jasper Hollingfield in a small town in Kentucky called Midway. As a young man who spent the last few years doing hard labour, he had an imposing figure, perfect for the role of intimidating folk.\r  \n\r  \nYorke would later describe him as \"a nasty bastard with deep pockets.\" The job was morally reprehensible but it provided him with enough money to support himself. Yorke's life changed when he was sent to a former Union officer's homestead who also happened to be a highly decorated veteran of the war who, although, was now a drunk was still viewed as a man with good character and standing, to collect a debt when the man fired upon Yorke.\r  \n\r  \nA gunfight ensued for around 20 seconds which resulted in the former officer's death. He had taken aim at Yorke's position and laid down heavy fire with his repeating rifle, however, Yorke had circled around his barn and, with one well-aimed shot, put a bullet in the man's neck. Yorke recovered the debt as well as the officer's personal Colt Navy revolver as a memento. The experience shook him and forced him to question the morals of taking another man's life. He was never comfortable with killing but deemed it necessary in certain and exceptional circumstances.\r  \n\r  \nYorke was arrested by the town marshal and put on trial but he was found not guilty. However, a southerner killing a decorated northern officer in former Union-controlled territory was viewed as a cardinal sin in that town and he was forced to flee after a mob showed up at his lodging and demanded his lynching.\r  \n\r  \nNow once again a nomad, he wandered from town to town doing odd jobs of questionable and honest repute. It provided him with enough to see through the 2 months he wandered before he settled down in Texas and soon joined the Texas Rangers in 1875. Riding with the rangers taught him invaluable lessons in tracking, pursuing, and detaining dangerous individuals. Skills that would serve him well throughout his life and career\r  \n\r  \nHe was personally involved in the arrest of Benedict Walter's gang, a group of brigands notorious for leaving no witnesses in their robberies. He also personally shot and killed key members of the \"Six Colt Boys\" and severely wounded another 3 when they were tracked to Byre creek.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough the job didn't pay much, Yorke found a living through the life experience he was earning and absorbing the wealth of information from veteran rangers. He was described as a reliable tracker and a fine gun.\r  \n\r  \nAfter 3 years of exemplary service in the Texas Rangers, he was offered the position of deputy sheriff under county sheriff Elijah Goodson. Yorke accepted the job and began work immediately dismantling gangs in the area who preyed on stagecoaches and rustling cattle. His expertise in tracking was invaluable in crushing these gangs under an iron fist. In just a few months, he had accumulated a record number of arrests; he was a well-respected deputy and a model lawman. His widest known achievement as a deputy sheriff was the killing of notorious outlaw Edward Countman and the dismantling of his crew. Edward was an infamous bank robber and contract killer.\r  \n\r  \nYorke, his fellow deputies and a posse of federal marshals tracked and cornered Edward's crew in the Seychase Valley. The marshals fired first and killed his right-hand man Billy Worthington. Yorke spotted Edward galloping away; he was stationed on the high ground, just on top of a cliff edge overlooking the narrow valley. He raised his Winchester, and, from what he states as the single best shot he has ever pulled the trigger on, shot Edward through the heart killing him instantly. His crew was cornered by Yorke, his deputies, and the U.S. marshals and subsequently arrested. He was highly praised by the marshals citing he was one of the greatest lawmen they had ever ridden with.\r  \n\r  \nYorke, after displaying a distinguished record as a deputy sheriff, was offered the position of Town Marshal of El Paso, Texas, after its previous marshal Frederick White was killed in a gunfight. Looking to advance his career, he dutifully accepted. Yorke served in this position for 7 years (1880 - 1887). During his tenure as Town Marshal, was well liked and well respected by both his deputies and people. During his final year as town marshal, Yorke encountered a situation where a group of Mexican vaqueros entered the town and started causing trouble. Yorke pistol-whipped one of them and arrested another. The third vaquero escaped. The next night, Yorke was in the saloon enjoying a meal, when the vaquero came back with a companion. They fired buckshot into the saloon, striking Yorke in his shoulder and fatally wounding his deputy, James Clark. Yorke quickly found cover and instructed the saloon patrons to keep down. He returned fire and caused the vaqueros to take cover, he fired again and managed to hit one of the vaqueros between the eyes when he peeked. The other quickly attempted to flee but was shot and detained by deputies. He died the next day.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1887, Marshal Crawford was in need of reliable and fine lawmen and asked Yorke to serve as a U.S. deputy marshal. He took the job and remained there until 1897 where he was promoted to U.S. marshal. As a federal lawman, Yorke has encountered a series of serious events. He was an instrumental figure in the defence of Valentine when it came under siege from a huge outlaw gang. He stopped the lynching of good friend and fellow marshal Tom Davies and sheriff Samuel Freeman. He has detained a large number of federal criminals and has ambitions to be, in the future, the state marshal of West Elizabeth.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1898, he set up and runs a successful business venture with J.B. Cripps selling tanned furs and hides providing him with a sizable income.
