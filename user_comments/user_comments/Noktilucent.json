The FSI categorizes Spanish as a level I language (the easiest category), assessing it takes roughly 600 hours to learn to general proficiency (At least a lower B2, likely an upper B2 level.\n\nDuolingo Spanish, if you were to complete the whole course, ALL the way to level 5 for everything (meaning roughly 5x longer, maybe more), you would get to around the upper A2 level in Spanish (while the course itself is designed to cover most B1 material). This is just an estimate from most Forums I've read.\n\nI'd consider upper A2 between 10-20% on the road to the B2 proficiency, in terms of amount learned and time put in.\n\nDuolingo Spanish takes approximately 45 hours to complete, working at a medium pace, through level 1. For the ENTIRE course, that's around 225+ hours of active learning. This is about 35% of the 'required time' (600 Hours set by the FSI) to learn a language.\n\nNow, language proficiency isn't based on time, but on progress. This is where it comes into some subjectivity: I'd say that while you're spending 1/3 of the time required for general proficiency on Duolingo, you're not gonna get 1/3rd of the way there. I'd reckon probably around 10-20% in terms of proficiency, what is truly around 100 \"hours\" of progress on the FSI Scale to proficiency.\n\nThis is a difficult concept to explain, as time must be converted into progress, then back into time (and how that relates to the 600-hour estimation from the FSI).\n\nRegarding the Duolingo efficiency then, it's quite safe to say that even with an easier language such as Spanish, duolingo is inefficient in terms of maximizing progress as a function of time. If it takes 2x longer to make the same progress as more effective study methods, than clearly Duolingo isn't efficient at all.\n\nKeep in mind that the length of the course, and the difficulty of the language, are 100% what determines how proficient you will be with the language at the end of the course.\n\nDuolingo is also not meant to be a sole tool for learning, but a good way to jump into the A2 of a language. But I'd conclude that you could get to the breakthrough A2-B1 level in FAR UNDER 225 hours using other methods with a language like Spanish, making it not-so-effective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMan oh Man, that was a LOT for a comment, sorry!", "created_utc": "1624678421.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h32knud", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_o7tkyw", "parent_id": "t1_h32igwr", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Noktilucent", "body": "\\*me laughing in the 2000+ hours i have in League of Legends over the past 3 years\\*", "created_utc": "1624675209.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h32ffdn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_o7tkyw", "parent_id": "t1_h32e77k", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Noktilucent", "body": "Thank you!

You've certainly made progress along the way, and that's something you have to recognize. \n\nOne of the biggest parts of language learning is the attitude. I know it's tough, but honestly, none of us truly learn languages easily. It's a grind. It's a process. You can't wallow in the feeling of defeat, and simply \"hope\" for results. You have to make them happen. You have to attack it head on. Find the problems that are making you struggle, and figure those out. \n\nFinally, many people never truly get to think in their TL.

So far I've tried using it for German, which I learned a little bit of this summer before now learning Italian. \n\nWhen doing it for German, I honestly think I learned a fair bit. But there's one major drawback: it's REALLY boring. I got through 3 of 20 \"units\" (essentially equivalent to chapters of a full course-book) before I gave up. While I felt like I was learning, it's more slow and repetitive than Duolingo. You spend more time with the next question loading than you do actually on the question. \n\nOne thing I do really enjoy about RS, is the method behind the teaching. They teach you nothing, in the ideal that you are \"acquiring\" your language as a child would, instead of \"learning\" like you would in a class. It's pretty cool, and actually gets you thinking in your target language. \nThe only downside to this, is that when you get to a grammar concept you don't understand, you sometimes have to look up the concept. This actually (in my opinion) turns into a positive. You're forced to think and reason with grammar and verb conjugation before you can just look it up. This makes the concepts a lot more reinforced in my opinion. \n\nOverall though, if you're looking to get past the \"slow and repetitive\" aspects of Duo, then RS probably isn't your best option. It's boring. Very very boring. If you can get through the boringness, and If you can get it at a very good price, I'd recommend it.

You'll never really reach fluency using a language program without proper practice and immersion.\n\nAs for Rosetta Stone, it does something a little interestingly, if any readers of this aren't familiar. They don't explain ANYTHING, and they offer NO translation. They expect you to pick up on things like grammar, conjugation, cases, tones, etc... without any formal explanation. You are given examples, and you select the correct picture, or speak the sentence properly.  They expect you to \"acquire\" instead of \"learn.\"\n\nThis feature is very neat in some cases, because there are times where you are speaking new sentences on the spot that you've never used before. However, this feature makes it tough to grasp grammar concepts, which is (as you said perfectly), EXACTLY why you need a grammar book or some other learning method. Pair it with Anki, Duolingo, and a Grammar book.\n\nI personally have Rosetta Stone for free through my University. When I started learning German this summer, I made a huge study program in which I'd go through an entire unit on Rosetta Stone (there are 20 total units) each week. This came down to around an hour a day, and I got through about a week and a half before I couldn't anymore.\n\nThis is my problem with Rosetta Stone personally. It's BORING. It's SO BORING. It's quite slow paced, and while progress is likely being made, it can be equally as frustrating. However, if you have enough motivation in a single language to power through Rosetta Stone (like the OP), it can honestly be pretty useful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR/My personal conclusion:\n\n\\- RS offers no translations. They expect you to 'acquire' your TL like you learned your first language.\n\n\\- It's quite boring, unless you absolutely LOVE your target language.\n\n\\- There are rewarding times where you're speaking new sentences you've never said before.\n\n\\- Reading the OP's post has made me want to give it a second try, maybe with something like Mandarin or Swahili. I'd like to see if I can power through the course over 6-10 months, and see where I stand, in terms of an estimated language level. I'd expect to be on the A2 to B1 level after completing an entire Rosetta Stone course (paired with Duo, Anki, media, etc...)\n\nEdit: Just adding this below:\n\nWould I recommend Rosetta Stone?\n\nNot as a primary resource, unless you enjoy using it. While I felt like it worked to some degree when I used it, there were more interesting ways of learning. However, if you enjoy the program, have a lot of motivation to learn your TL, and can get RS for less than full price, I would recommend.\n\nThanks for the post! :)", "created_utc": "1600439731.0", "edited": "1600440834.0", "id": "g5pek9k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_iv62y1", "parent_id": "t3_iv62y1", "score": "9", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Noktilucent", "body": "I think it gets broken up into all of the different dialects (Levantine, Egyptian) for this purpose so Modern Standard Arabic isn't included?

I look at all the things that I haven't learned, all the things I don't understand yet, and think, \"Wow. This is impossible.
