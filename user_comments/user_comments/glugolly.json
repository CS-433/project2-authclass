Just place it somewhere that makes it slightly inconvenient to check it impulsively. You\u2019ll be fine. \n\nHave a back list of books you want to read. TBR curating looks sexy on Instagram but honestly just find a book that grabs your interest and start it. Have a couple titles in mind that you\u2019re looking forward to. \n\nDon\u2019t be precious about picking your next read. Just pick one. Have a spouse or friend pick it at random. Pick with your eyes closed. Toss a coin. And if you think \u201caw man, I wanted to read _The Adventures of Blah_\u201d then there you go, you know what book to read next. \n\nFor some people multiple books at once works. I have one book I leave on our living room coffee table and read anytime I\u2019m home and have free time. I have another book I keep in my bag that I read on the go. \n\nNotes are great. I take notes. But it\u2019s ok to read and not take notes too. No one\u2019s watching. \n\nBuy used. Visit your library. Ask the librarian/bookseller for suggestions.
