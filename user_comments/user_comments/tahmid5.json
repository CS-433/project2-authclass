The children then go some distance apart and speak into one tin-can; the idea is that the sound travels down the string and into the other tin-can so the child on the other end can hear. However, I, Like many other, never really got it to work - it's not a very effective means of communication, so messages might be lost.  Crawling across the tin-can tightrope walk may therefore represent trying to bridge the distance between either the dissonant messages our culture(s) speak to us, or perhaps the interpersonal barriers that seem to be so common in the modern age, by bringing ourselves straight to the source (or unraveling the meaning and implications.) A tightrope implies peril via risk of falling, however, and crawling implies timidity in the act of traversing from one side to the other.  But then, the line itself says it is in fact safe(?)

If I choose a 2 hour study session the app should allow provisions for 5 minutes break after every 25 minutes or some other session that the user chooses. Otherwise opting for a long 2 hour session just to get a nicer tree is rarely productive as it is incredibly straining. The app should allow for breaks in a session instead of me having to choose 25 minute chunks every single time. This of course isn't just my opinion but it is backed up by research that including breaks in a long session improves productivity. If you want to make this even more feature rich, a person could set how much of their total time would be spent in breaks (lets say 15% of the total time should be breaks) and the user could also select how many breaks does he want (lets say 2 breaks). That way Forest will automatically make 2 breaks for the total chosen duration of study which will amount to 15% in total. If I did a poor job at explaining this then ask me and I'll give examples.\n\n2) Make a functional apple watch app instead of what we have right now. I'd love it if the apple watch actually showed the time remaining in the current session, that way I could just flick my watch and see how much time I have, instead of unlocking my phone.\n\n3) Make the friend list better.

However, it is always better to move to a bigger city instead of a smaller one. \n\nAnd since you specified that you don't want to act like an ass I suppose what pisses most people off are the ones who are very loud or are very passionate about politics and religion when it comes to casual conversation. I suppose avoiding those topic would be a good start.\n\nRegarding the whole application process I'd say they place the most weight on whether you actually meet the program requirements or not as they'll only take you in for programs which are directly relevant to your bachelors degree. Since your BSc is in Environmental Studies you should look for programs that are related to Env. Norwegian universities also place a lot of importance on your bachelors grade when it comes to admission. Work experience or ECA adds very little weight, if any and they usually don't even ask for it. Having said that, they do recommend that your grade must be an \"American B\" equivalent to compete. Admission itself is free so apply to as many universities as you can to maximize your chances.\n\nRemember that you'll need roughly 13k USD per year and since masters degree is a two year program, you'll need an additional 13k USD to renew your visa for the second year. \n\nSince you have 2-3 years in your hand, I'd advise you to save up more money and if you could increase your bachelors GPA then that would be a huge plus (idk how that is supposed to work, where I am from once you graduate you can't go back to increase your grades anymore).

Let me paint an analogy, if a bully in a school is beating up a kid, and the principle punishes the bully, is everybody going to side with the bully?\n\nApple vs developers paints a very incomplete and dishonest picture of reality. There are 3 parties involved: Apple/Google, developers and finally the consumers. I wonder if you have forgotten your customers, the one who are at the receiving end of the product and the ones who are shelling out their money for a service that ultimately they are trusting to be worth it. Apple does a very good job at grounding companies into obedience and thus preserving a field which makes customers feel safe to pay for. Since iOS 14 came out, a lot of apps have been caught snooping on personal data such as mic access, camera access, clipboard access, tracking prevention, etc. The truth is, companies will stop at nothing to get customers money and their data and everything in between if left to their own devices. \n\nIf an alternative app store is placed, who will monitor that these apps wont end up doing more harm to consumers, ruining their trust and stealing their data? How is that going to be ensured? You guys are putting a lot of focus on small and indie developers but the majority of the benefits will be received by the big players who are only focused on stealing consumer data/money. How is that a desirable environment? How does PM a company that focuses on privacy and makes a stance on human rights come into terms with this? Your focus on \"indie developers\" will help create a situation where customers are exploited even further. I believe PM has taken a huge misstep here siding with the wrong allies and destroying trust in the process. \n\nPerhaps you'll get to keep 100% of the profit you earn from your alternative app store, but I'll pay nothing and thus you'll get all of that nothing. What your coalition is trying to do is to shit on the gatekeeper in order to exploit the inhabitants. \n\nI sincerely hope PM reconsiders their stance on this, and I am looking forward to a reply from PM addressing the points that I have brought up.", "created_utc": "1600963530.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g6fqn5y", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_iyw6oy", "parent_id": "t1_g6fonpr", "score": "11", "subreddit": "ProtonMail", "subreddit_id": "t5_32g5k"}, {"author": "tahmid5", "body": "Thanks, I have stopped my PM subscription and shifted to another provider as my primary email provider (for anyone curious, switched to Runbox). \n\nReason: PM doesn't look good beside companies such as Epic and Spotify, both with very sketchy practices and policies and of course with shit ethical considerations. \n\nWhile the talk is about fairness, in the end it is all about bottom line.

Together you can consider that we have 4 dimensions (Minkowski spacetime) but that is like saying that you have 3 apples and 1 orange and thus you have 4 fruits. \n\nHere, I am strictly talking about mathematical dimensions. The maths behind how Euclidean dimension functions is mostly well understood for any non negative number but as for temporal dimensions, I suppose it is anyone\u2019s guess. Mostly speculative stuff at this point and I think it might remain that way for quite a while as we don\u2019t have lower dimensions of time to extrapolate from, like we do for space. For space, basically as long as you can stack lines that is perpendicular to each other, you can have extra dimensions. Two lines perpendicular to each other? 2D space. 3 lines perpendicular to each other? 3D space. 4 lines perpendicular to each other? 4D space.
