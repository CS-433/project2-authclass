Otherwise, just use Uber. It's what most Paulistanos do.\n\nDon't carry valuables, just your phone and wallet, and be careful with them. Using them in the streets in upscale areas is mostly fine, specially during the day. But be aware of bikers who drive fast past you to snatch your phone, it's a big thing in SP right now.\n\nFor things to do: well, it depends on your vibe. Sao Paulo is very eclectic. And I haven't lived there since 2018, so my recommendations might be outdated.\n\nIf you're a partying guy, you have several options. You can go to Vila Madalena/Pinheiros and walk around the dozens of \"bars\" there, it basically becomes an open street party on the weekend evenings as drinking on the street is always allowed in (and one of the best things about) Brazil. That'd be the very mainstream option, together with clubs like Vila Mix and areas like Pomp\u00e9ia, but there's variety there too. There's a thriving EDM/techno scene, but their parties are mostly in rented warehouses for what I remember, so you'd have to keep an eye on events on Facebook. If you're the alternative type, \"bars\" in Santa Cecilia and clubs downtown and around Augusta or Mooca will be more of your vibe (careful around there tho, it's a sorta dangerous area). That's where the gay clubs are, as well. There's a upscale partying scene as well but I wouldn't be able to tell you anything about it.\n\nI'm calling them \"bars\" cause they're not mine American bars in that there's no dancefloor, generally. But that doesn't matter as much in Brazil since you can just party on the street. And whatever you do, go to a Samba place. V. Madalena has some.\n\nIf you're the cultural type, SP is always littered with free events and galleries. You can walk down Av. Paulista on a Sunday afternoon and see up to a dozen museums, mostly for free. There are those cultural institutions called SESCs all over the city, with free art showings and cheap music gigs. Not to mention random festival that pop up from time to time.\n\nIf you're more of the nature type, the options are more scarce, but you can still go to places like Parque Cantareira, where you can go up a rock that oversees the city. You should also go to Parque Ibirapuera, as it is the nice downtown park in town.\n\nFor food, I'd recommend treating yourself as the options are varied and good. Go to a churrascaria. Go have feijoada and to a Minas-style restaurant. Have Brazilian street food like coxinhas in bars and past\u00e9is in street vendors on open markets. Go to an upscale sushi all you can eat, it's way better than American sushi.\n\nSP is a little short on monuments but I'd go walk around downtown (carefully) and go to the roof of Edif\u00edcio Altino Arantes. Also, have a walk on the Japanese neighborhood Liberdade, which is close by.\n\nI could go on, but this reply is long enough already \ud83d\ude02", "created_utc": "1623764511.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h1ui0sw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o0cqpa", "parent_id": "t1_h1ubbzh", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Brazil", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmku"}, {"author": "gosteinao", "body": "I'd say ~300 BRL a day (not counting hotel) should be enough to do anything you want without having to worry about it.
