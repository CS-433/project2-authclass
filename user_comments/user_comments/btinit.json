Just go back and label your time later if it looks off. I'f you're logged in, then you're working, just like you do at an office.\n\nThird - I would start looking. This boss is picking at your hours, and other people's hours, and now that you made a case about it maybe the boss is going to think you're slacking. It doesn't matter what you think. You're right. But the boss is going to start to micromanage more unless you can have an honest conversation about it. And it sounds like you already tried that to no avail. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would recommend you use a tracking software to keep it easy for yourself, you record everything, and you just keep your stupid hours up - while you look for another role with a boss that doesn't micro manage. And on your way out you can try to honest approach if you really love the company and want to stay. But this tracking and micromanaging is pushing you out. They made that decision.

It makes no sense that we can have a crazy surveillance state, the greatest military in the world, the largest economy in the world, all of our resources and advanced systems - and we can't figure out how to let a Japanese mom move to the U.S. with her American husband and American kids.   \n\n\nThe system is broken.   \n\n\nMost people think that the immigration system is about serving foreigners. But each one of those foreigners, including my  wife, your co-worker's husband, your kids' classmates' parent are all in some way related to an American citizen or American organization. A better immigration system serves Americans, not simply immigrants.   \n\n\nSo maybe you say, oh - well that's too bad, but she should get in line. Are you serious? People get in line at McDonald's. People get in line to get their cars washed. People don't need to get in line to legally live with their kids. At the airport people get in line and get irate for standing for more than an hour. Why do my kids have to either be raised abroad or have their family split up just to move back to their father's home country? Are we that incompetent?  \n\n\nThe system is broken.   \n\n\nWe can do better than this. Immigrants come to the U.S. to join their families - real American families. Those families, those American kids, those American spouses, all those who are eligible deserve a better system - a system with resources to quickly and efficiently process legal and legitimate immigration claims. A system that treats people involved as real people with real lives.   \n\n\nWe can do better than this. U.S organizations, universities, companies have an amazing selection of educated, hard working Americans available - a plethora of options to choose for workers and students to contribute to their organizations. But sometimes they can't find the right ones. Sometimes, sometimes there are a few better options. There are over 7 billion people on this planet and just over 300 million of them in the U.S. Why can't some of our American companies and American universities, if they see somebody good somewhere else - why can't they ask them to join the team? Surely they looked in their neighborhood first. Have you ever tried to hire someone? Nobody says, \"Hey, I think I'll go looking all over the world, because I'm just too lazy to look around here.\" Get real. Employers and universities, American organizations want to work with people they know. But they also want the best. And sometimes they can't find the best in their neighborhood. Sometimes, they might need someone else.   \n\n\nWe need immigration. Immigrants are some of the best people the world has to offer. Immigrants know how to struggle, how to rise above the odds, how to deal with new challenges, how to make friends, how to get along with people not like them. Immigrants are good neighbors. Immigrants are parents of Americans. Immigrants are people.   \n\n\nWe need a system that works. It should be easier, not harder, to immigrate to the U.S. We can do better than this.", "created_utc": "1652555439.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i8lwvi5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_upfwm3", "parent_id": "t3_upfwm3", "score": "3", "subreddit": "neoliberal", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfn3"}, {"author": "btinit", "body": "Why would you share criticism of something if you yourself haven't read it?  \n\n\nBro: Oh, I'm kinda' into your thing at a pop/surface level.  \nOP: Yeah, but everybody else said the way you're into it is wrong because the stuff you like is no good.   \nBro: Oh really, why don't you like the stuff I like?  \nOP: I don't know, let me get someone else's opinion about it so I can tell you why it's no good.   \n\n\nWhy don't you just read it?

Hope that helps.   \n\n\nOverall, I think you know the differences:  \nMacomb/WIU - fine place to live, small town, lower cost of living, MUCH cheaper tuition and fees, less rep but who cares, less connections which probably do matter  \nBrandies/Waltham - okay place to live but not as welcome as Macomb, tbh, thinks it's both a small town and that it is Boston, neither are true, higher cost of living, MUCH more expensive tuition and fees, better rep and I'm surprised when folks know my school but they do!, more and better connections which are rather important for connecting you to a good early job opp - although many grad students finish and don't get good connections or opps... the school will not guarantee you anything, really.   \n\n\nI'm paying off my Brandeis student loans this month. If I didn't have loans I could not have gone there, even with the sizeable scholarships they gave me. Here's a pointer - ask for more funding. They literally just gave me more funding when I asked. I was surprised, but I told them I was comparing them to less expensive places and not sure... they found the additional scholarship somehow. They may think they're better than WIU and not take that comparison, but if you name another school they might buy it.   \n\n\nBoth were good choices for me, for different reasons. But depending on your grad program Brandeis is risky but might be a better long term bet.", "created_utc": "1645523988.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxy47wb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxv99h", "parent_id": "t1_hxxwq7g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "illinois", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhco"}, {"author": "btinit", "body": "What's Macomb like generally? Cost of living and what not. What's the student/on campus culture at WIU like?  \n\n\nMacomb is a small town of less than 18,000 people, making the nearly 6,000 university students a sizeable proportion of the town's population. Macomb has a large Wal-mart, a few other small box stores, and a main drag with restaurants, banks, and other service providers. The Pella windows and doors manufacturer that came to Macomb roughly 15 years ago brought jobs, but aside from the university, hospitals, and other small restaurants and service providers there is not a lot of economic activity. \n\nThe university dominates the town, for better or worse, leading the Macomb residents and university students sometimes at odds, but altogether mostly realizing they have to live with each other.   \n\n\nLiving in Macomb is relative. In the first year I found it exciting, interesting, big and new. But I was coming from a smaller town. The university itself and university life can eat up much of your time, so the 'small town' feel of Macomb may not be noticeable at first. However, if you spend enough time there you start to not be so absorbed with university life and you realize where it is that you really live. I knew many folks from Chicago, a city of under 3 million and a metro area just under 10 million, and most of them liked living in Macomb. People are adaptable, and I would assume most people can adjust to the lack of diversity, variety, and entertainment that they might be used to from city life. The fact is, most students spend time studying and socializing with friends. And those activities are similar all across the U.S.  \n\n\nI don't know the exact up-to-date numbers on cost of living in Macomb, but I can say that it is a fraction of the cost of living in a big city like Chicago, Boston, or their respective suburbs, for instance Waltham, MA. An example, when I lived in Macomb my rent was from $200-$300/$400 a month for the entire duration, in shared housing, typically splitting a house between 3-6 roommates, each with our own bedrooms. When I lived in Chicago my rent was $550 for a tiny studio (no separate room), $750 to split a 2 bedroom between 3 people, and then in Waltham, MA, outside Boston, my rent was $600 and up for a room in a shared apartment. These prices were all years ago, so rents are likely up everywhere, but in general I would guess that rents for comparable units in Macomb vs. major U.S. cities and suburbs would be perhaps 30-50% less.   \n\n\nWIU Macomb student / campus life is big!, in that the campus itself is big. They have space. You can walk around. It's not as big as other large state schools in the midwest U.S., but it does *seem* bigger than some other east coast schools - example Brandeis. There are things to do on campus: sports; theatre; improv comedy; other student clubs; greek life; really most anything you might think of from other U.S. universities. Theatre is big at WIU, although the private schools usually have a better rep, WIU theatre folks are churning out productions, making interesting art, and having fun. Greek life seems big at WIU, although I never participated and don't think I missed much. I'm sure grad students wouldn't care or notice.   \n\n\nInternational students - I knew a few international students when I was an undergrad. They seemed to be doing okay, but, to be honest, I didn't get a lot of opportunities to interact with them. I think it is easy for folks to fall into their bubbles, so if you want to socialize and make friends you're going to have to go out of your way to get to know people in your classes or in some sort of clubs / activities. I think the Macomb community likely treats international students the same way they treat students from Chicago. To the local community, even the other Americans from *big cities* are strange and foreign, so there's no real distinction with international students. They're used to living with people from outside their small town. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing you may notice being an issue is transportation. There is a relatively convenient bus system that serves the university area but if you live too far off-campus you may find it hard to get around. Almost everyone in Illinois drives and owns cars, so if you move as an international student and don't want to buy a car you'll be reliant on the university busy system which does serve the other areas of town but just not very frequently. You can use the bus to get to shops, notably Walmart, and other restaurants and things, but it won't be as convenient as living in a large metro area. The bus system around Brandeis is not that great either, to be honest, but for there at least you can get on city buses into town, including the metra, so it's a little better connected.   \n\n\nI think Macomb is an okay place to spend a few years.   \n\n\nStudies - WIU is good at some things and mediocre at others. It has zero rep outside it's law enforcement program. Nobody is going to know where it is outside Illinois. Mostly, that's okay. But to be honest, a good school rep can be a differentiator when you're applying for jobs. It's a bad differentiator though. Good experiences are the best differentiator, and you can get those anywhere, regardless of school rep. If you think your program will get you the right experiences for you to learn - then that's good enough. Think ahead about the connections of the program to experiences and alumni, how they set up internships, etc. Those make all the difference.", "created_utc": "1645523097.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxy360i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxv99h", "parent_id": "t3_sxv99h", "score": "3", "subreddit": "illinois", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhco"}, {"author": "btinit", "body": "I literally went to WIU in Macomb for my undergrad and  Brandeis in MA for my Master's.

I don't think it's a good idea to hold back. Examples: Peace Corps provides training materials, and native speakers start talking to me in the language when I get off the plane, after my daily classes, in the village, when I'm trying to buy a soda. I don't know the phrases I need, but I know enough to try. And people want me to try. And by trying, daily, not knowing in advance, I learn the language, making the most progress when just trying with my neighbors. Should I listen / read / study everything first? Or maybe try?  \nTaxis, shops, stores, restaurants, bike taxis, market vendors, guards, police, folks all over wherever I go are relatively pleased when I use their language. Many folks around the world speak English, but I get extra points when I use a bit of their language. And in some situations, I need it, as in - I need to try to communicate in the local language to get the things I want.   \nThe idea of not-fossilizing your own non-native constructions makes sense. But who does that? Who speaks without natives? And if you get natives to understand you, then you're using the language. I would rather speak incorrectly and buy the thing I need, get to where I need to go, stop getting harrassed by police, etc.. Speaking incorrectly is a mode of communication. And when you have friends who want to help you or teachers, then you get corrections. Correction is how you avoid weird constructions. Avoiding speaking is not a great way for me to through life.   \n\n\nAm I missing something? Should I have been waiting this whole time and never used these languages? Most of them I've had the time to study for weeks online before being accosted with the language in-country. Study and try. Practice and try. Read, listen, and try.

I can't imagine what features those countries share. And that's fine. Maybe each one is interesting for a different reason. But based on the spread it makes sense to even open up your options a little more. If Tanzania, why not Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, or Zambia. If Ukraine, why not other Eastern European countries. I can't imagine you're desperate to learn another language, if so, why Belize. I would simply advise you to think about wider options. You may not yet know what you're missing.  \n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: on safety, I would guess all have issues of harassment and some are safer than others. I lived in 3 PC countries in East Africa and felt safe most of the time in all. Malawi is generally safer than other places. My experience has been that the most dangerous places seem to be those with drastic and obvious economic inequality. Malawi is unfortunately  poor throughout the country without much economic  development. Kenya has cities with poverty juxtaposed with wealth. The cities are not as safe, but even Nairobi is mostly safe, depending on where you are. \n\nAs s volunteer you'll more likely be in a rural area if you're in east and southern Africa. Those are likely to be safer. For sexual harassment, I can't say. It sucks and happens everywhere I'm sure. Maybe you can find stats on differences. \n\nFor foreigner harassment I think that's more typical in poorer, less exposed, less developed areas. In a poor village in Malawi you might not get robbed but folks will see you as a strange outsider and may call you foreigner frequently or treat you strangely. In a bigger city or more developed country that's less likely, but then economic crime becomes more likely.\n\nEdit 2: My experience was great! Although I was super negative when I finished (close of service). PC led to me finding my wife, got me into grad school, gave me the experience to start a career in international development, and strongly informed my world view about interaction with people with different backgrounds than I. Some of my views led to PC. Some are now built off that experience. \n\nBest thing I ever did. Tough. So worth it. \n\nEach path leads to more and different paths. The cool thing about PC - those path options are a bit more unpredictable. Best piece of advice I ever got was to drop my expectations. And that applies to today as well as it did then.
