We shouldn't be going into a forum if we're not keeping an open mind...\n\n>you're rather short sighted in your assessment, capitalism is just a rebranding of the fuedal system, where peasants have been tricked into thinking it was land holding that made the nobles wealthy, and the wealthy \"land holding nobles\" are now just the billionaire class.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is exactly what I was trying to say.\n\n>The way society runs is just how its always ran, the peasant class just lives a little better these days.\n\nIn terms of technology and health quality, yeah, but that's not thanks to capitalists. If anything, capitalists and the health lobby hold this back by extorting health treatments (especially in Canada, even more so in the US). But it's been documented that some peasants actually worked less per week than the standard Western 37.5-hour work week.\n\nYou accused me of being short-sighted, but capitalism and feudalism accounts only for a fraction of human history. For tens of thousands of years, humanity generally lived in what Marx calls primitive communism: \"Primitive communism is a way of describing the gift economies of hunter-gatherers throughout history, where resources and property hunted or gathered are shared with all members of a group in accordance with individual needs\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism)).\n\nWhat's more, in terms of recent history, you're also erasing hundreds of different Indigenous societies (like the Mi'kmaq, who had an extremely democratic system of direct democracy, see the book *We Were Not the Savages*) or actual still-existing socialist projects, where democracy has been expanded into the economy and the work place (hard to imagine for people like us, in Canada, who have no say at work; decisions are unilaterally decided from the top).\n\nLet me ask you as well: do you find it easier to imagine the end of the world or an alternative system to capitalism?

Many of their comrades \u2014 especially the 'Soviet anarchists' \u2013 condemned such acts as parodies of the libertarian ideal, which wasted precious lives, demoralized the movement\u2019s true adherents and discredited anarchism in the eyes of the general public.\u201d (Avrich, P., *Russian Anarchists and the Civil War*)\n\nLooting was rife among the Black Guards. The leadership of the MFAG seemed unable to discipline its detachments. The Bolshevik (and former anarchist) Victor Serge wrote that \u201cThe anarchists themselves admitted that suspicious elements, adventurers, common criminals and counter-revolutionaries, were thriving among them, but their libertarian principles did not permit them to refuse entrance to their organizations to any man, or to subject anyone to real control. They sensed acutely that their movement needed to be purged, but this was impossible without authority or a disciplined organization. Splits among them and this reverence for principle was slowly leading to the political suicide of the movement, which was becoming more compromised each day\u2026\u201d (Serge, V., Year One of the Russian Revolution)\n\nThe Black Guards were out of control. \u201cSeveral incidents such as an attack on an American car, the murder of several Cheka agents followed by the summary execution of several bandits, the arrests of \u201cexpropriators\u201d who were promptly claimed by the Anarchist Federation, led Dzerzhinsky, the President of the Cheka, to insist on the liquidation of the Black Guard.\u201d (Serge, V., Year One of the Russian Revolution):\n\nAvrich detailed it (same book as mentioned before):\n\n>\u201c\\[O\\]n the night of the 11-12th of April, armed detachments of the Cheka raided 26 anarchist centres in the capital. Most anarchists surrendered without a fight, but in the Donskoi Monastery and the House of Anarchy itself, Black Guardsmen offered fierce resistance. A dozen Cheka agents were slain in the struggle, about 40 anarchists were killed or wounded, and more than 500 were taken prisoner.\u201d\n\n \n\nIn fact, most of the so-called \"anarchists\" Mahknovist fighters were'nt anarchists at all, they were peasants who didn't care about anarchism:\n\nSee Michael Palij\u2019s study of the Makhnovist movement called *The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno*:\n\n>\u201cIt would be a mistake to assume that the peasants in the region of the Makhno movement were anarchists; in reality, they knew and cared little about anarchism or Marxism\u2026 Although some of the anarchist principles were quite compatible with traditional peasant aspirations, the basic desire of Ukrainian peasants was not the creation of an anarchist utopia but the expulsion of all the foreign invaders who exploited them and disrupted their way of life.\u201d\n\nTrotsky shares this view in Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt:\n\n>\u201cOnly an entirely superficial person can see in Makhno\u2019s bands or in the Kronstadt revolt a struggle between the abstract principles of anarchism and \u2018state socialism\u2019. Actually these movements were convulsions of the peasant petty bourgeoisie which desired, of course, to liberate itself from capital but which at the same time did not consent to subordinate itself to the dictatorship of the proletariat.\u201d\n\nArishinov (an ardent defender of Makhno) testifies in his *History of the Makhnovist Movement*:\n\n>\u201cThe majority of Russian anarchists\u2026 stood aside, asking what kind of a movement this was, why they should relate to it, and without moving they consoled themselves with the thought that the movement did not seem to be purely anarchist.\u201d\n\nTrotsky (Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs) wrote that \n\n>\u201c\\[S\\]ince the Makhnovists are sitting on the railway branch-line from Mariupol, they are refusing to allow the coal and grain to leave except in exchange for other supplies... \\[T\\]he Makhnovites are trying to establish domination by gangs and bands: whoever has grabbed something is its rightful owner, and can then exchange it for whatever he hasn\u2019t got.

Surely this is the inhumanity you bring up and are disgusted by. Apparently you couldn't care less though. Not to mention that the genocide of Indigenous People is still going on. Or even the Axis during WWII and before WWII, killing millions of people on the basis of their identity. Fascism is just a hyper form of capitalism. In fact, all WWI and WWII are just capitalist empires fighting for markets and influence. Thats millions and millions more of deaths. The death count of capitalism is in the billions.\n\nAll mainstream media in capitalist societies are bourgeois media. And all media everywhere has a bias and a class background.

And with china its treatment of minorities is just so incredibly horrid. And talking about women, the entire politburo is male. Equality is arguably worse in china than the capitalist west.\n\nSee, this is how I know you haven\u2019t studied these subjects at all. The USSR had an incredibly diverse ethnic population (~180 ethnicities). The first stratum of the USSR was the Supreme Soviet. The second stratum, which had a direct say in political organizing, were the different ethnic groups. Not only did they have their own republic, they could govern how they wanted and set their own laws, traditions, etc. Stalin and Lenin themselves were minorities.\n \n>What you\u2019re thinking of is capitalist Western \u201cdemocracies.\u201d When the US or Canada were founded, it was a strictly homogenous group of people: white men? Why? Because they either murdered, enslaved, or subjugated to the kitchen everyone else.\n \nWhat is more, today, despite socialist countries forming a minority, they are overrepresented in advancement for women in politics. Out of the five countries that have the most women represented in their respective political systems, two of them are socialists (Cuba, Nicaragua).\n\n>A genuine question, what is your rational in supporting these systems, you are truly gushing about these horrible dictators and states its quite fascinating to me.\n \nYou\u2019re misguided. See my previous comment about how China, for example, uplifted 15% of the world\u2019s population out of poverty.

Like right now you pushed the line of \u201eto fight till the last dead ukrainian\u201c ,a line often found in russian propaganda, focussing on the wests support for Ukrainians rightfully defending their homeland out of their free will, instead of focussing on the Russians that started the illegal slaughter and are even willing to cause a famine for their unjust goals.\n\nRead my previous comment, the part about Lenin\u2019s essay.\n\n>To cuba. I was shocked. So many beggars and poor people. People sometimes telling about their hardships. I started to understand why cuban Americans would vote for trump. How terrible does your system have to be to get people to vote for trump out of fear of that system.\n\nIn spite of centuries of colonialism, neocolonialism, Batista (the brutal U.S.-backed dictator who got overthrown by the revolutionaries) ransacking the Cuban treasury before fleeing, a CIA-backed invasion, 60 years of a brutal child-killing embargo, sanctions, political and geopolitical isolation, Cuba has eliminated illiteracy, eliminated much of the poverty in the country. It now has world class health care, and developed 5 COVID vaccines, in spite of being the extremely poor country that it is.\n\n>You\u2018re right. Ironically though you brought forth the same anecdotal evidence. Through my job I interact with around 250 people every week. In elections they use just 10.000 people for their projections and they are extremely close to the final result. I have interacted with well over 10.000 people many times that.

Many elites were not happy to lose their privileges and ownership for example, and there are instances where these experiments went overboard out of fear of the extreme external pressure they faced (invasions, geopolitical and political isolation, devastating sanctions and embargos, coups d'\u00c9tat, etc.) But to brush away these socialist experiments solely on that is unfair. Because for hundreds of millions of people, they were extremely succesful. See my example above about China; elimination of poverty isn't unique to socialist China. Women and minorties got incredible, never before seen advances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I get what you\u2018re saying regarding your own government and tax dollars. However you are making my point, you write about fighting imperialism at home and not abroad, yet you haven\u2019t posted about a fight at home at all. Instead you post in support of Russian imperialism in Ukraine by focussing on support for the victim negatively.\n\nI thought you weren't going to talk about my politics? ;)\n\nBut I have. As you said, if you go on my profile, you can see I shared CBC (Canadian state-funded media) articles about the Canadian government military and economicically funding Nazis.\n\nI have never posted in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I denounce it categorically. When you say \"supporting the victim negatively\", do you mean the Nazis? These are not victims. The real victims are first and foremost the working class of Ukraine, then that of Russia, then\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014that of Canada, US and other NATO countries, whose governments are ignoring its starving citizens in order to buy more and more weapons. They are willing to fight until the last dead Ukrainian it seems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How did you think the system was working?\n\nSorry, I lost you here. What is this in reference to?\n\n \n\n>I said \u201eRussians aren\u2019t the easiest to deal with\u201c. An important distinction. You are correct that large groups of people bring forth all kinds of people. Russians though are simply more difficult in certain cases. I should mention the pendulum swings both ways, they can also be the nicest people, also more so than average. Yet, of all the apathetic, cold, rude and generally difficult to deal with people an above average amount are Russian from my professional experience. Also from my private experiences travelling a clear trend emerges.\n\nGood, happy we agree. I will stress, though, that anecdotal evidence is not good evidence. If the only swan I ever see is blue, I can't assume that all swans are blue. I ought not to, in fact, because I would be dead wrong! I think the same thing should apply to Russians. I did, in fact, once get a rude Russian customer, but I don't go around telling people that Russian people are rude, because I know that to be false.", "created_utc": "1658948731.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihw1e56", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w98e2b", "parent_id": "t1_ihvf53w", "score": "1", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "humainbibliovore", "body": ">Hmm, thinking of it, what exactly is communist about the CCP? \n\nPublic ownership, democracy in the workplace, and participatory democracy (Chinese citizens have a direct say in basically all changes in China).  \n\n\n>Aren't they all just fascists? \n\nFascism is a slippery term, but it's generally described as a dictatorial, right-wing ideology based on nationalism and authoritarianism. It is very pro-business and pro-private property (the exact opposite of communism), and usually capitalizes on the fears and hatred of the populace (e.g. Hitler's scapegoating of the Jews and Communists). So no, they aren't. This is further evidenced by fascists always killing communists. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Maybe the horseshoe idea isn't right, but I see a tendency of communism turning into something else where small groups of people gain control and secure that by introducing far right ideas and methods.\n\nRespectfully, I think this is a bit misguided. Socialist countries use participatory democracy. In Cuba, for instance, this means you vote on resolutions and decisions in your workplace. You elect someone to represent you locally and provincially. These people are forbidden from spending money on campaigning, and their platform must fit on a small sheet on paper (this is in an effort to reduce lobbying/corruption). Citizens can request a recall of their representatives at any moment. In its 1975 constitution, over 5 million Cubans (about 66% of the population at the time) participated in its development. The profits/wealth made in Cuba are invested right back into the well being of its citizens, not in in the hands of a select few, ultra wealthy individuals. As for the Presidency of Cuba, the elected representatives in the Cuban assembly vote to select the President of the Council of State, who also becomes President. (I think I got all the intricacies and  terms correct, please correct me if not). For decades now, Cuba's participation in its elections has been over 85%. Cubans sure seem to believe their elections matter. In contrast, my Canadian province's previous elections had a participation of just over 40%.\n\nAs a Canadian citizen, this is almost unimaginable to me. I don't have a single say in my workplace or in the things that directly affect me. I only to get to vote for every 4 years for one of three extremely wealthy who all have a background in corporate, and are funded by big powerful corporations. We're lucky if they respect 50% of their promises, which are often easy, low-ball actions in the first place.\n\nYou may be wary of the one-party state model, which\u2014I admit\u2014, as a Westerner, I was too. But we can't look at it out of context. After its successful revolution in 1959, Cuba received incredible external and internal pressure: dozens of assassination attempts, child-killing embargo, a straight-up military invasion, diplomatic and geopolitical isolation; all of this at the hands of the US, the strongest empire in the World, infinitely stronger than Cuba, just a few hundred kilometres away from Cuba. On top of that, Fidel and his July 26th movement overthrew a brutal US-backed dictator in Fulgencio Batista, who let American corporations walk in and privatize everything.\n\nHaving a multi-party democracy exposes a revolution to manipulation and counterrevolutionary influence that could undo all of the great things from the revolution (elimination of illiteracy, near-elimination of prostitution, reduction of wide-spead poverty, etc.).\n\nAnother possible solution is that of socialist Ba'ath Syria. Before the country was destroyed by the US, its 1973 constitution enshrined that the proposed president (proposed by the lead party) had to get approval by citizens via a popular referedum.\n\nOne last word on Stalin, since you brought him up. Even the CIA, the most anti-Communist organization to ever exist, agrees with my main point. In a declassified document, the organization wrote that\n\n>\\[e\\]ven in Stalin's time there was collective leadership. The Western idea of a dictator within the Communist setup is exaggerated. Misunderstandings on that subject are caused by a lack of comprehension of the real nature and organization of the Communist's power structure. Stalin, although holding wide powers, was merely captain of a team and Krushchev will be the new captain. However, it does not appear that any of the present leaders will rise to the stature of Lenin and Stalin, so that it will be safer to assume that development in Moscow will be along the lines of what is called collective leadership, unless Western policies force the Soviets to streamline their power organization. The present situation is the most favorable from the point of view of upsetting the Communist dictatorship since the death of Stalin.\n\n[https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A006000360009-0.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A006000360009-0.pdf)", "created_utc": "1658947223.0", "edited": "1658949443.0", "id": "ihvxfg8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w98e2b", "parent_id": "t1_ihv1u2g", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "MapPorn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2si92"}, {"author": "humainbibliovore", "body": ">You\u2018d like WWI to be the analogy of choice in russias invasion of ukraine instead of wwii.

They are social democracies, i.e. the ultra-rich give concessions to the working class to appease them. You can thank the so-called \"threat\" of communism incarnated by the USSR for this. However, bringing up Scandinavian countries as a \"good example of capitalism\" is unfair, in that the wellbeing and wealth of these countries is built on the back on the Global South. Indeed, these Scandinavian countries export their misery to the over-exploited so-called \"Third World\" via extremely predatory loans and extremely cheap, near-slave labour.\n\n \n\nIf you're genuinely interested\u2014and judging by your personal attacks towards me, you're not; but perhaps some other Redditor reading this may be interested\u2014, I suggest the book [*Riding the Wave: Sweden\u2019s Integration into the Imperialist World System*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58428687-riding-the-wave).", "created_utc": "1658332220.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igxicdm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w3lmjm", "parent_id": "t1_igxbdq8", "score": "17", "subreddit": "PersonalFinanceCanada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tasy"}, {"author": "humainbibliovore", "body": "Good point.

Despite rigging the elections, Rhee still could only muster a minority government, and the increasing fragility of his dictatorship appeared to provide an opening to those who still sought unification along the lines of the original kpr. When members of the North Korean government travelled to the South to meet with opposition leaders about the situation, Rhee had them arrested. This set off a series of diplomatic shots leading most observers to conclude that full-scale war was imminent. Indeed, both Kim Il Sung and Syngman Rhee openly discussed using military options to re-unite the country along their preferred lines; Rhee was arguably more aggressive in his planning, trying desperately to convince the US to support a pre-emptive attack.71 Minor cross-border skirmishes occurred with some regularity between 1948 and 1950. Indeed, the government of North Korea claimed that the South had invaded over 2500 times to cause violence and unrest, a claim corroborated by American officials in Korea.72  \n>  \n>The North made the first successful incursion \u2014 though much evidence suggests that it was actually a counter-attack after the South captured the Northern city of Haeju73 \u2014 marching into South Korea on June 25, 1950. Rhee\u2019s forces collapsed quickly, and there was little doubt, given South Koreans\u2019 hatred of Syngman Rhee, that they would lose the war in short order. Knowing as much, the United States immediately declared this an act of communist aggression and mobilized its military for war. Canada joined a group of countries at the United Nations which claimed that North Korea had launched an \u201cunprovoked\u201d attack against South Korea and pushed the UN to take action against North Korea. Though this description of events was extremely misleading, it became the dominant narrative and was glibly repeated by Canadian historians for decades.74 The war would effectively be led by the US, while they legally operated under the jurisdiction of the UN.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n>71.

I think we can find common ground on the fact corporate interests and Canadian capital are closely and intimately tied to the Canadian government. As per a Maple analysis, [corporate executives are extremely overrepresented in JT's cabinet](https://www.readthemaple.com/justin-trudeaus-cabinet-does-not-reflect-the-economic-reality-of-ordinary-canadians/), And this is not limited to the current Liberals; seats of all political stripes in our Parliament have belonged to businesspeople since the creation of our country (this is very well documented in Tyler Shipley's *Canada in the World*, or The Maple's article [*A Guide To The Ruling Class\u2019s Domination And Destruction Of Canadian Media*](https://www.readthemaple.com/a-guide-to-the-ruling-class-domination-and-destruction-of-canadian-media/), \\[I just noticed that they recently paywalled their articles, so here's a [free podcast about this very article](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xODM5NzM2LnJzcw/episode/QnV6enNwcm91dC05NTczODgy?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiYz6fs4bT4AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCg&hl=fr-CA)\\]). This being said, the string of post-Russia invasion polls finding that Canadians are very pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia seems to indicate that mainstream Canadian media has great sway on the Canadian general population, as this is the narrative that is echoes and gives a lot of coverage to. Independent left media, on the other hand, gives very different narratives and, from my anecdotal evidence of those that I read, provide analysis that holds up to scrutiny to go with it. Especially since independant, non-sponsored media has no material incentive to push a particular viewpoint.\n\n\u00a0\n\n>In this case, Ukraine had nothing to win by trying to push into Russia, Russia had something to win by pushing into Ukraine, Russia wants to expand, resources are needed for expanding. -> Russia has motive to take over Ukrainian territory. -> Russia is a bully, and doesn't realize they have become what they have dealt through their history\n\nThis retelling leaves out what I believe to be crucial context:\n\n1. NATO, which was [founded on the principle of rivalizing the USSR](https://www.britannica.com/topic/North-Atlantic-Treaty-Organization) and even accepted high-ranking Nazis\u2014the OG haters of Russia\u2014into its ranks (also see [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip)) to achieve this, has [continuously expanded Eastward all the way to Russia's modern-day border](https://www.google.com/search?q=nato+eastward+expansion&sxsrf=ALiCzsZL2UuVkJ-1fdO8ixBcvrYyoadaWQ:1655479150659&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-2dS15LT4AhVOAjQIHSqsC-YQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1440&bih=798&dpr=1#imgrc=U5bGTwQmkMsANM). Pro-Russian voices claim this is breaking the Minsk agreements in which the West said that they would \"not expand one inch eastward\", while opposing voices say this only applied to reunified Germany. In any case, I think the principled opinion on this is that it doesn't matter; and that expanding military power all the way to the border of a rival military power\u2014a superpower, no less\u2014is inherently provocative. The [CIA predicted an invasion of Ukraine by Russia before it happened in order to \"bringing Ukraine back into Russia's sphere of influence.\"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61044063) There was also a leaked document of American intelligence explicitely stating this, but I can't find it on the web anymore. But anyone could have figured this out: when Georgia declared its intent to join NATO, Russia invaded the country. And, as I said earlier, Putin constantly demanding before and during the invasion a neutral (non NATO state) Ukraine is pretty telling. To go back to my point about mainstream media's *parti pris*, [Googling \"putin demands neutral state\" gives you nothing but editorials of corporate media telling us that Neutrality in Ukraine is a bad idea](https://www.google.com/search?q=putin+demands+neutral+state&oq=putin+demands+neutral+state&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.3690j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n2. So why does the CIA say that Russia wants to bring Ukraine \\_\\_*back*\\_\\_ into its sphere of influence? They aren't merely referencing of the fall of the USSR. More recent history has US and Canadian involvement undermining Ukrainian democracy. One notable even is the event called the Maidan Revolution/Coup in which [Canada, alongside other countries of the US hegemony bloc, funded and aided the toppling of the democratically elected\u2014though unpopular\u2014government through undemocratic means](https://rabble.ca/politics/world-politics/canadas-interference-in-ukrainian-democracy/), giving hundreds of millions to support their horse in the race, even going so far [as training Neo-Nazis on their side](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1873461/canada-regiment-ukrainien-lie-extreme-droite-azov). (I'm going to call it the Maidan Coup not because I'm pro-Russia, but because a revolution is defined by a change of system, and the Maidan Coup was a mere change in leadership.) This isn't even going into how Chrystia Freeland\u2014whom many believe to be the real decider in the Trudeau Government\u2014praising her Nazi-loving grand-father who, to put it lightly, [fanboy'd over Hitler in the seized ex-Jewish newspaper](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/chrystia-freeland-needs-to-come-clean-about-her-nazi-collaborationist-grandfather) (mainstream media has acknowledge this as well). Canada's literal vice-PM has a huge anti-Russian bias from the Nazi family she was born into. (Please note I'm not calling Freeland a Nazi, but not only has she yet to denounce her collaborator grand-dad, but she frequently glorifies him in her speeches, and [recently was holding up a neo-Nazi Ukrainian paramilitary scarf](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/freeland-nationalist-scarf-1.6372995); this is someone who knows Ukrainian hustory like the back of her hand).\n\nThis Western interference in Ukraine goes as far as [US officials handpicking the next Ukrainian PM during the coup](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957). 3. Again, I'm not trying to justify Russia's invasion, on the contrary. But I am trying to *understand why* it has done so. In order to this, we can compare its rival superpower, the US. If the roles were reversed, and the US's neighbor (for example, Mexico) suddenly declared its intent to join a hostile military pact, the US would 100% respond with aggression. Hell, the US has invaded countries that aren't even on their border for far less (Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, etc. for wanting socialism; Afghanistan, Irak for \"terror\" or inexistent weapons of mass destruction; you get the point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm missing a lot, obviously, but I think this is a fairly principled and convincing analysis of how the West, including Canada, is partly responsible for the thousands of lives being lost today in Ukraine. Professor John Mearsheimer has a great 1-hour lecture on the matter at the University of Boston, called [Why is Ukraine the West's Fault? (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4&ab_channel=TheUniversityofChicago).

In fact, Chamberlain spoke can- didly about territorial issues that were at the heart of German ambitions, noting that \u201cthere was no doubt \\[Germany\\] wanted to expand,\u201d and that he, Chamberlain, saw no problem with that, provided it was contained to areas not of interest to Britain.84 \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Indeed, everyone at the Commonwealth conference in London agreed that Germany was on an aggressive posture, but none saw great prob- lem with this and all felt that Germany was perfectly justified. The idea of a dividing of spheres of influence between the British Empire and a Greater Germany was considered a perfectly reasonable proposition. In fact, King had met a year earlier with the Soviet foreign minister Maxim Litvinoff, who had accurately predicted Nazi strategy, telling King that Hitler\u2019s primary ambition would be in Eastern Europe and Russia. King was privately quite pleased, noting in his diary that he felt Hitler perhaps had no plans to look west at all and that Anglo-German peace could be achieved by allowing Hitler to conquer Russia. \u201cIf Russia were out of the picture,\u201d he wrote in 1936, \u201cdifficulties would soon adjust themselves.\u201d85\\[...\\]King also had a warm and sprawling conversation with the German ambassador, Ludwig von Ribbentrop, who convinced King that the unfair terms of the Versailles Treaty had led to a rise of communism in Germany.87 King was naturally compelled and noted in his diary, \u201cHitler \\[is\\] in deadly earnest about the suppression of Communism, and that it had become necessary to stamp it out in Germany... in doing that, he thought he was a friend to all countries.\u201d King agreed and noted that Von Ribbentrop was \u201ca man I could get along with quite easily.\u201d88 From there, King travelled to Berlin, where he met with the British ambassador, Nevile Henderson. They heartily agreed that the Nazis were doing good work and should be encouraged to proceed, including annexing greater territory in Europe, so long as they understood that the Commonwealth would stand together if its own interests were threatened. King put it thus in his diary:  \n>  \n>\"\\[Henderson\\] said he hoped I would not take up the Eastern ques- tion with Hitler. I said I had no desire to do this because it was not part of the situation in which Canada had a special interest. We had no desire to interfere in European politics. I hoped to impress upon him Canada\u2019s attitude alike toward Germany and Britain in the matter of seeing fair-play all round; that he must not judge because of our statement we would make no commit- ment in regard to Europe that we would be indifferent to acts of aggression which might threaten the liberty, the freedom which we enjoyed as members of the British Empire.89\"  \n>  \n>The highest levels in British and Canadian governance were thus happily encouraging Hitler\u2019s expansion to the east, so long as his objec- tives did not interfere with those of the Empire. Henderson complained that the British left didn\u2019t approve of his warm disposition to the Nazis, but King reassured him that \u201cthere \\[was\\] a lot England \\[could\\] learn from Germany in treatment of masses of people \\[and\\] that Nazism was not all wrong.\u201d90 This was June 1937; the Germans had burned the city of Guernica just three months earlier and Pablo Picasso\u2019s famous mural Guernica was unveiled that very summer in Paris.91\n\nFootnotes:\n\n84.

Mussolini sent a representative, someone from Abyssinia, and it was this \u2014 not the invasion of Ethiopia\u2013 that so bothered His Majesty. William Lyon Mackenzie King, The Mackenzie King Diaries, 1893\u20131947, May 5, 1937.87. This was a bold stretch of the truth; the German left had been very active in the period leading up to 1918 and had led two revolutions in 1918 and 1919 that were brutally repressed by the Freikorps. Versailles only took effect in 1919, so blaming Versailles for the popularity of communism was a thin claim. Of course, the economic catastrophe that Versailles contributed to did exacerbate the problems Germans faced and this generated a period of high tension with both the left and the right vying for position during the troubled Weimar Republic.88.

I'm sharing in case you're intested:\n\n>The war itself began in 1950, after months of increased tension pro- voked by Rhee\u2019s embarrassing electoral failure that year. Despite rigging the elections, Rhee still could only muster a minority government, and the increasing fragility of his dictatorship appeared to provide an opening to those who still sought unification along the lines of the original kpr. When members of the North Korean government travelled to the South to meet with opposition leaders about the situation, Rhee had them arrested. This set off a series of diplomatic shots leading most observers to conclude that full-scale war was imminent. Indeed, both Kim Il Sung and Syngman Rhee openly discussed using military options to re-unite the country along their preferred lines; Rhee was arguably more aggressive in his planning, trying desperately to convince the US to support a pre-emptive attack.71 Minor cross-border skirmishes occurred with some regularity between 1948 and 1950. Indeed, the government of North Korea claimed that the South had invaded over 2500 times to cause violence and unrest, a claim corroborated by American officials in Korea.72  \nThe North made the first successful incursion \u2014 though much evidence suggests that it was actually a counter-attack after the South captured the Northern city of Haeju73 \u2014 marching into South Korea on June 25, 1950. Rhee\u2019s forces collapsed quickly, and there was little doubt, given South Koreans\u2019 hatred of Syngman Rhee, that they would lose the war in short order. Knowing as much, the United States immediately declared this an act of communist aggression and mobilized its military for war. Canada joined a group of countries at the United Nations which claimed that North Korea had launched an \u201cunprovoked\u201d attack against South Korea and pushed the UN to take action against North Korea. Though this description of events was extremely misleading, it became the dominant narrative and was glibly repeated by Canadian historians for decades.74 The war would effectively be led by the US, while they legally operated under the jurisdiction of the UN.  \n   \n71.

In this context, the \"ALM\" claim falsely supposes that the BLM claim implies that non-Black lives do **not** matter, which is completely false.
