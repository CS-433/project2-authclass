Many of those are doubles and triples for reverse and spelling though. \n\nI still use Duo but I've slowed down because the new format sucks. I put all the vocab and certain phrases into Anki. Once I got about halfway, I could pick up a lot from reading online newspapers. That becomes a good source. \n\nElementary Vietnamese is a good textbook for grammar that comes with audio. There are a ton of minimal pairs lists with audio that I believe were critical train my ear and tongue the differences between sounds like U and \u01af. I went over and over minimal pairs for a month in the beginning because nobody will understand me with the wrong pronunciation. I would love to find answers to the chapter review exercises somewhere though. It's mostly northern pronunciation with some southern, but I've been bending everything to southern on my own.\n\nVietnamese POD 101 has a free \"word of the day\" email that gives a word with a picture and pronunciation. The word is then used in 2-5 example sentences. If you were really motivated you can grab the audio of the pronunciation from the HTML and you've got all the makings of a good Anki card.\n\nA frequency dictionary will give you a list of the most commonly used words in print, but with no context. Words like \u0111\u1ec3 and nh\u01b0 obviously need context. Because it comes from news sources there are a lot of words like \"economy\" but it's good. \n\nI also married a walking dictionary. (That's way more expensive than a tutor though)\n\nOutside of that it's been tough.

I like to let them build up for several months and cash them all at once because I hate going to the bank. Anyway, this robber decides they are going to do some robbing of the place which isn&#39;t surprising because robbers really do be like that. They had some kind of rocket launcher and they were also operating a drone that was hovering just behind and to the left of them. They were standing at the glass saying they were going to be violent so I knew something needed to be done. It was a good thing I had already applied my [triple dose of Stag EdP](https://imgur.com/a/kl2A1b9). I grabbed that retractable nylon queue making barrier thing and gave it a quick shake. The nylon shot out and wrapped around the robber&#39;s legs. I flicked it again and got the middle part up across a rafter and then the retracting mechanism starting pulling the robber up in the air by their ankles. They dropped the rocket launcher, or whatever it was, and the drone must have gotten scared because it went and hid under one of the chairs that people sit in when they&#39;re trying to open a new account or get a safe deposit box or whatever. All the bank employees and the other people in line all stood up and applauded. I just deposited my checks and left.

Don&#39;t like it. Bowl gives my brush more room to stretch its wings. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of wings. Earlier today, I was walking across the Coronado bridge and a painter was painting things blue when their scaffolding began to fail. There were two of them actually. They said you ok? Then they replied no I&#39;m falling because my scaffolding sucks. Then they were like falling is going to be a bummer because this bridge is like, way up. So they said, I think you need some help. And they replied, I believe so. It&#39;s a good thing I had already applied my [triple dose of Stag EdP](https://imgur.com/a/kl2A1b9). I jumped over the ledge just as the scaffold gave way. They were all like, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, and I grabbed their arm just in time. I curled my toes around a piece of rebar to support us both. You know how a parrot hold onto a tree branch with their feet? Like that but it was my toes and it was rebar and I was upside down. Anyway, I was upside down and their legs were free swinging 2000 feet, or whatever it is, above the San Diego bay. Way up there. I was able to basically do a sit-up while supporting them in my arms and lift us both back up to the top of the bridge. They were all like thanks and then a bunch of motorists got out of their cars and stood up and applauded. A Navy ship was passing underneath the bridge and the deck was lined with something like 50,000 Navy people in their white uniforms. They all applauded too. It was pretty loud. I saw an old lady in a gold color Honda CRV and she was crying and giving me a thumbs up. Then I fixed the scaffolding and got out of there because you really shouldn&#39;t be walking around on the Coronado bridge because it&#39;s for cars.", "created_utc": "1660180102.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijsr6th", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wkppdd", "parent_id": "t3_wkppdd", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "**[Aug. 9, 2022](https://imgur.com/a/npr6F2c)**  \n\n\n* **Brush:** [Zenith - 28mm B34 - Butterscotch Chubby - With Break in Progression](https://imgur.com/a/rs5ziGJ)  \n* **Razor:** [GEM MMOC](https://imgur.com/a/HwWXR4j)  \n* **Blade:** GEM PTFE (9)  \n* **Lather:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=soap)  \n\n* **Post Shave:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n* **Post Shave:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Balm](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=balm)\n\n\n* **Fragrance:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Eau de Parfum](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=eaudeparfum)  \n\nSo I didn&#39;t have much going on and was wandering around the tarmac of San Diego International Airport.

Sometimes I get a little wood and sometimes I get more wood. But when I take a huff of Midnight Stag, I get massive wood. There are definitely woodsy notes in Midnight Stag, but it&#39;s probable the mixture of everything involved that causes me to get wood to such an extreme degree. The wood seems to last a really long time too. I shaved early yesterday and when I took a shower several hours later, the fragrance was reignited by the water I instantly got wood again. One time I was talking to u/Phteven_j and he was wearing Midnight Stag. I got in real close and took a long slow smell. I can&#39;t even begin to describe the level of wood I got off of that. Even though I&#39;ve been using Stag every day, as soon as I open the tub or splash, BOOM! Wood. Even long after I&#39;ve used it and I&#39;m in my wet shaving refractory period I can still get plenty of wood.

It&#39;s more true to the gourmand category because it encapsulates the entirety of the food harvesting process. The oakmoss, cedar, and cade represent the forest where the hunt takes place. The smoke represents the campout fire and scent lingering on the blaze orange hunting gear. Hoppes#9 of course represents the beverages enjoyed around the campfire. The motor oil and gasoline recall the ATV&#39;s used to haul gear and animal in and out. Of course the leather and birch tar represent the hide of the animal with bergamot and vanilla rounding out the spices used to flavor the meat.

I loved the feel and especially the smell. I had one of those kits where you can stamp and burn the leather to make your name on a belt or wallet or leather daddy chaps. I used to love going into the all things leather store at Northwoods Mall. You could smell the leather from outside the store and it called to me. I loved that smell and loved just wandering around in there looking at all the stuff I couldn&#39;t afford. I especially loved this [black leather biker jacket.](https://imgur.com/a/8VaobZO) The thing was obnoxious with all its accoutrements. It was loaded with zippers and a hangy down belt thing. At one point I put the thing on layaway. I have no idea what the cost of the thing was but paper route money was enough for the down payment. My plan was to never shut up about the jacket to my parents and casually leave the layaway receipt laying around so they could go pick it up for me at Christmas time. Christmas morning finally came and we did the &quot;big family present&quot; which was always something utilitarian like a microwave or VCR or something. We each had half a handful of personal gifts and even though I couldn&#39;t smell the glorious aroma of leather permeating from the one that looked the right size, I was still hopeful. I was then let down. I don&#39;t remember exactly what it was but I would still remember had it been that jacket. I eventually gave up on the jacket and got my deposit back. It was the beginning of a lifelong career of getting overly obsessed with things and then losing interest. My love of the smell of leather remains. When I had my Harley, I got a nice leather jacket that was not as obnoxious as the one I coveted as a kid. Sold the bike because they&#39;re trying to kill me out there but I still have the jacket. I don&#39;t wear it but I can&#39;t part with it. \r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why Midnight Stag is the perfect Christmas scent for me. It brings me back to my lifelong love of leather. And all that other stuff that&#39;s in there.", "created_utc": "1656174204.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idpans7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vk8bl9", "parent_id": "t3_vk8bl9", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "How tho?", "created_utc": "1656165409.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idormku", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vk8bl9", "parent_id": "t1_idoi25v", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Good advice, thanks!", "created_utc": "1656164849.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idoqj9p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vk8bib", "parent_id": "t1_idopy7n", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "I appreciate that!

Let me rack my brain to think of a soap I could &quot;theoretically&quot; use every day and not grow tired of it. In fact, I would imagine if we did a poll of r/wetshaving that asks &quot;What soap would Cosmo use every day?&quot; There would be an overwhelming response of Midnight Stag. Two people would probably put Conk because that&#39;s the kind of world we live in. Let me say this. Using Stag every day and writing up over-the-top SOTD posts about how great it is, or how it&#39;s making my chest hair come in fuller, or how it increases my prowess is a lot of fun. I get to be creative and funny and it&#39;s created a community of people that use it. There are even people like u/jeffm54321 that don&#39;t like it, but still make funny or clever posts about not liking it. But! I unironically like the smell of Stag. I especially like the way the scent hits from the aftershave splash. No one can disagree that it just hits differently than anything else out there. \r\n\r\nI got today&#39;s razor after Groomatorium had an industrial accident and spilled Stag all over a bunch of product and had to sell it at a discount. How could I resist buying a razor that had literally been baptized in Stag by an act of God?\r\n\r\nStag is my desert island shave because not only do I enjoy it, but it&#39;s fun to be all over the top about it. That&#39;s why I created my side challenge to argue for the Stag because I think it&#39;s fun. I obviously don&#39;t think it will actually get me any points, that was never the purpose. Just over here promoting Stag and looking for recruits to participate in the Order this August. Come and have some fun! If you&#39;re going to hate on it, have fun with that and be clever about it. It&#39;s just shaving soap and life is short. Here&#39;s an example. &quot;u/Phteven_j said he likes to spray on Stag before the act of love making. Fortunately, he&#39;s alone during that time and no one is there to smell it.&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\nShoutout to the PodFather u/Merikus. There was an episode where he used a Feather SR and at one point he said, &quot;Ow, that hurt&quot;. So I said, gimme that, I&#39;ll show you how to use it.

The book details a caving exploration dubbed the &quot;Connection Trip&quot; that linked two Kentucky cave systems together, making Mammoth Cave the longest cave in the world. After that, we got REALLY into caving. We did a lot of cave exploring near our home base in central Illinois, especially Illinois Caverns. We&#39;re talking, carbide lanterns affixed to our hardhats, knee pads, and a map. With no one to guide us, we explored everything from large passageways to tiny cervices where you&#39;d have to slide your hardhat in front of you as you slither along the mud. \n\nSometime in the late 80&#39;s, dad and I drove to Mammoth Cave to participate in a weeklong volunteer project known as The [Mammoth Cave Restoration Clean-up Project.](https://www.restoremammoth.com/) The project was coordinated by park ranger Bob Ward. Ranger Bob. Our goal was to remove old tourist trash and restore the cave to its natural splendor. We hauled everything from rotted out old bridges to abandoned boats that were all part of the old time tourist industry. Our reward was a chance to do some &quot;off-trail&quot; cave exploration, the parts where tourists aren&#39;t allowed. People came from all over the world to sleep barracks style and work in the cave all day. We did it for several years. We once had mile long wheelbarrow races hauling tons of rotting wood out of Crystal Cave where I tried to keep up with a few members of the British Royal Marines that had joined us that year. I even got some mild hypothermia waiting for my turn to go up the rope to get us out of the pit we were exploring. \n\nOne year our reward was a chance to retrace the connection trip that was highlighted in the Longest Cave book. That&#39;s a big deal for a bunch of caving nerds. The trip was a grueling fourteen hours though all of the obstacles we had read about. At 14 years old, I was the youngest person to ever complete the Connection Trip. I&#39;d imagine that record still holds since no one under 16 is allowed off-trial in the national park&#39;s cave system. During this trip I found a cache of old supplies, probably from the 1920&#39;s. Inside there was old carbide for emergencies, first-aid stuff, canned fish, and a metal tin labeled &quot;Midnight Stag&quot;. In fact, there was a whole shaving kit in there. I know I broke the park&#39;s rules of conservation but I took the tin home and saved it. Today I used that Midnight Stag in honor of Father&#39;s day. \n\nAfter the trip we took a rest in [Floyd Collin&#39;s](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/809830.Trapped_The_Story_of_Floyd_Collins?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=mY1wQolgFV&amp;rank=1) old house from the 20&#39;s. I passed out on the floor while dad shooed horseflies off of me. It was an amazing experience.\n\nDad went on to become the coordinator of the annual restoration project and somewhat of a celebrity in the caving world. He even wrote a book called [Underground Legacy](https://speleobooks.secure-mall.com/item/Underground-Legacy-A-personal-Account-of-Americarsquos-Premier-Cave-Restoration-Project-3673). That&#39;s the only book I know of where I&#39;m one of the characters. \n\nGrowing up camping, hiking, and caving is something that I&#39;m so appreciative of. It helped shape me into the dude I am today. Happy Father&#39;s day, dad, and happy Father&#39;s Day to all the dad&#39;s out there.\n\nEdiot: Added link", "created_utc": "1655649062.0", "edited": "1655649377.0", "id": "icy4e2m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vfoktm", "parent_id": "t3_vfoktm", "score": "17", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Have a look at this 100% authentic evidence!", "created_utc": "1655601500.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icw9pr6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vezozi", "parent_id": "t1_icw1snb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Deuces", "created_utc": "1655591265.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icvqiyv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vezozi", "parent_id": "t1_icvpys8", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "I have a feeling you\u2019ll soon have piles of it.", "created_utc": "1655579093.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icv1i2q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vf5eo9", "parent_id": "t1_icv1dso", "score": "12", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Stag is now stored under a tub of London Barbershop", "created_utc": "1655578770.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icv0u1i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vezozi", "parent_id": "t1_icuytxa", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "The hero we need!

I believe the soap base is actually from Chiseled Face. The scent notes listed are happiness, chivalry, intelligence, humor, responsibility, kindness, self-direction, trust, effort, self-awareness, empathy, helpfulness, direction, protection, nurture, attention, responsiveness, sharing, caring, honesty, loyalty, value, reliability, courtesy, self-confidence, patience, positivity, and objectivity. \n\nOff the tub the soap opens with a rush of an energetic aroma that conjures hard work and discipline. The heart features notes of congeniality and discipline that strike this reviewer as an homage to a bygone era of chivalry. After the dry-down, you&#39;re left with a base of happiness, helpfulness, and care that makes one want to seek out crosswalks to assist the elderly. The overall scent leaves one in a state of pure bliss which is easily carried throughout the day. This reviewer was left feeling trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. I give it a score of 11 out of 10. Very well done and it stands alone in its olfactory genre. \n\nShoutout to Maggard for being so good that I&#39;ve pushed my retirement back two years by spending so much money there. My very first wet shaving order was with Maggard and I continue to place orders, even when I&#39;ve told myself to not place any more orders. I love them that much.\n\n[Label](https://imgur.com/a/vPLQ15B)\n\nEdiot: typo", "created_utc": "1655561782.0", "edited": "1655562549.0", "id": "icu1mmi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vezozi", "parent_id": "t3_vezozi", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "The detail on that label is amazing!", "created_utc": "1655559488.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ictxe07", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vezozi", "parent_id": "t1_ictvwoc", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Excellent!

They said a foug\u00e8re is what a fern LOOKS LIKE it would smell. They just made it up. They took a group of scents and said this is what a fern should smell like if a fern had a smell. As if Father Nature made a mistake when he left the fern scentless. Plus they were French so they can&#39;t really be trusted in the first place. If you dig around, most experts will say that a foug\u00e8re is made of a combination of Lavender, Coumarin, Oakmoss, Russian Leather, Motor Oil, Hoppes #9, Birch Tar, Oakmoss, Gasoline, Smoke, Cedar, Cade, Bergamot, and Vanilla. It doesn&#39;t have to combine every single scent but mixture of these. There&#39;s no real science like rose is rose. Foug\u00e8re is foug\u00e8re by interpretation alone.

Look at that sexy bod!\n\nThe most expensive setup I have is most definitely Midnight Stag. I&#39;ve purchased at least four tubs of soap, four bottles of splash, and three EdP&#39;s. Maybe more, I&#39;m too lazy to go figure it out. I haven&#39;t spent even half that on any other soaps in my den. I&#39;m pretty frugal, but I will spend money on certain things when it comes to quality or lifestyle. Other things I&#39;m not willing to fork money out on. I sleep on an expensive mattress but I wear tee-shirts from Target. I carry a very expensive Coach handbag but my belt is from Vans. I have a whole bunch of solar panels but I drive a used Volkswagen. I have a nice Dyson vacuum but an old couch from Jeromes. I have expensive Brooks running shoes but gym shorts from Ross. I have shit tons of Stag but carry an old phone. It&#39;s the duality of Cosmo. Combine today&#39;s Stag with a Feather razor and a Declaration brush and you&#39;ve got a recipe for bankruptcy. \n\nDaily Challenge: Shoutout to u/ChrisDaBombz.

They say something that starts with, &quot;I&#39;m not racist but....&quot;. They spit their gum out on the sidewalk. They leave their shopping cart in an empty parking space. They fly a confederate flag. They yell at the employees of whatever business they are visiting. They let their kids run around unchecked and break things. They bring drinks to a party and take what&#39;s left home with them. They invite you to dinner because they have a business opportunity for you to hear about. They smoke with kids in the car.

I usually only shave on Leap Day because I find shving to be exceedingly painful and uncomfortable. With this new cream I&#39;m so excited and ever time I grab my wife&#39;s head and smash her nose into it she tells me that I smell like smells we never knew existed. I made all my kids smell it and put a large dot of it under their noses so they can smell it all day and we can all talk about it. What&#39;s the top razor out there? \r\n\r\nFor any of you newbs out there, let me tell you how to use this bad boy. First, what you want to do is take a small sliver of it, not too much, you don&#39;t want to waste this stuff, it&#39;s highly concentrated. I used a sewing needle that my wife uses to fix my socks. Take that small sliver and ad water to whip that bad boy up into a lather. You&#39;ll need lots of cushion so the bubbles will tell you it&#39;s working. Make sure you use ABSOLUTELY NO PRESSURE. In fact, you don&#39;t want that razor coming anywhere near your face. I left mine in the garage so it wouldn&#39;t irritate my sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the best brush for neck hair?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m so happy I found this amazing community and shoutout to u/xenawarriorprincess42069 for all your expert advice.

He was all like, &quot;I mixed a dash of russian leather with a smidge of motor oil and a sprinkling of hoppes #9 and a pinch of birch tar and a drop of oakmoss and a hint of gasoline and a smattering of smoke and a spot of cedar and a whiff of cade and a tinge of bergamot and a dollop of vanilla.&quot; And I was all like, &quot;Shut the fuck door, sunofabitch, I&#39;m in!&quot; There was some controversy because he was only releasing one tub and it would be a lottery. I chose the number 1 and nobody else entered and I won. Then everybody stood up and applauded. Maybe the old post got deleted so there&#39;s no proof but I&#39;m pretty sure this is a true story and [this tub](https://imgur.com/a/vV5GKvP) is legit.

When I was making my Lather Games run a few years back, multiple people quietly reached out to offer hardware to help me out. The mods keep the sub mostly free from douche nozzles and they do it for free. The LG judges spend a crazy amount of time and energy so we can have fun playing with shaving soap. People make monthly spreadsheets giving us info about how much stuff is being used. The vendors churn out high-quality stuff for us to obsess over. Free advice is given daily to help new people.

The center of the landing slab was emblazoned with a circle containing the depiction of a beast with eyes as red as the blood star of Tucker and antlers ablaze with green and yellow fire. The admiral had not spoken a word since departing from the Directorate command ship. Without hesitation, and as if he knew exactly where he was going, Hutchinson exited the skid and led his entourage toward a small, nondescript doorway at the bottom of a stone edifice that stretched nearly half a kilometer straight up above them. Inside the doorway was what could be considered a cave except that it had been hand carved and every angle was exactly 45 degrees. The walls, ceilings, and floors were perfectly flat and polished to a perfect shine. The precision of the stonework, combined with the natural grain of the stone caused one\u2019s reflection to seemingly peer back from one meter within the impenetrable walls. An effect that was hard to get used to. With no openings to the balmy outside world, other than the door from which they had entered, every corner seemed to be illuminated with natural light. \n\n\u201cWelcome to Karnak, Admiral.\u201d, the now familiar voice said as Phtevenj entered the view of the landing party. His face appeared even younger and more ancient than it did over the holowall. \u201cI hope you find our space accommodating.\u201d\n\nPulling down on his shirt tails to tighten the look of his uniform, the admiral replied, \u201cI thought you were just a story, something school children told each other in their imaginary worlds. I can\u2019t believe this is real.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe mind of a child, before it\u2019s made to think and feel the way the tutors want them to think and feel, is the most pure canvas in existence.\u201d Phtevenj smiled while approaching the admiral with hand extended. Three members of the executive guard quickly stepped between the two men before being shoved away by the admiral himself. Phtevenj stood a full meter taller than Hutchinson but was neither overbearing or threatening. \n\n\u201cHow many of you are there? Are you in charge?\u201d the admiral queried.\n\n\u201cOur current count is 37 with a handful of new members joining each standard year. I\u2019m a spiritual leader of sorts and while we carry different titles, we do not lord over one another\u201d, came the reply before being interrupted by a new voice entering the chamber. \n\nA woman came into view standing another half meter above the Grand Antler, as Phtevenj was referred. She was covered in plate armor with the hue of flame kissed titanium but with hundreds of times the strength and appeared to have no weight at all. When viewed from one angle her hair was blacker than a moonless night, and when viewed from the other it appeared more pale than the elf queens of the farthest nebulae. Under her arm she carried her headpiece known as a heaume, adorned with antlers that appeared to be made of living tissue.\n\n\u201cGreetings, Noble one\u201d the Grand Antler said to the woman who appeared to the admiral as one of the most powerful creatures he had ever witnessed. \u201cMay I introduce one of our Noble Officers, Ador Eyou, as said in our native tongue. Our most fearsome warrior.\u201d \n\nAt that very moment a massive explosion rocked Karnak. The landing skid erupted in a ball of purple fire as a result of a direct hit from a Lavederian magnecannon. The skid disappeared into a trillion pieces but Karnak seemed unphased.  \n\n\u201cGo.\u201d Phtevenj said as a matter of fact and Ador Eyou let out a whistle that pierced the air like a falcon\u2019s cry. The landing party turned to see the most magnificent beast that was ever to exist. It stood 12 meters high and its midnight black coat seemed to comprise a billion iridescent strands of iron growing from its shimmering skin. Silk white smoke shot from the nostrils of the beast as it chortled. The antlers, extending above the smoking head, reached another meter in height and were alight with a yellow-green fire from which the heat could be felt even at a distance. The eyes shone a color of red only seen by warriors as they spill the blood of their enemy and it pours from still beating hearts. Every centimeter of the creature was covered in muscle that appeared to be covered again in even more muscle. The ground shook as the animal slowly walked forward towards its pilot, Ador Eyou. A knight and their steed were paired for life. Ador Eyou and the beast both lurched simultaneously, Ador straight up and the beast straight forward. They joined together as if in a well rehearsed ballet when Ador Eyou landed silently on the back of the flaming monstrosity, twisting the fine hair of the nape into her flawless hand. The animal reared back and let loose a deafening roar as the antler flame doubled in height and the smoke shot in rings to the ground. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d mumbled Admiral Hutchinson, clearly in a state of shock. \u201cThey exist.\u201d He said. \u201cThe Midnight Stag exist!\u201d  \n\nThe shortest member of the Executive Guard turned to face the awestruck Admiral. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, sir, but I\u2019m ready to take out these Lavenderpy bastards for destroying my ship!\u201d\n\nTo be continued\u2026.

Tucker isn\u2019t remote as defined by distance, being only 276 million light years from where Earth once exited. Its remoteness is in that it remains largely untouched as it orbits the blood red star, Relided-A. Superstition and lore have mostly kept its neighbors from entering the jungle planet. Tucker\u2019s only humanoid inhabitants are a small band of monks that live in peace amongst the vast number of unimaginable flora and fauna, crafting a kind of bourbon in their self-inflicted exile. Nemes trees crowd every land mass, reaching 600 meters into the haze and oozing a sweet, milk-white fluid rumored to contain life extending medicinal properties. It\u2019s not medicine the Lavenderians are after, but another newly-discovered benefit of nemes nectar, warp fuel.  \n\nWhen the Directorate command ship exited the time-loop, the Lavenderian mining ship, stretching 2.5 kilometers in length, was already in orbit around the steamy planet. \n\n\u201cAdmiral, we\u2019re approaching the source of the signal now.\u201d, exclaimed a junior lieutenant fresh out of the academy. \n\n\u201cI can see that, lieutenant.\u201d a salty Admiral Hutchinson replied from the helm. Hutchinson, a rather wirey guy, was born into the Directorate and had built a reputation of by-the-book leadership that had landed him his first command at the tender age of 27. A record for the Directorate as his next youngest peer first took command at age 41 and that was during the time of the destruction of the Milky Way galaxy, when it seemed anyone could be made commander. Hutchinson was also a great historian with a particular interest in obscure history and lore. \u201cNow, who do we suppose sent a distress signal from this waste of a planet?\u201d Hutchinson seemed to ask himself out loud.\n\n\u201cSir, we\u2019re receiving a message on the holowall.\u201d, the lieutenant said, this time trying to speak in a way as to avoid admonishment. \n\n\u201cPull it up, Jeff\u201d, Hutchinson replied without condescension. The wirey admiral liked lieutenant Jeff Mason for his strict adherence to policy. Jeff M, as he was officially referred to by the rest of the crew, was a self-appointed enforcer of cruise-deck procedure. It was no secret that the victims of his admonishments had given him the nickname of the \u201cDQ police\u201d, but no one would dare utter that when he was within earshot.  \n\nThe holowall stuttered as its blue-green light cast the three dimensional image of a cloaked and hooded man into the viewing orb. The unsteadiness of the holowall didn\u2019t concern the admiral but he made note of it. \n\nThe admiral, standing with his hands clasped formally behind his back and feet spread unnaturally wide so as to appear less tall than he really was, asked the figure, \u201cTo whom do I have the pleasure?\u201d Hutchinson had picked up this greeting from a favorite instructor at the academy and used it frequently when speaking with someone for the first time.   \n\n\u201cGreetings, admiral. Many thanks to the Directorate for your hasty reply.\u201d Came the response from the image on the holowall. The face appeared to be that of a young man, somehow looking simultaneously ancient. His skin was without blemish and his cloak cast a shadow under his jet black eyes. The twinkling reflection of fire was the only thing giving the pupils luster. A twisted patch of red-brown hair graced his chin, giving him the look of a learned hermit. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the Lavanderians have decided to pay our peaceful planet a visit. We are asking the Directorate\u2019s assistance in removing this threat as we want to avoid disruption of our practices and prevent any loss of life.\u201d  \n\nFor unidentifiable reasons, Hutchinson had an immediate trust in the stranger. Even though the figure was only a projection, a strange sense of reverence and power had filled the cruise deck and was noticed by the entire crew. The admiral had an unnatural, albeit brief, difficulty in formulating a response. \u201cThe Lavenderians are a nasty bunch of scavengers.\u201d, Hutchinson was finally able to utter. \u201cWe can act as a political deterrent but I can\u2019t promise complete avoidance in some loss of life of your population. These barbarians are known for their propensity to violence, especially when it comes to protecting their mining interests, mister\u2026..\u201d, the admiral trailed off, subtly requesting the name of the stranger again.\n\n\u201cMy given name is Phtevenj, Stephen in the standard tongue.\u201d, came the words from the holowall, completely sucking the air out of the admiral\u2019s chest, causing him to stand upright at his full 205 centemeter wirey stature. \u201cIt\u2019s not our lives we fear losing, admiral, but the lives of the Lavenderians should they decide to attack. Our humble ranks have taken a vow to protect life but will defend our lands against any attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady my landing skid\u201d, Hutchinson stuttered. \n\n\u201cSir?\u201d, asked Jeff M.\n\n\u201cI said, ready my landing skid\u201d, repeated the admiral, this time with a sense of consternation. \n\n\u201cSir, an admiral landing on a previously uncharted planet is highly against protocol\u201d, Jeff M retorted, trying to puff out his chest.  \n\n\u201cI am NOT a robot, lieutenant! I will decide when and how to follow the protocol!\u201d Shouted Hutchinson with a peculiar emphasis on the word protocol, sending the lieutenant skulking back to his viewing porthole. \u201cPlease provide your coordinates, Stephen, if I may call you that. I should like to meet you.\u201d the admiral said, turning again to the holowall, trying in vain to hide the quakiness that had hijacked his usually unwavering voice.\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/v5w16h/comment/ibd506b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "created_utc": "1654522241.0", "edited": "1654522636.0", "id": "ibd4tly", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v5w16h", "parent_id": "t3_v5w16h", "score": "27", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Quality", "created_utc": "1654441553.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib9bxtw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v574pe", "parent_id": "t1_ib8v1dd", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "**[June 5, 2022 - Dupelg\u00e4nger Day](https://imgur.com/a/g7zNONl)**  \n\n\n* **Brush:** [Stirling 24mm Boar](https://imgur.com/a/5WYYjJl)  \n* **Razor:** [Univinlions Clonisori](https://imgur.com/a/60GbfuZ)  \n* **Blade:** Kai - Captain Sharpblade (5)  \n* **Lather:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Soap](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=soap)  \n\n* **Post Shave:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=aftershave)\n\n* **Post Shave:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Balm](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=balm)\n\n\n* **Fragrance:** [Chiseled Face - Midnight Stag - Eau de Parfum](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/32/?product_type=eaudeparfum)  \n\n[He&#39;s](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/v574pe/comment/ib87g2x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) something of a Dupelg\u00e4nger himself\r\n\r\n[Photo](https://imgur.com/a/g7zNONl)", "created_utc": "1654411605.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ib87px1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v574pe", "parent_id": "t3_v574pe", "score": "29", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "I accidentally bought the extra strength Gold Bond.

I managed to avoid it for a while. The thought of trying would occasionally run through my mind, but I was able to shake off the desire relatively easily. For a while anyway. \n\nEven thought the first time was only a handful years ago, it seems like a lifetime. A group of my peers was playing a \"using\" game and even with full knowledge of the dangers, I was attracted by the Austerity of it all. \"Just this one time\", I thought. \"It'll be different for me.\" \"I can control it\". These are the lies that I chanted to myself over and over. The first time was probably the best. The rush of emotion as it was entering my system and attacking my senses was indescribable. The firing of a trillion synapses all at once followed by a dopamine dump to rival the Niagara Falls. The dragon was exquisitely out of its lair. I used for an entire month without rest. It got to the point were I couldn't even tell I was using. No rush to the senses, only the icy chill of the after effects. I tried using more but just couldn't get to that same level. Others could obviously tell. It was impossible to hide. I'd hear the occasional comment or two, but most people just keep to themselves about this kind of thing.\n\nI don't recall how I was able to stop after that first month. It's all a blur. It would occasionally cross my mind but I was mostly able to shake off the cravings. I'll admit, there were a few times that I used again after that first binge, and for a while I thought I had tamed that fiery dragon. I could not have been more wrong. A year had passed since answering the first song of the Sirens. Could have been a year to the day for all I can recall. Things were seemingly normal. Life was manageable and I had absolutely no reason to pick up again. Sometimes we can only see our folly when viewed through the distorted rearview of time. I did it again. It was amazing again. The thrill was back and there was no stopping me this time. I hit it fast and hard and for a while I was rewarded with that same euphoria that hooked me the first time. BUT! As is the case with many gluttonous behaviors, the side effects began to set in. I went on another full month binge that would nearly cost my marriage, job, and reputation. \n\nFortunately, I was able to clean myself up again and go on the wagon for another year or so. Granted, the occasional slip up still crept in. This foe is cunning, baffling, and always at the ready to pounce on any moment's weakness. I'll spare you the gut-wrenching minutiae, but I will say that this cycle has been on repeat for a handful of years now. I've lost count. Fast forward to present day. Here I am on day four of what could be yet another bender. Didn't even make it a year this time. Maybe only nine or ten months. Can I control it? Doubtful. Will I survive this time? One never knows. Fortunately I have this outlet. This seems to be the only safe space I can talk about it. The only place where there are others like me that know the call. And others still that know who we are. We are the ones that forever tear though rationality. We are the ones that use for extended periods of time. We are the ones fascinated by the intensity.  We are the ones misunderstood by the masses. We are the ones to answer the Sirens' song. We are the Knights of Stag. \n\nHello, I'm Cosmo, and I'm a Stagaholic.\n\nEdit: Oh crap. Drug STORE day.

She talks about the horrors of her childhood through her eventual escape to San Diego and return to see what's left of her family in 1986. It's a crazy story that some might find difficult to read due to the content. Part of it could be my connection with Vietnam but I really enjoyed this book. \n\n*Phoenix - First Act* is another memoir, this time of an alcoholic German girl living in Brussels in the 80's during the time of the German Reunification.

When I walked in this morning I was hit with a wall of fragrance that instantly took me back to my childhood. \r\n\r\nI wanted to be a cool skater kid so badly. I tried to grow the long bangs to look the part but my curly hair just poofed up on the top of my head earning me the nickname &quot;Puffball&quot;. My parents, who also cut my hair, were not fans. The last time my dad cut my hair, I pleaded for him to leave the bangs. He did not. I was devastated. From that point on I would use my own money, paper route at the time, to go to the barbershop and get my hair cut the way I wanted. Walking in to the barbershop the first time was a life changing experience. The smell of the leather and wood from the chairs, the smoke of three decades of old men perusing adult magazines, and the gas of the 1974 Buick Electra 225, filled my senses with wonder and represented a new level of independence.

The scales or handle is the biggest difference between them all. The amount of blade exposure might vary slightly from one to the next but what really matters is that the sides are even on either side of the blade when it's closed. They're glorified blade holders and the weight is just a matter of preference. One isn't necessarily better than the other. It's a great razor for ten bucks but know that I was given mine by someone that cut themselves up with it and hated it. I started with shavettes and then went to straights but there's no reason why you can't just go directly to straight razors. You're probably more likely to cut yourself with a shavette than you are with a straight. Getting a good slick lather and learning how to adjust based on feedback are the most important things. Half assed lather works ok with a DE because the razor carries a bunch of water up with it. Not so much with a shavette and even less so with a straight. If you're determined, you'll get it.

I have thoughts.\r\n\r\nu/groomingdept saw I was testing out various pre-shave products and sent over a tub of his [Moisturizing Pre-Shave](https://www.groomingdept.com/collections/pre-shave/products/grooming-dept-moisturizing-pre-shave-bergamot-ginger) for me to try. It&#39;s bergamot ginger which smells very nice and reminds me of something that I can&#39;t seem place my nose on. It&#39;s a thick lotion or cream consistency that is massaged into damp skin and water can be added as necessary to get it into its most effective state. The lather can then go directly on top of it after a minute or so of massaging it in. It&#39;s very nice and some will probably prefer the consistency over an oil type product. I can see it being an enjoyable part of a full barber shave that includes the aspects of a facial treatment along with the shave. Today was my first use, and since I used a bunch of other new stuff, I&#39;ll have to use it a few more times before I can give a full opinion. My initial thoughts are that it&#39;s an excellent product and my post-shave skin feel is as smooth as I&#39;ve ever had it. I&#39;m very much looking forward to using it more and hopefully I get to do a face shave during my last week of barber school and can try it in that environment. \r\n\r\nOn to Mammoth \u798f (F\u00da D\u00c0O). This fragrance is wonderful to me and is full of all the stuff I love. I&#39;ve always said my favorite scents are citrus, incense, oud, and sandalwood and cedar. This isn&#39;t exactly that and it&#39;s not listed but something in there is giving me an incense vibe. It&#39;s very well done. I also have a special place in my heart for Lunar New Year and have celebrated both at home and in Vietnam so that plays into for me as well. I&#39;ve been mostly out of the new soap game but I went full blind D-hole based on the description and my respect for Ben as a perfumer. I only bought the EdP sample but I may end up going back for the bottle. The EdP and splash carry the fragrance best for me. The soap scent has a little background noise that is similar to what I was getting off of Mallard Fougere last week. Am I picking up the duck fat? Does that smell like anything? I&#39;m not sure. Regardless, this is easily one of the best soap bases out there and in constant contention for my all time favorite. \r\n\r\nThe shave was incredible. I had a few days growth and it came off as if it were done by depilatory. I think this is the first I&#39;ve used the Tusk base and it was so easy to build a shiny, goopy lather that had plenty of residual slickness. I believe the pre-shave also contributed to the slickness and the first-pass rinse left enough to go again as is. I was able to easily go against the grain on my lower lip which has always been a trouble area. Today it was just as easy as any other spot. This is my second time using a Dorco ST300 and I like them a ton. Don&#39;t even know where I got these blades. \r\n\r\nLong story long, today&#39;s shave was so good I already want to do it again.", "created_utc": "1645457693.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxuaxk8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxn6hf", "parent_id": "t3_sxn6hf", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Wetshaving", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb88"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "Good luck!", "created_utc": "1645394637.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hxr8g7o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_sxcjs8", "parent_id": "t3_sxcjs8", "score": "4", "subreddit": "wicked_edge", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s46m"}, {"author": "CosmoBarber", "body": "That\u2019s basically what I did except I couldn\u2019t find a spray foam that will fill up the spaces in the corners economically.

I should start taking notes and do a big write up on all these products, maybe a YouTube review, a series maybe. \r\n\r\nBaxter of California is a men&#39;s hair and skincare product company out of Los Angeles. I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of product names are &quot;Someone of Somewhere&quot; or &quot;Someone &amp; Someone&quot;. Makes them sound fancy. This is an 8oz  tub that seems to be out of stock everywhere I look online so I can&#39;t compare my price to the public&#39;s price and see if there&#39;s a difference.  I paid $13.04 for it. The long list of ingredients is pasted at the bottom. Sorry for yelling them, that&#39;s how I copied it.\r\n\r\nThe formula is soft, airy, and lumpy. It has a light fragrance that smells similar to hand lotion. The directions recommend applying with a badger brush but I just wet my skin and rubbed it in with my hands because I was lazy. The the lumps get worked out and the consistency becomes creamy but I left it at a pretty thin layer. It provides a serviceable amount of initial slickness and maintains its moisture long enough to get a complete pass in. There&#39;s not much residual slickness to speak of but it doesn&#39;t go tacky and become a detriment.

I was going to share it here but there was no thread last week and I forgot about it until just now..\n\nI finished Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (Full title, not my idea) by Mary Shelley. This is the 1818 version that was digitized by Project Gutenberg and formatted by Standard eBooks. I got it for free which is my favorite price. It wasn't the story and imagery I had in my head from TV, which is a more campy version of a clumsy and slow moving monster. It's a little bit of a difficult read due to the older style language but I kind of fell into the groove after a few minutes. I was really stoked on the Kindle being able to look words up instantly. (I also just used the translate function on another book, which is pretty awesome.) I thought the language was kind of cute or funny when she would write things like, ....while focused on the sickening task at hand. I don't know, it was always sickening or disgusting, hard to explain but I got a chuckle out of it.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOverall the story is great. It's presented from an interesting perspective of some third-party guy telling the story to his sister through letters as he was told by Victor Frankenstein. I enjoyed thinking about how this must have been a pretty intense read for people back then who had no exposure to a lot of stimuli the way we do now. Also amazing to think about how it was the idea of a young girl who was tasked with coming up with a ghost or horror story simply for entertainment purposes while stuck inside. Maybe that's just what a group of writers do when they have free time. Apparently they participate in other shenanigans as well since there may have been an affair between Shelley and Lord Byron, her host while visiting her future husband. Possibly even a baby. Scandalous! Anyway, I think we're supposed to be left wondering with whom to sympathize. Can't help but feel bad for the monster who may have been good had it not been for how he was treated by Victor and the general public he encountered. Maybe a nature / nurture kind of argument.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nLong story long, it was a great book. I was excited to get back to it in the evenings.

So far, the drugstore stuff has all been garbage. This time, a Google search for &quot;best barber shop shave gel&quot; pointed me to [EZ-Blade shave gel](https://www.ezbladeshavingproducts.com/collections/frontpage/products/16-oz-shave-gel). Lucky it&#39;s on Amazon with free next-day delivery. \r\n\r\nI treated it as I would with a client, minus the hot towel and steam machine. Just massaged some gel in and then went about cutting up a razor blade to load into the basic WCS Shavette which is my Genesis. The gel rinses easily with no oily residue. I applied a second almond size squirt to my damp face and went after it. The thing I like most is the stuff doesn&#39;t dry out quickly and doesn&#39;t seem to go tacky too quickly, if at all. I got a little bit of blade chatter but it worked pretty well. I&#39;ll apply it to towel dry skin next time to see if that helps minimize the chatter. The stuff has a mild eucalyptus smell which isn&#39;t offensive but a little too medicinal for my taste. It reminds me of the steam baths my wife makes. \r\n\r\nIt took me two passes to get to what would be an appropriate &quot;regular&quot; barber shave. There are actually different levels of barber shave. A once-over which is a holdout from the daily barber shaves of the 50&#39;s, a regular shave which is twice over as needed to get to smooth, and a close shave which goes against the grain on clients that can tolerate it. I got to smooth with zero irritation or nicks. I left my skin alone afterwards to see how the post shave felt and it wasn&#39;t drying. Feels pretty good actually. TTS was recommending Fougere Angelique and who am I to argue with that, so I put that on after a few minutes. No sting.\r\n\r\nNow my experimenting mind is wondering how this stuff would perform on skin that was treated with a pre-shave oil like Stirling has. Also wondering what a shave using just the pre-shave oil would be like. Probably too oily, need dry fingers to stretch the skin. I know one way to find out though. As I get more experience with shaving other people, I might get to a point where I mix up my own CosmoBarber Shave Gel. Maybe I can get some formulation tips from u/USS-SpongeBob and all the other experts around here.
