studying German for a couple of months so far and here is what i think\n\nVocabulary: is easy considering that its a Germanic language like English but obviously there is different word than English and ypu wont find them troublesome to memorize, what i find hard is separable and inseparable verbs there is just so many of them and some time they are confusing\n\nPronouncing : is a little bit different than English but one to two days and you'll be good to go\n\nGrammar : let me break the grammar part into many parts\n:Word Order: is very specific once you learn and practice it for some time it is gonna be easy but still quite different than English\n:Verbs: you only need two verb tenses and the perfect tense and present tense the present must be conjuncuated according to the subject but the perfect (past) tense you inly need two verbs conjuncuated and a specific rule for the past verb itself, obviously there are 4 more tenses but you dont need to worry unless you feel like mastering the language \n:Adjectives ending:this one is tricky and a lil bit hard to pick up on since there is 16 ways to end an adjective according to the noun \n:Cases: there are 4, they can get tricky because generally you need to mix a combo of the case and the gender to bring out an adjective for example, considering English has mostly lost its cases cases can take a time to be understood\n:Genders: 3, you mostly need to memorize each noun and its gender to know how to deal with it when speaking , some noun-endings charts can be helpful but theres also quite alot of these noun endings\n:Preposition: not hard but they need some practice since they are very different from English\n\nListening: listening is easier than other languages like Spanish or French and is somewhat easier than English since German speakers usually speak slowly\n\nin general german is not unthinkably hard but its not the easiest thing in the world I'd say 3-4 months and you are gonna be an advance intermediate if you put yourself to it good luck!", "created_utc": "1635376805.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hib977o", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qggkt7", "parent_id":
