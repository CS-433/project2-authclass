I can do lots of pull-ups, but just because someone can do more, doesn't mean I'm not strong or fit. \n\nDo lots of small things in life that make you feel assured to be who you are, and forget about what others think. \n\nEven the smallest things, like always being clean and showered, always wearing clean nice smelling clothes, and having a clean room and living environment. We can all do that, and believe me, it's a great base for confidence. \n\nThen you can exercise regularly. You don't have to be the strongest or have a magazine cover physique, but you CAN be strong and fit.\n\nWork hard to get good grades, or learn a trade, so you can make a decent income.
