Most likely there is a house or government building made by a famous architect if it\u2019s a city. So make a journey out of it! Get some snacks and go visit it together. You can talk to your kid about the colors, materials, and shapes. you don\u2019t have to be knowledgeable yourself. Just start off with some simple comments like, \u201clook how the wood is used here\u201d, \u201cthis shade of red is pretty\u201d \u201cthese colors complement each other\u201d, \u201cwhy do you think they built it like this?\u201d and then conversation and curiosity will spill from there.\n\nYou can buy cheap miniature house kits from hobby lobby or online. It comes with glue, furniture, wood, all that. Look up \u201cMayberry street hobby kit\u201d. Also Lego has architecture sets. \n\nYou can go on YouTube and look for popsicle stick house and furniture tutorials. It\u2019s fun because you feel like you are using real wood boards, but it\u2019s just popsicle sticks! \n\nHere\u2019s examples of [coloring books](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/b/books/coloring-books/architecture-coloring-books/_/N-29Z8q8Z2kv0)\n\nAnother fun thing would be to look at the architecture unique to different countries and cultures. Huts, pueblos, yurts, castles\u2026. Play a matching game, where you have a set of cards - their architecture to the countries flag. \n\nYou can also ask your kid to write a small essay about why that person lives in that type of house. Things like resources available, climate, cultural beliefs. Example\u2026 Japanese houses are made of light material, so they can let the air flow when it\u2019s humid. And their culture appreciates nature, so they don\u2019t want to feel separate from nature, and they use lots of sliding doors and lots of windows to see nature! \n\nAdd other media, like movies and books that incorporate architecture. Show something fun about homes being built. To make listening more active, you can ask some comprehension questions along the way. Kind of interview your kid after watching. IMPORTANT\u2026 make the student feel like he has something to tell YOU. Let them be the expert. \n\nAnd always remember - lots of praise! At the point you just want to support your learners curiosity. If you can kindle those flames you are already doing what you need to do. \n\nEven just alternating and building upon these ideas, I think you guys can have a lot of fun and learn many things together.

Public money was not poured into it because it is not considered to be Dallas. In the 60s people looking for job opportunities started to come out of this area, known to be mostly for farmers, and look for Dallas for job opportunities or college. The lake was built around this time and rockwall was not rich, it just had a lot of land. Being from tawakoni was considered more ghetto but tbh being from rockwall wasn\u2019t really that great either. Being by the lake wasn\u2019t a status symbol and the plots of land weren\u2019t  expensive back then. Rockwall was far from opportunity and Ray Hubbard was considered a dirty, bastard lake that was built improperly due to not removing the trees. \n\nThe city is not going to come in and buy every single plot of land to create a sidewalk around the lake at this point. It makes no sense to do so, unless there\u2019s a huge catalyst for something different. \n\nThey are developing public places nowadays, now that it\u2019s getting popular and attracting developers, but it\u2019s always been a place for farmers or lake rats looking for a cheap place to stay, and only more recently people with money who want to get away from Dallas. It\u2019s not a mysterious rich person land, though that is where they are trying to take it. Its just very, very young and not developed to inner city standard. It was literally nothing before this marina thing and bass pro came out about 10-15 years ago.

If you are convinced only \u201clame\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d people go to your CC, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t go.

And remember, you can always meet people in your city at clubs, bars, whatever hobby stuff your into so don\u2019t limit your socialization to just college.\n\nTLDR: CC can be great if you make it so. If you have huge doubts, or straight up don\u2019t want to go and think the cons outweigh the pros, then just don\u2019t go. Get a job, apply for a scholarship if you really want to go to uni.

It\u2019s a sad truth but it can be very hard for young people to be with one person, because lives, personalities, interests change so often. We are all on the planet trying to figure ourselves out. That being said, you shouldn\u2019t have experienced this so many times.\n\n2. You might need to have conversations with them more, from the beginning. State that for you to be happy in a relationship, you need to have a loyal partner, and that cheating is your #1 turn off. Tell them that if they feel the need to cheat, to break up with you first like a decent human being. It\u2019s very sexy when someone is upfront about what they want. An easy way to bring this up is to talk about turn offs with your partner then ease in to how cheating is scummy and gross and its something you judge people for. \n\n3. Your GFs may have felt like you were not possessive or gave them enough attention. Again I don\u2019t know you but as a girl the times I\u2019ve wanted to cheat were when my bf seemingly lost interest in me. He stopped wanting to have sex as much, stopped telling me I was his, and stopped texting me often. I was young and the only solution that I could think of was \u201cfind a guy who would give me attention while keeping my current bf because I like him as a friend\u201d. Now, I would break up instead of be shitty about it, but maybe your girls felt this..?\n\n\nBest of luck. No one deserves that kind of shitty treatment but such is life, hope it gets better.", "created_utc": "1651718868.0", "edited": "1651719082.0", "id": "i7dnfwe", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uimb5i", "parent_id": "t3_uimb5i", "score": "-1", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"author": "macaronist", "body": "Most certainly :)", "created_utc": "1651596444.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i76hsvl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ugw7p5", "parent_id": "t1_i764stf", "score": "2", "subreddit": "japanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmnp"}, {"author": "macaronist", "body": "We really need to try something.

But, people especially in their 20s now don\u2019t really want to fuck with that after marriage or during a relationship. cheating might still more acceptable than in other countries though.\n\nThis is going into further guess territory, but I think that many modern Japanese couples haven\u2019t been encouraged to talk about issues together like dead bedrooms, bad sex, or other relationship qualms. It\u2019s easier to find a person that can provide that than fix the problem with the main dude/chick.
