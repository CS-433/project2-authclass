I\u2019ve been in OW for over a year now, and played other FPSes on consoles and PC for the past 20 years. It already sucks enough to get a bronze rank telling you that despite your experience and time in the game, you are statistically considered one of the worst players in the world. Add to that the embarrassment of being labeled a \u201chealer one-trick\u201d because everyone else on your team insta-locks a DPS, and you achieve a perfect formula for \u201cwhy bother with this game and its community?\u201d attitude. \n\nI\u2019d like to improve. I practice whenever I can, track my performance, note my shortcomings, all because I\u2019d like to be a great player that\u2019s respected by my teammates and opponents alike. Smurfs, along with throwers and other problem players, make good practice nearly impossible. Unbalanced teams prevent players from sharpening their skills in realistic gameplay scenarios.\n\nLast season, I wound up healing and tanking my way up to mid-silver before a string of thrown matches dragged me back down to bronze. Now, I don\u2019t even know if I want to try Season 6, in anticipation of more disappointment and embarrassment as pick heroes that fill gaps in composition, and watch my effort go to waste as I attempt to \u201cclimb\u201d through unbalanced matches.\n", "created_utc": "1504459382.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dmiijmt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6xs3au", "parent_id": "t3_6xs3au", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl"}, {"author": "LeGrille90", "body": "\"I am the Angel of Death.
