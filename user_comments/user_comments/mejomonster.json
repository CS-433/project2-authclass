I thought I needed to go on dates right away just so I can start getting to know people, meanwhile I have a friend who talks with people for months over text before going on a date, so I guess they put some of that get to know each other part before even a first date. So I don't know. My crushes are rare enough that I still might not get a crush more than once a year or once every few years, since I do need to meet people And find out if I could grow attracted and that isn't going to line up perfectly to be people I'd crush on very often lol.

So whatever language you most want to do stuff in. What language do you want to read novels, chat on forums, talk to people, watch shows, listen to podcasts, play games etc in? What language will you use and be therefore motivated to keep studying until you can do what you want with it? That's going to be the easiest one for you. If you have nothing you want to do in a language, you may want to explore that first so you have some motivations later for when things feel difficult. \n\nAlso, doing a small amount of looking up what learning speaking, reading, writing, listening entails. Looking up what A1, A, B1, B2, C1 etc skills are so you can consider what your goals are. And looking into what goal setting and planning strategies will be helpful for you. If you're not taking a class then you'll have to do the goal planning and study plan making parts yourself to get better in speaking, reading, writing, listening to the amount you want to be able to do. For me, making a study plan that worked for me was the hardest part, not the actual language learning.\n\nIf you don't have a particular language in mind, you may also want to look at the hours FSI suggests different languages take to learn. A significant part of if you \"learn\" a language is if you study the amount of hours it will require. French is \"easier\" for an English speaker because it requires less study hours (so I saw myself improving in a shorter time frame). Chinese is \"harder\" for an English speaker because it requires more study hours to make progress (so if I studied the same amount per day as French I would expect it to take more days to reach my goals). If you think you don't have a lot of time to study, or don't want to study X years, then study hour recommendations might be worth looking into for you. (But if say you really wanted to watch kdramas without subtitles and visit the country, but will never watch French TV or read a French novel, it would probably still be more worthwhile to learn Korean even if it'd take more study hours).\n\nEdit: I did study Esperanto once for a single month and it was definitely super easy, I never used it again byt I did think the experience helped me notice what patterns in grammar might look like (since Esperanto is regular) which made later noticing patterns in other languages something I got better at looking for.", "created_utc": "1666468606.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itdd9t8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yasc38", "parent_id": "t3_yasc38", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I think it is worth seeking out some easier books, as the more you can extensively read (or just run into unknown words a manageable amount for you rather than non-stop to the point of really slowing speed) the more reading stamina you can build, and easier it will be to get through more reading material. In chinese I bounce between some easier stuff and some more challenging stuff, as reading both types benefits. With easier stuff you can read more sentences faster, therefore getting comfortable with grammar and the words you looked up faster (and figure out some words just from context). With harder stuff you can find more new unknown words faster so find new words to learn in bigger quantities, though you get less reading practice per session since you read slower.\n\nEasier materials may be: 1. Anything you've read before in a language you understood, because you will already know the story and therefore have context. Often Harry Potter is partly \"easier\" because if someone already read it in a language they understood, then they can use that context to guess unknown words and continue reading if they got confused at some part (since they already know the plot). So if you read say a Stephen King novel etc anything in a language you understood before, it will be easier to read in Portuguese than something brand new. 2. Material written for younger audiences. Harry Potter starts off aimed at 11 year old readers. So its vocabulary is less broad, writing style is less complex. The writing does get more complex and longer as the books go along (since each book seems aimed at the age Harry Potter is), so reading difficulty gradually progresses. So if you go for anything written for middle schoolers or a little younger/older, you'll find stuff that will likely be easier to read in Portuguese. That's what I did with Chinese, I found some novels aimed at 9-13 year olds as some of my easier reading material. That worked well as the vocabulary was more limited, grammar more straightforward, and length of novels shorter (so quicker to finish which was motivating). So you could look up any Portuguese translation of a book for that age group, or any Portuguese books aimed at that age group, and it will likely be on the easier end.", "created_utc": "1666467975.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itdblv6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yanlj6", "parent_id": "t3_yanlj6", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for these links and for explaining your study process!

Ones people are more likely to have seen: Word of Honor (excellently written, wuxia, on Netflix, youku, youtube, based on a novel by priest who also wrote Guardian),  Love Between Fairy and Devil (really new, Netflix and iqiyi, one of the best cgi I've seen in fantasy genre anything and really good costume/world concepts, also very solid story).", "created_utc": "1666365212.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it7p381", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y9cwsu", "parent_id": "t1_it61nj6", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for explaining!

Because I know as SOON as I can start reading in the language I can stay more motivated. For me, reading stuff in it's original language and wanting to read other stuff in the future that's more intricate just really tends to motivate me. So it gives me a goal to look forward to (and do in smaller-goal pieces) as I do the things I am less interested in studying.\n\nIn general though I think finding anything in the language you're learning that you enjoy would be equally motivating. And then finding a way to do some-of-that-thing-you-enjoy earlier on, even if not as well as you'd like, to do what you like sooner and regularly to keep you motivated. Part of that may be exploring, I found out by running into it that I liked japanese musical plays, which I could only find in japanese with no subs, and that's what finally motivated me to work on my listening skills. I knew before I started japanese I wanted to play games in their original language, so I tried every so often, and even when it would be hard or I'd play in english, it would remind me of my goal and kick me into wanting to study more again. Trying to get more motivated to learn to read novels in japanese, I've been looking for writers I really like so I've got a goal book I'll be really wanting to read to motivate me.\n\nAlso depending on your personality: challenges. I usually set short and longer term goals because goal structure keeps me focused on doing the X books read I set the goal of that month, or reading through Y chapters of textbook etc. But I find personal challenges pretty motivating too, especially the ones where I find what someone else did as a study plan and think to myself 'I want to test if this works for me/if I can get as good a result if I do it.' That's how I got myself to study 2000 words at the beginning of Chinese - I saw an article of a guy who studied them for 2 months (a very specific memrise deck) then dived right into reading webnovels using Pleco app. I wanted to read, so I figured I'd copy his plan and see if it would work for me too.  Or Listening Reading Method - I've never managed to do the intensity per week of the creator of the method, but when I found it I challenged myself to try it for several hours to test if it even worked, and in my case it worked phenomenally. I just did not have the stamina to do it as long as intended, but it was still beneficial. Recently I ran into an article about 92 books read to get reading fluency in a TL. Since seeing that, I felt motivated to try and see if reading a large chunk of books would improve my reading skills as much as the person in the article through their experience. I'm a long way from 92, but it did get me to read 300k characters in September which is a huge dent compared to the very little reading I did earlier in the year. I've finished 6 books recently which has shown significant reading improvements, which motivates me to keep trying the challenge longer and see if I keep making progress like the article writer did. So sometimes I feel like it's helpful to see what other people are doing to study, sometimes that gives ideas for stuff you can challenge yourself to do?

In english I see international, and when I was a child I might have interpreted the 'new' word as 'inter' (connected) nation (nations) so guessed this word has something to do with interacting nations. In english I see pieces of words or whole words I know the meaning of, then interpret new words based on that. I see hushe \u62a4\u58eb and see protect (hu) and shi (used with some professionals) so I guess it has to do with protecting-people-job (it means nurse). With some words this is very easy like steering wheel in english is clearly \"a wheel to steer vehicle\" and  \u65b9\u5411\u76d8 is literally direction-plate so also a wheel to steer a vehicle. With english sometimes I don't know what parts of a word hints, same with chinese. With english sometimes I don't know how to pronounce a new syllable and guess, same with chinese. Chinese hanzi often have a sound component so I can usually guess a pronunciation until I learn it properly later.\n\nWith japanese, it is mostly like english. Except I can sometimes guess meaning even if I have no clue at all what the kanji part of a word is pronounced as. Because if I know the kanji I can make a guess at the word's meaning. But I may not be able to guess the word's full pronunciation. \n\nI do read in my head, but I think I'm just a very audio focused person.

Japanese was the 'hardest' in that I also used to study .5 hours a day on average, and it took 2.5 years to get to just reading simple manga with a dictionary to look up words and grasp the overall main idea.

I used to find grammar hard too but I think it's just because it's so different from english, it was not intuitive to me for a long time.\n\nChinese was way easier than I expected it to be.

Personally, I think it's okay to transition to using hanzi With pinyin (like pinyin above) and still rely on the pinyin for a while, just because constantly seeing the hanzi at the same time may help the pronunciation eventually stick for you. When you start moving to hanzi only, I recommend listening to audio as you read, so you can hear the pronunciation of hanzi and again use that to help you use hanzi pronunciations. There's some graded readers with audio, reading graded readers (or anything) on something like Pleco app you could use the speaker-phone icon to hear everything read aloud, and there's some graded readers with pinyin above and a cover for the pinyin so you could practice reading with and without pinyin aid. I don't think its bad to keep using pinyin while you need it, I think I used it until I had studied like 2000 words (so maybe HSK 4ish). I do think that shifting to no longer relying on pinyin is not as hard as it may seem, the mind adjusts. Your mind knows ni3 and \u4f60 are both \"you\" in chinese, its just not recalling the 'ni3' pronunciation super fast when you see \u4f60 yet. (Not a great example but its this kind of idea). So if you only use the hanzi, your brain has the pronunciation info for that word it just has to practice remembering it when it sees the hanzi with that word meaning.\n\nI also would really recommend checking out this book, if you have a local library or belong to a college so you can use their library then this book is usually free as an ebook check-out.

So the question is: will you lose what you learned if you take a break, or can you come back after a break and get back whatever you forgot then return to studying where you left off?\n\nThe answer is yes. After a break, usually even if you forgot some stuff, you can review it and 'relearn' it way quicker than the first time around. Then move onto learning where you left off from before the break. So if you had to take a break, it's okay. Your prior efforts studying were still worthwhile, and if you pick up studying again later you can make further progress. All study time adds up, ultimately.\n\nIt may be worth keeping in mind though, the shorter the break the less you will get rusty on. And the more competent you were in the language, the less you will forget and need to review when you return to studying. For example: in chinese I took a 4 month break from studying (in year 2 able to read some stuff extensively and do some listening without word lookup) because I was busy and dealing with health issues. When I came back to studying, I needed a couple weeks for some vocabulary to come back, but by a month of returning to study I'd moved into studying new material again. In contrast, in Japanese I'd only learned maybe 1000 words and basic grammar, then taken a 1 year break. I had to do 2 months to review the basics again, then I could move onto new stuff.

I think shadowing, and doing it every few months so I could hear errors I was making in earlier months and correct it, helped a lot. On Hellotalk I had a few short conversations at month 5, but mostly didn't go off and speak a ton with people until month 8 or so once I'd done a lot of pronunciation shadowing and correction. The shadowing, and focusing on it again and again as I was able to notice more, I think helped more than the overall rarely having conversations. I don't think I would've fossilized bad pronunciation if I'd spoken more (but maybe I would've lol), since I was aware mentally \"I'm probably not saying this right\" so I didn't assume how I said things was correct when chatting.\n\nConversely in French I didn't speak for 2 years. My speaking sucked when I started, real bad in my opinion. I wish in retrospect I had done both more pronunciation Studying (listening to sounds, examples, carefully and every few months, with a guide and explanations for sounds I couldn't 'hear' well), and done more shadowing every few months (to emulate correct pronunciation and notice over time what mistakes I made as my listening improved and I could hear more and more mistakes). Instead, I had to start that whole process after year 2 ToT. However, I think a silent period could work Much Better Than Mine did if a person does listening study, pronunciation study, earlier and more regularly than I did.

So accounting for that helped my symptoms a lot. My doctor noticed I had worse fatigue the lower my blood pressure was. And electrolytes/sodium seemed to help lower my symptom severity. So he ordered me compression stockings (which I wore for a couple months until the symptoms improved), these took my heart rate down 20 points. He ordered me sodium tablets, told me to take 1-2 g a day, up to 6 g a day as needed, since it would up my blood pressure a bit and therefore lower symptoms. First month I took it daily 1-2 g a day, now I only take sodium on days I feel dizzy or fatigued. I also got Saltsticks Electroytle tablets, which I chew if dizzy - I had 2-4 a day first couple months, now like the sodium I only take if flushed/dizzy which is maybe a couple times a month. In the initial months, with compression stockings lowering heart rate a bit, sodium and electrolytes daily to help minimize fatigue and dizziness, I started a POTS exercise protocol I found on http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=36 . I started with only the strength training exercises, did for about 2 months (1 session every few days to the amount of reps I was able to), then I added \"HIIT\" but since my heart rate was so I high I just did moderate walking and then slow walking. The protocol suggests sitting/reclining exercise first but that wasn't available to me. About 3 months in I could stop wearing compression tights, my heart rate was 20 bpm less just from the improvements from the POTS exercises. I continued and my heart rate got down to 75-100 bpm sitting, 85-110 standing, 120-140 bpm exercise (usually 130 walking). This has made me feel much better, and usually when I have a bad day where I feel dizzy I just can take Saltsticks electrolytes tablets or a sodium tablet and feel better. I was able to stop the regular POTS exercises and go back to taking regular walks in the neighborhood. I still do strength training from the POTS exercises I found a couple times a week, since it helps muscles strengthen so tachycardia doesn't go up so much when I move to stand. I have maybe 1-3 dizzy days a month, which are very easy to mitigate. I don't feel I have to think about POTS symptoms much anymore. I do not think what worked for me would work this well for another, and another may need a totally different approach. I got very lucky that once I suggested it might be POTS, my general doctor tested for it, suggested the sodium and POTS exercises for it, and noticed it was worse when my blood pressure was lower. Mine seems to be tied with low blood pressure. On my own I floundered for 5 months before I suggested POTS to my doctor and he looked into it, then I was feeling close to normal again within 3 months of working on it.\n\nEdit: my roommate also developed tachycardia post covid. For him, calcium blockers have been helpful in lowering symptoms severity. My doctor tried beta blockers on me, but it lowered my blood pressure more and I fainted more/felt even more fatigued, so it wasn't helpful for me.", "created_utc": "1665505718.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irwnx85", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y1215c", "parent_id": "t3_y1215c", "score": "1", "subreddit": "covidlonghaulers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wizt3"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I can link what I used. I did some initial basic study of tones like most people do, just reading the examples learning materials give. I didn't fully grasp it, but I felt I heard examples learning materials used where it was like \"1st tone sounds even, 2nd tone sounds a bit like a drop then rise, 3rd tone sounds like questioning in English 'mom?(rising in question) you there?', 4th tone sounds like when in English we say angrily or firmly 'no!'.\n\nHowever, actually hearing it much better took that beginning few weeks of information, then 5 months in I did a month of studying pronunciation more and improved a lot. If you're beginning, go easy on yourself as I think to a degree sometimes it's hard to notice some parts until you have more exposure. \n\nThings I used:\n\n1. Went through this free dongchinese Pinyin guide section entirely. Helped with hearing specific initials, finals, tones, and has a test at the end to practice listening and giving your answer for what you hear. That test at the end felt helpful for practicing hearing the tone differences. I'd recommend going through the single tone trainer, and tone pair trainer a lot, until you feel quite comfortable hearing the tone pairs, then come back in a few months and see if your tone pair recognition improved.  https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin for the pronunciation guide, and https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/toneTrainer for the tone trainer. \n\n2. Grace Mandarin Chinese. I'm linking her tones video, but I find all her pronunciation videos helpful: https://youtu.be/n_Cj3aOSI1w and her video on when tones change: https://youtu.be/vl0eHgPP8Ms\n\n3. Rita Mandarin Chinese, her tones video. I think this is a good basic tones intro, goes into how the tones compare to certain tones in english we already use, also covers how in real life you don't always hear a full dip then upward sound in 3rd tone except for emphasis or certain words: https://youtu.be/gzKg2Rb8qvc\n\n4. These 2 tone videos were my favorites, I saved them. They go into tone sandhi changes (explaining why sometimes 3rd tone becomes 2nd tone etc, so you're right if you think you hear 2nd tone sometimes when you were told some hanzi was 3rd tone). https://youtu.be/dTOLpRWm6d4 and https://youtu.be/kjXriQALpT4\n\n5. I used the app \u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u5b66\u4e60, it may not be available on Android as I switched phones and need to find it again. The app is in all Chinese so I'd recommend waiting until you have some reading ability, it's relatively simple to navigate though even with just some basic hanzi knowledge. I used it 5+ months in and felt it worked better since I had some basic listening skills, I think my pronunciation was initially too atrocious before 5 months for me to have made much progress with this. There's a lot of free exercises (and paid but I only used it free), where you hear audio then record yourself saying it, then the app grades you on pronunciation. This helps with improving listening skills and speaking skills. There's another free app, simply called Chinese Pronunciation Trainer, it has a red icon with gold \u6587 on it. It does not grade your pronunciation unfortunately, but it does have audio you can listen to and shadow by recording yourself saying the same lines, then plays your audio compared to the example audio so you can listen and notice if you need to correct any pronunciation errors. This is the app I have on my current phone. \n\nLastly, a few textbooks have much better written explanations for tones than a lot of beginner materials that try to look unintimidating. I personally found Speak Chinese by Gardner Tewksbury to have a simple visual guide, I think the book was on archive.org, I linked the screenshot explanation here: https://rigelmejo.tumblr.com/post/620557034955358208/ and then First Step - An Elementary Reader for Modern Chinese had a good tone explanation, I put the screenshots here: https://rigelmejo.tumblr.com/post/620544669405888512/ if you have a local library or a college library, or feel like browsing archive.org, I feel like sometimes a textbook has explanations that seem to be helpful. \n\nMostly, for me, it was a matter of reading up and watching videos on how tones work, and a lot of listening and practicing seeing if I heard correctly or not. It took several months before I felt I was reliably recognizing the correct tones.

I got covid before the vaccines, and even now I am still doing so much worse than I used to be... I only this summer am finally able to sit up 4+ hours without fainting, go for walks again without fainting, and eat most days without vomiting. I got covid again this August, and I think for me vaccines helped immensely. This time getting covid, post vaccines, I had a slight sore throat and stuffy nose so I took allergy and cold meds not sure which I had lol, and was still energetic and doing lots those days, and recovered within a few days. My parents also caught covid again at the time in August (likely from me since I was visiting them a lot right before we all got sick). And like me, they had just a slightly sore throat and stuffy nose for a few days, no tiredness and quick recovery. Also, after this recent covid, I didn't have any lingering symptoms. Whereas after my first time having covid, i still have the lasting damage I'm still very slowly managing to improve. I do personally think also, taking allergy meds during this recent covid bout may have helped, but that's cause I personally think antihistamines seemed to help my long covid symptoms slightly, so I suspect it also helped my recent covid symptoms to be as minimal as they were. \n\nThis September I got the newest Pfizer booster, since I think for me the benefit seems to outweigh potentially re-triggering symptoms.

Look up pronunciation guide (usually a free website with audio, maybe some listening comparisons, maybe some additional YouTube videos). Go through it in a few weeks/month, trying to notice the specific sounds of the language. \n\n2. Same time as 1, look up information about the writing system. If it's significantly different like hanzi and Kanji, this may take a few months to several. First I just look up info on how the writing system works (for chinese this was learning about radicals and sound/meaning components, for Japanese this was learning radicals in Kanji and there's potentially multiple pronunciations and there's hiragana for word endings/some words/particles and there's katakana for foreign words, for French this was learning about the accent marks). I'll read a broad overview of how it works in a couple weeks. Then if it's a vastly different system like chinese hanzi, I start reading books with mnemonics to help remember hanzi (I used Tuttles Chinese Characters 800 book) and possibly some anki or memrise decks if it's got mnemonics. This part may take a few to several months.\n\n3. Within a month, find a grammar guide summary (could be free website or book I like) and read through it just trying to understand the explanations as much as I can but not memorize. I read within a few weeks (so by month 2 this is usually done). I do this so I know vaguely what grammar I'll run into in the language, and so if I get confused later I'll have an idea of what grammar points to look up for more information.\n\n4. Once I have a decent amount of writing system grasped (for chinese this was after studying 500 hanzi), so a few months in, start trying to get familiar with 1000 most common words. I've used a website word list with sentences and audio for French, memrise nukemarine decks and clozemaster for Japanese, Ben Whatley memrise decks and Chinese spoonfed anki decks for chinese. Get through it in 1-2 months focusing on studying new words over review if I'm crunched on time. Review optional, if I have time. I personally like memrise best. \n\n5. Maybe around month 6, start trying to read graded readers. Start trying to watch shows with a handful of word lookups in Google translate (or any translator) as I watch or less, with a goal of at least comprehending the main idea. Maybe try simple comics. Graded readers and their accompanying audio are where I finish learning a lot of those 1000 common words, since the graded readers reinforce them and basic grammar. \n\n6. Continue onto the next 1000 most common words, focusing on studying new over reviews if I don't have much time. Usually takes a month or a few. As I do this continue with shows, graded readers/audio, comics. \n\n7. 6 months to a year in (depends on language and difficulty etc), move into trying to read novels. Use a click dictionary tool sometimes (most eReader apps have this free/Idiom app/Pleco for chinese/Language Crush/Readibu/google translate has it on my phone etc), and other times just try to extensively read. As I get better at that, sometimes listen to audiobook with text. Also start listening to audio lessons/flashcards/podcasts if listening is weaker (so english/TL sentences audio or lessons or comprehensible input audio like from YouTube channels etc). Relisten to audio of novels I've read. More shows without, video games, anything in the language I like. Again sometimes looking unknown words up, sometimes just trying to guess from context. \n\n8. Get onto a language exchange app whenever I want (usually I do around 6 months in), go through pronunciation guides again with a better listening ear this time, then try to go chat with people. Look up words I want to say often when I dont know them, translate words I don't understand often. Repeat as desired every few months. I also like to shadow audio (try to say it as I hear it as closely as I can) to improve pronunciation, there's some chinese apps I used that would record my attempt and compare with chinese audio, which helped me improve a lot. Every so often pick something extra challenging for a while before going back to something that feels more easily doable, this tends to keep my basic comprehension level increasing over time. Except for listening materials, try to at least half the time find content with new words/stuff so I'm regularly learning new things instead of stalling. \n\n9. Continue. That plan works pretty well for me ToT. For production improvement I ultimately plan to also do written sentences based on grammar points by reading through a grammar guide again, and ultimately tutors so they can correct my speaking errors. When I chat in language exchanges people tend to want to practice rather than correct, which is good for practice but I'd like eventually to do a tutor so I can hone in on mistakes. \n\nFor timeline: French went quite fast and I had a worse study plan than this, Chinese went at about this timeline, japanese went eons slower until year 2 when I switched to a study plan more like this. If I was going to start a new language (oh Italian one day ToT) what I'd do differently is after reading a grammar guide summary and basic pronunciation guide, then just go through a comprehensible input textbook (Italians got one) and read and listen asap for basic grammar, common word vocabulary, grading reading practice, graded listening study. So that I could skip word lists/srs flashcards.

Glossika's old language audio files would be great for this: you'd just listen to them in the background during work, maybe a couple times each in case you want to relisten and catch what you missed, then move onto the next files. Audio lessons, with some relistening to help with more practice and with catching more since you won't be paying full attention, works great. \n\nAlternatives: look up your target language and \"audio lessons\" or \"learning podcast\" or \"audio flashcards.\" If you were learning Japanese, japaneseaudiolessons.com have free audio file lessons and would work perfect, for chinese \"chinese spoonfed anki audio\" files work great. I've used both of those and I improved a lot, even just listening mainly in the background as I worked or walked or drove or did grinding in video games etc. I'd listen to one file, move onto the next etc, then a few days later relisten to some of the files I'd already gone through for review. For a good foundation, Language Transfer website has good beginner introductions for free for some languages (Spanish, German, Italian, Greek, etc), Coffee Break podcasts have free good language introductions (I've used Coffee Break French). Ayan Academy on youtube has a lot of \"comprehensible input\" textbooks uploaded as videos with audio, and so the audio should be somewhat comprehensible if you wanted to use that as listening material. Just looking up on youtube \"1000 sentences with audio target-language\" will give you a lot of videos with TL/English audio sentences, which is all you need to use something as an audio lesson you'll understand (since it includes English for understanding and TL for learning).\n\nIf difficulty isn't a factor for you, you could genuinely use anything with english/TL audio sentences for lesson material. You could used Clozemaster apps Radio Mode and just listen a lot, find anki decks with english/TL audio sentences and just use it as audio files (for some languages people have already made free audio file collections like this). \n\nThe easiest route for listening only language learning might be: 1. Listen to an introductory audio lesson course like Coffee Break or Language Transfer (free options), or Pimsleur (paid). 2. Continue with audio sentence files in TL/english (free options include Clozemaster radio mode, audio files people have shared for your specific TL so Google this (anki audio, lessons websites etc), youtube sentences videos, youtube comprehensible input videos, youtube languagepod101 videos), old Glossika audio would work excellent for this, Textbook audio files may work well (like Teach Yourself, Assimil). 3. Once you've gotten through a lot of material (maybe 2000+ sentences or words), you may start finding some entirely TL audio to be something you can learn from. Good options for listening at this point would be: youtube comprehensible input videos, \"simple TL\" youtube videos, graded reader audio (sometimes posted on youtube or available elsewhere like Bilinguis site has some, Wasabi Japanese has some etc), learner podcasts entirely in the TL, \"slow TL\" audios like \"Slow French News\" etc. As that gets easier, 4. Listen to whatever you want, you can probably handle easier TL shows/movies at that point, vloggers, easier TL audiobooks possibly. So you'd transition to more materials made for native speakers.\n\nListening only study wouldn't really address reading, speaking, or writing skills. So you'd have to work on those eventually later if you want to. But you can learn a decent amount from listening-only resources. Ways to squeeze listening study material in when you can focus more: when walking, exercising, cleaning, driving, commuting, doing grinding in video games. Relistening 2-5 times (or way more) is incredibly useful even if you feel like you're not paying attention much, so relistening can be put into a schedule even when you think you might not retain much.

Find a website with audio and/or YouTube videos and podcasts and listen to the pronunciation nuances of the new language. For me, because I had a very fuzzy mental sound model for Spanish and my French mental sound model was more thorough, I'd see similar romance language words and automatically fall to relying on my French pronunciation/sound expectations. Once I'd listened to about a month of Spanish specifically (went through some pronunciation guide site and listened to learner podcasts) then I got a better mental sound for what Spanish pronunciation is.

I am glad in a way there are language learning people on youtube. When I saw Steve Kaufmans videos I was trying to learn French, and seeing he had a similar study plan to mine I felt like okay I will eventually make progress, and felt more confident my study plan was okay. When I found Matt v. Japan, while I didn't agree with all his ideas, I appreciated the links to study tools like the program to condense audio, the interviews with other learners so I could compare my study plan to different learners and see \"okay people more perfectionist than me made projects, but also people who did less review than me made progress, so my plan should be good enough to succeed.\" One particular person I watched had great suggestions for ways to study with reading, another had a free memrise courses which were very good and helped me get to intermediate. There's a channel who did a \"learn Italian in a month\" and no she didn't learn in a week, but she did make a very good starting study plan and was able to push into conversations and reading with word lookup at the end of that month, with a study plan similar to my 6 month ones, so I found it useful for getting activity/study material ideas. Another person did a \"speak French in a month\" video where I think he had reading basis, and just really focused on tutoring sessions and producing his own writings and speaking presentations for 5-8 hours a day, and he did make progress, and most useful to learners he gave examples of various activities that one can do for production skills when self studying. \n\nSo for every annoying polyglot who claims to speak 8 languages and markets pimsleur for the sponsorship and markets their own overpriced apps, there's still other videos I find with some good study plan ideas and some good examples of how people progressed so I can learn from their successes and mistakes and apply it to my own study plan. Theres some chinese speaking polyglot who's not that good, but he ended up leading me to some learners who did have good solid progress and them sharing their study activities/materials. There's Steven Kaufman who gets repetitive, but he did lead me to learning about studying by reading and studying with comprehensible input, which led to finding very useful study ideas I never would've thought about otherwise. So it's a mixed bag for me. Ultimately I'm glad I find them. But yeah, there's a lot who promise this ideal fluency when in reality it's beginner level tourism you too could cram quickly, and then the crashing reality that being able to do a lot in a language just takes A Lot of Study Hours.

So I'm trying to work up to being able to read 300k characters in a week, because webnovels can be So Long and I want to be able to read at a pace where I could actually finish one in a couple weeks. Right now I'm managing about 100k characters read in a week. I'm partly referencing Heavenly Path's site reading suggestions, partly using Readibu's statistics on difficulty and zhtool site's difficulty tool, and trying to read stuff progressively a little challenging but still easy enough to read extensively after some story specific word lookups in the first few chapters. I'm doing partly reading with lookups in Readibu, partly extensive reading, and partly extensive reading while following along with audio so I'll try to read faster/learn the pronunciations of things. So far it's going great! The listening stuff I do is helping a lot with remembering word pronunciations and I've got a lot stronger of a \"mental voice\" when reading now. Also the decision to go back to reading \"easier\" stuff instead of intensively reading harder stuff has actually helped my reading level so much. I started this reading kick in September, and there's so many webnovels right now that were too difficult to extensively read when I started, which are now doable. I only thought to try out \"easier\" stuff because someone mentioned I had a weak spot with \"easier\" writing that had less descriptions, but it turned out working on reading the \"easier\" stuff also helped make the harder stuff less difficult. \n\nI really want to find out myself if that \"read 92 books to get reading fluency\" idea is true. I know I'm not going to get anywhere close to that this autumn but I want to put a dent toward that goal lol. (And ideally get my reading level high enough to read some goal webnovels of 300k+ lengths fast enough they take weeks instead of months to finish).\n\nFor japanese: I'm listening through the old glossika sentences audio, and sometimes Clozemaster radio mode. I have some Kanji recognition I lean on when reading currently, so my weaker skill with japanese right now is just remembering pronunciations of a lot of words. I'm trying to focus heavily on audio to fix that, as this same study plan helped improve this a little back in the spring. I'm also, when I feel like it, playing Yakuza Ishin. It's all in Japanese and I'm very hype an English translation is going to be released soon! But yeah, playing japanese games or watching japanese let's plays is helping with the whole \"connect proper pronunciations to words\" situation. I'm also just playing the yakuza games (with English subs), which barely counts but I do think hearing all the japanese audio helps me again reinforce pronunciations of words I know. Later, when my audio recognition of words I know is better, I want to ultimately shift from these audio lessons into: 1. Starting to read some of the ebooks I got on my Kindle app more, and just trying to read novels specifically more, maybe starting with my \"Read Japanese\" tuttle book I have 2. Playing more video games in Japanese (as always lol), 3. Reviewing and possibly finishing Nukemarines LLJ memrise decks as they've helped me so much in the past I'd like to finish them. \n\nFor french: nothing right now ToT. When I have reason to get back into French, I plan to first go through Ayan Academy's Le Francais Par Le Methode Nature just listening to the audio, because listening is my weaker skill and I want to drill it.

If you comprehend the main idea and many details, it will be a faster/easier read for you and build up your reading stamina, reading speed, be vocabulary reinforcement, and let you pick up the unknown words fairly easily from context. Graded Readers are best for this kind of extended reading early on aw a beginner, like Mandarin Companion books, Pleco Graded Readers, du chinese site, etc. People find stuff the comprehend 98% or more to be most enjoyable to extensively read, but I've found it can be done at a bit lower comprehension as long as you can 1. Tolerate the ambiguity 2. Still grasp the main overall idea. \n\nIf you already comprehend the main idea or Almost comprehend it, but still can't figure out many individual details, you could decide to look up a handful of words each page/chapter that seem important. So that you can look up some words and increase comprehension but still read at a decent pace. So this would be some word lookup but trying not to stop at every single unknown word.\n\nWith any reading material, you can also intensively read (look up every single unknown word). This is good for increasing vocabulary, but can feel draining sometimes if done for long periods of time. You can learn more words from a more difficult text doing this, but if intensive reading feels Too Draining consider something slightly easier so your word-lookup amount and comprehension is bearable to you. Usually stuff comprehended at 90% or more is good for intensive reading, but it can be done with texts comprehended less it will just mean more unknown words.\n\nI personally do a lot of 1 and 2. I extensively read stuff at or a little challenging for me, and then switch to intensively reading something moderately challenging to me (so about a handful of word lookups per page/chapter). Going back and forth I've been able to gradually handle more challenging stuff, and extensive reading helps so much with vocabulary recognition and reading skills in general. \n\nI also think Listening Reading Method is a cool way to study with reading! I've done it a few times and it feels a bit like intensive reading (with figuring out each word meaning of everything) but is also a bit easier since you move at the pace of audio. And the Listening component means it's helps my listening ability a lot, not just my vocabulary and reading speed. (You can look Listening Reading Method up but the super short summary is Step 1 optional: read or be familiar with a text in a language you know, Step 2: listen to TL audio while following along with TL text noticing word boundaries and sounds and comprehending anything you're able to, Step 3: listen to TL audio while referencing translated text in a language you understand and attempt to understand what the TL audio means as in which word/phrase means what. If done correctly Step 3 feels a bit intense since it's not just tuning out and reading the translated text, it's focusing on trying to comprehend the TL audio. Then continue Step 2/3 repeatedly until you have comprehended as much as you can fully in the TL audio, possibly listening to only the TL audio to check your comprehension and also repeatedly listening as desired.

Some people will just make a few flashcards per day (like 5-20) and only spend maybe 30 minutes or less on flashcard study, so they still spend most time reading instead of on flashcards.\n\nFlashcard making is is also a nice strategy for when you want to read something very difficult to study a bunch of new words, but don't initially read very much of that difficult thing (like reading 5 pages of a book way above your ability and making flashcards, so you can study the flashcards and come back with a significantly better ability to try to read it). \n\nFor me: I'd just look up the word and move on. You will learn the words this way. Reading is kind of naturally reviewing what you learned (looked up) because you run into that unknown word again regularly until you remember it (learn it). I read somewhere most words are learned within 12 times of encountering it. So I tend to assume worst case I'm going to look up new words that many times. Mostly, I only need to look up a new word 1-4 times until I remember it. If you're reading more than a little bit, you'll run into the new words enough to learn them. You will make progress and learn the words without flashcards, if you feel like making them.\n\nEdit: it's like you said, we learned our native language just reading and maybe looking up a word and moving on.

For me chinese was drastically easier than japanese, grammar being less different than im used to thinking in (and no conjugation) and hanzi usually having one pronunciation instead of several. I studied Japanese 2.5 years with most progress happening in year 2-2.5, then stopped. I switched to Chinese and was reading manhua and novels and watching shows within a year, now 3 years in working on audiobooks too and bigger reading level now. \n\nI went back to studying japanese after 1 year of chinese. I noticed reading skill was way better, there's a lot of \"near cognate\" rough Kanji meanings to hanzi meanings. And even when a Kanji has a new meaning, it usually looks like a hanzi I already know. And totally new Kanji I'm just better at breaking down into radicals I can remember so Kanji recognition in reading is much better. When I left japanese 2.5 years into study I could read simple manga with a dictionary and just barely grasp the main idea. When I came back to japanese I could read all the manga I had for main idea without a dictionary, so I focused my studies on grammar and listenjng skills when I came back to studying japanese (which helped a lot). My weakest skill is Kanji pronunciations... I just find it really difficult to remember multiple pronunciations depending on the word. I think it will just take a lot of drilling. Whereas with chinese, many hanzi have sound components so new hanzi I can roughly guess the pinyin (letters to look up by pronunciation) when I see many new hanzi. I can quickly look up a hanzi if I see a possible sound component (certain radicals) and make a guess at broad meaning if it has a meaning component (certain radicals), learn the tone and meaning when I look it up (or guess meaning from context and learn sound from audiobook or show audio), then move on. With japanese Kanji, I must hear a sound and associate it with a new word which has X Kanji and X conjugations. Then see the Kanji again, and learn a potentially new pronunciation with possibly new hiragana word endings. So there's a lot more I can't guess with kanji and figure out quickly, and for some reason one sound=one symbol (hanzi) just sticks quicker in my mind. That definitely varies with people. I didn't realize audio helped me remember so much until I realized learning hanzi with audio helped me remember meaning/pronunciation better than just reading. So now, I focus on audio with japanese materials when I can since the audio of the Word will help me remember new japanese words Kanji and hiragana endings. \n\nFor your question of if you should study them together or apart: maybe try apart for a while since you're doing it together right now? Then see which works better for you. Hanzi and Kanji aren't always the same so they can't necessarily be studied in one big block together, and they \"work\" very differently. Hanzi are usually one pronunciation (or a couple very similar pronunciations like ti/di, di/de), have no word endings/conjugations (mostly*), and often contain a sound and meaning component. Kanji have a few pronunciations (on and kun), sometimes have word endings or conjugation attached, and im not sure if the \"sound\" component got transfered over into Kanji or changed to a new system but it doesn't work identical to the hanzi system (I haven't looked into a sound component system in Kanji much but I'd like to now that I'm thinking about it). The kanji on pronunciations aren't from modern mandarin and were adjusted to japanese pronunciation system, so they aren't always particularly close to modern hanzi pronunciations. So you'll be learning hanzi pronunciation, Kanji on and kun pronunciations.\n\nFor me, it is easier for me to keep them separate when I learn hanzi as part of chinese Words I study (since chinese words are often 2 hanzi I only studied individual hanzi for the first 500 hanzi for some base), and I try to learn Kanji as part of words they're in (since their pronunciation heavily depends on the given word). So for me it seems easier to study each writing system within my separate vocabulary study. For you, if knowing all possible pronunciations first is helpful then it may work better to study hanzi and Kanji at once. If you don't have a solid basic listenjng foundation, maybe go through a pronunciation guide in chinese. Just because it can be helpful to hear how distinctly didferent chinese pronunciation is from japanese, when keeping hanzi and Kanji separate in your head. Jikan \u6642\u9593 time in japanese, and shijian \u65f6\u95f4 sound very different if you're used to the pronunciation differences.. but ji and shi may be harder to distinguish if not used to hearing the difference. If audio helps you learn, hearing a different mental pronunciation for each language helps keep the Kanji and hanzi meanings/pronunciations separate. For grammar: definitely study each language separately. Their grammar is so different.

And that pattern kept happening of reading then stopping then read and it seems easier. Until I read as good as I wanted to. I'm now working on Chinese and the same process happens but quicker since I study more regularly. In chinese, I don't necessarily notice the breaks helping (but i still seem \"somehow\" better each time I take a break and come back anyway). \n\nI do have some theories about what might be happening. When we work on a skill, there's the \"easy\" feeling initial part where we feel WOW! We could understand the main gist! Then we keep doing the skill and realize how Much we still do not know as we get good enough to finally Notice things we still don't know. Then it feels very \"hard\" as we now notice a LOT we still don't understand. Then eventually we improve and we feel it's \"easy\" because we now understand some of those things we didn't before and feel accomplished that it's easy to grasp now. Then the cycle repeats and feels \"hard\" as we notice new unknowns. So its possible you were in a \"I notice SO much I don't understand so this is hard\" phase with your listening and were in the middle of learning that hard stuff. So you came back with it \"learned\" from that prior effort, so now it feels easier again.\n\nSomewhat similar to above: also when we study with something significantly above our comfort level, then afterwards we go back to something that used to be \"slightly challenging\" we notice it's no longer challenging. Our comfort level has increased slightly. So its also possible you were listening to some really challenging material which felt difficult, learned a lot from it, then found the news that would've only been \"slightly challenging\" before, so now it was very comprehensible. \n\nAlso yeah, we also just seem to have things \"click\" after a break.

I've been constipated less (with the help of my medicine too - so it's helping the medicine work better) since I started having a couple tea or tablespoons of honey a day. I also notice less days with just that awful painful pressure pain in my abdomen (though I'm still getting them some days). I tried honey in the winter and it did nothing, so it's worth trying some stuff that didn't work months ago to see if it may work now. I took ginger caps for a while in spring and felt they helped for a while, they help motility and nausea.

Now I am mostly under 100 bpm unless walking or doing strenuous activity, and now 120-130 bpm when walking which is way better than the 160 bpm+ I was at for standing or walking slowly at beginning of year.

I did a very minimal version of the POTS exercise protocol where I did the sets for leg and ab exercises, then for HIIT I did not do it at all to start, and when I got to it I just did walking since my heart rate was jumping so high from walking anyway. If people have access to support, usually sitting/reclining exercises are done first to keep from getting dizzy or too exhausted. But I had nothing to do sitting exercises with. I was not as diligent as the protocol, I would mainly only do the bodyweight leg and ab exercises every other day, at first less than that until I could handle once every other day.

I had a very low blood pressure though, so my doctors weren't sure if the super low BP was increasing the POTS symptoms, hence a lot of focus on add salt (up blood pressure) and build leg and abdomen muscles to keep BP from dropping when standing.

The first 3 steps boil down to building up a vocabulary and grammar understanding for reading and listening, and the other steps further focus on shadowing audio (speaking) and some writing. I do some L R Method when I can, it boosts my vocabulary listening and reading ability by a lot every time I've got 10 hours I can put into it. Step 1 (optional): read a book in a language you understand. Step 2: listen to TL audio as you follow along with TL text noting pronunciation and word boundaries, and comprehending whatever you can. Step 3: listen to TL audio and follow along with translation in a language you understand, trying hard to comprehend the audio you're listening to and figure out which word/phrase/sentence means what (it should feel like it requires intense focus if you're doing it right, should not feel as easy as watching a show with subtitles in english). Continue doing step 2 and 3 as long as you're learning more each time, then move onto the next chapter/book etc when you feel you've gotten what you want out of the current material. Additional optional steps: re-listening to TL audio on its own several times, sometimes with TL or translation text and sometimes not, until you can fully comprehend the audio with no text to aid you (I've only done the re-listening a little, not enough to fully comprehend audio on its own).  Re-listening to audio and attempting to speak along with the audio, to shadow it, to work on some speaking ability. Listening to the audio and attempting to transcribe what you hear, to work on writing/listening (I've never done this step).\n\nTwo much more common things you can do with reading: intensive reading and extensive reading. Both are really good and beneficial. Intensive reading helps you learn a lot of new vocabulary quickly, extensive reading helps build up your ability to read in the target language smoothly and quickly. \n\nGood intensive reading materials are anything you comprehend less than 95% of (so any reading material you find challenging to read without a dictionary). The more difficult the reading material, the more new words you can learn from it, but don't burn yourself out. Intensive reading is reading while looking every unknown word up with a dictionary/translator. \n\nGood extensive reading materials are anything you can follow the main idea of without looking words up, and ideally you can also follow most details without looking words up. So material you comprehend 95-98% of or more. For extensive reading, simply read for pleasure without any word lookups and learn words from context. Beginners will find graded readers most useful for this in the beginning.\n\nSome learners eventually blend the two methods. So they might pick something they comprehend a bit less than 95% of but still read extensively since they can comprehend enough to figure out some new words from context alone. Or they might find a novel they can comprehend the main idea without word lookup, and still lookup new words to speed up learning new words. Some may find a slightly challenging reading material, and decide to only look up a few words instead of all unknown words so they don't slow down too much. So most people decide what combination they like best and then stick with that. I personally like to do some extensive only reading where I look up nothing, and then find harder materials where I look up a handful of key words or all unknown words depending on the amount of free time I have. I find that regularly doing something challenging intensive reading (or L R Method) increases my vocabulary, and regularly extensive reading helps my overall comprehension and reading speed.", "created_utc": "1664818895.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqwr916", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xth837", "parent_id": "t3_xth837", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you enjoy learning by doing, I highly recommend looking up \"Comprehensible Input\" learning channels.

Most of these channels will start with beginner material then progress in difficulty, and by the time you're consuming intermediate/B1-B2 level videos you should be able to continue learning by also simply watching/reading stuff in your target langage.\n\nAyan Academy has some textbooks written to teach by comprehensible input uploaded as videos with text and audio to their channel, and these books like English By the Nature Method, French by the Nature Method, Italian by the Nature Method, are designed to get you to intermediate so you can then progress to just reading/watching material for native speakers.\n\nComprehensible Input French is a french channel with lessons going from beginner onward, Simply Chinese is a new youtube channel for comprehensible input chinese, Dreaming Spanish is an excellent comprehensible input channel for spanish, Nat\u00fcrlich German is a comprehensible input german channel, Comprehensible Russian, Learn Korean in Korean is a comprehensible input for korean that's very well made, Comprehensible Japanese covers some material. \nItalian for Americans for beginners and Impara l'Italiano con Italiano Automatico for intermediate learners are good comprehensible input italian channels.

For me, I noticed at a certain point I just ended up wanting to study active skills too since I'd made friends and wanted to talk to people/message on sites more. \n\nI learned French primarily for reading, made progress in an amount of time that felt fast to me (3-6 months reading while looking words up, 6 months - 1 year with graded readers and no lookups or articles with a handful of word lookups, 1 year+ only picking up words from context, at 2 years could read anything I wanted and it felt as easy as reading english). My study plan was mainly: study 1000 common words from a wordlist online with sentences, read a grammar guide summary, start reading and looking a handful of words up per material, read another grammar guide this time in french, read Le Francais Par Le Methode Nature, read stuff with no word lookups until it becomes easy. I did it because I found some old early 1900s french books and some french history books, and just really wanted to read them.\n\nAfter those first 2 years, I did end up doing a lot of listening study because I wanted to have better listening skills, and I did some initial writing/speaking the first 3 months when I took a beginner French class which is when I found the books I got interested in. So later about 1 year in I tried HelloTalk and made some french friends, and lightly practiced writing skills every once in a while. I still have quite poor writing/speaking skills due to having barely any active vocabulary since I rarely write/speak. I've got a great passive vocabulary though, and some dedicated speaking/writing practice and error correction could probably go a long way.\n\nI also focused mainly on passive skills for Japanese and Chinese initially. Like French, eventually months or years in I wanted some speaking/writing capability too so I eventually added some  activities to my study to work on those. Passive skills for Japanese got much better after cram studying through Nukemarine's LLJ memrise decks, Clozemaster's 100 most common japanese words collection, and now doing audio-flashcard lessons is helping my listening skill a ton. As in I noticed no ability to read anything, to being able to handle video games and manga with no dictionary help and handle novels with kindle apps click-translation in a year of study. My listening skill is also gradually improving. My speaking/writing is almost non existent because I never practice. With Chinese, I made an excellent study plan that worked for me and got into reading webnovels in 8 months with a click-dictionary and from 2 years onward was able to start reading some things fully with no word-lookup needed. About 1 year in I was able to start watching shows with chinese subs and not look up words, about 2 years in I was able to start listening to audio dramas and audiobooks and sometimes follow the gist - and I'm still working on it. Speaking/writing skills are worst, but okay enough to have conversations with people and chat, and that makes sense as I practiced from month 5 onward every several months for a few weeks each.

I like Readibu a lot now for finding reading material at a good level for me, and so far it's free version has been more than enough. There's a website I also use to estimate difficulty of a reading material, http://www.zhtoolkit.com/apps/wordlist/create-list.cgi?rm=makevocabform . There's also Chinese Text Analyser (a one time fee program to buy), but I rarely use the computer to read so I haven't used the program, a lot of people use it to estimate text reading difficulty fairly well though. I also used Idiom app, to watch YouTube videos and do some reading. Now I use free app LingoTube for YouTube videos with click-translations, dual subs, and replay looping of individual lines.\n\nFor me LingQs only big advantage since it's translations were worse (about the same as free Idiom app), was that it counts unknown words vs known words for me. I think it works best for people who start LingQ as beginners, but I knew thousands of words already so I was spending a lot of time just marking words I knew which made LingQ less convenient initially for me (but great for people who stick with it). For me Readibu helps more since it it gives an estimate even if i don't mark words I know.", "created_utc": "1664649119.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqnkax9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xsbfno", "parent_id": "t1_iqlpj0s", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "It can be really good if the person using it finds it to be.

That was how it was for me, I took years of language classes in school and made no noticeable progress. So I gave up. What ultimately got me to come back was some interest in some particular thing (but interest comes and goes). What got me to actually stick through learning, was making more specific short term and long term goals to motivate me. At least for me, the problem was the goal \"fluent\" meant nothing to me so I was \"never\" going to get to the goal. When I eventually got older and decided oh my goal is \"I want to read this specific book\" or \"I want to talk to friends about things I like/on my mind at least as okay as a five year old\" I started seeing short and long term progress I could actually measure, stayed motivated, and didn't give up again.

Of the person is already fairly good at dedicating years to another hobby/school subject, so already okay at the \"study/engage regularly\" part.\n\nI think another thing that makes people give up if they use apps: the way so many apps are made For beginners, only teach beginner material, and teach slow. A person wants to say learn Italian to have chats and read novels. They look up how to learn, go on duolingo, figure they'll do 1 lesson or 15 minutes a day and become fluent. 1 year later, maybe they get through the whole duolingo course. They go and try to chat, or read a book, and still can't do it. They're frustrated they spent a year studying and still cant do what they want, and don't know where to go from there since they finished the app that said they'd learn the language. Apps can be used to learn, and some into Intermediate, but as a beginner you just get bombarded with apps like Duolingo and Babbel, Pimsleur and Rosseta Stone which probably won't get you to B1 when you can start doing things beyond tourist conversations. And a lot of beginners may never finish the initial beginner apps. They figure the alternative is take expensive classes which may not be an option, or figure our how to learn themselves and make their own study plans (which is hard to do with no idea where to start with what to even study to cover skills they'll need, or where to even find free study material).

The apps Pleco and Readibu are particularly suited to chinese, but any app with a click-translation works like Google Chrome (highlight a word and click translate option), Kindle app, nearly any eReader app like Moonreader, Microsoft Edge (mobile and computer version have really nice TTS Read Aloud feature along with the highlight translate), LingQ (paid), Idiom app (free) etc. \n\nIt took 5 months to read manhua while looking up a handful of words per chapger, 8 months to learn enough to read simple manhua without a dictionary at all, 1 year to read webnovels with a click-translation tool, 1.5 years to read my first novel extensively with no word lookup and follow the main plot (I read \u5c0f\u738b\u5b50 and in retrospect think some alternatives would've been easier like \u79c3\u79c3\u5927\u738b). From there I did a mix of reading some stuff with a click dictionary and some stuff extensively read with no word lookup (or only occasionally as curious). About 2 years in I could start reading some goal webnovels extensively and follow the main story and some details (I had print copies so was too lazy to look up words). I'm 3 years in now, and to the point where I can now read some easier webnovels extensively and grasp main idea and most details. I am reading some other stuff intensively with word lookup to keep learning words. I'm trying to do a mix of extensive on easier stuff and intensive reading on harder stuff try to up my reading level and reading speed, I also read along to audiobooks a lot more the past year.

I think if you make a study plan geared toward reading its very possible to do reading relatively quickly, I've seen some people read full webnovels with click-translation tools before the end of year 1.

Duolingo is free, and okay for beginner vocabulary/grammar material but once you learn the basics you'll grow out of it being useful. Anki is free and depending on the decks you use (or if you make your own decks) will be useful for a long time for vocabulary learning. You could keep using all. Or just stick to 1-2 for 6 months and then once you're better in the language pick new apps that are more useful for you then: for example using duolingo for grammar and anki for vocabulary for 6 months, then switching to LingQ/FluentU (or free alternatives) and starting to learn to read/watch while learning more vocabulary/grammar as you do. Basically: duolingo and anki and any flashcard/sentence sort of app will teach you vocabulary/grammar (some faster and some slower paced, some covering more or less material), and then other immersion type apps like LingQ help you read/watch/listen to stuff with convenient click translations so it's more learning by doing instead of by example sentences like duolingo. \n\nAlso, if you find learning by Doing works well for you, consider looking up the free \"comprehensible input\" youtube channels with lessons: Dreaming Spanish, Ayan Academy, Learn Korean in Korean, Comprehensible Input French, Simply Chinese, there's German ones and a lot of other ones just search comprehensible input and the language you're studying.

Once you've established the habit of engaging with the language daily, then you can start doing longer stuff which may well be the more enjoyable stuff. You having done duolingo makes sense, its a short lesson to get into the habit, but progress is really slow. If that kind of app/question format is enjoyable to you, maybe try anki, Clozemaster, memrise etc. But I personally think those aren't motivating to me unless I do 30+ minutes a day so I can see progress, and I don't see progress in the apps. I see progress in my other activities beyond that, like when trying to read or watch a show or chat on a language exchange app like Hello Talk and notice things are easier than they used to be. \n\nIf progress is what motivates you specifically, it might be worth thinking of a short term month goal. Think of one long term thing you want to do in the language you're learning, then make a mini \"this month\" goal version of it. So if you want to speak to people one day, make this month's goal \"learn how to introduce myself, say what my hobbies are, ask other people that about them\" and at the end of the month do just that on a language exchange app. If you want to watch shows, pick some episode of something you like/want to see and decide you'll watch it at the end of the month and the goal is to know enough words/grammar to follow the main idea when you do (maybe using a click-dictionary on the subtitles tool like Learn Languages with Netflix extension). Or pick what might be an easier show and make one episode of that your goal for this month. If your goal is to read, make reading 1 chapter or more of a comic (or easy book) your goal for the month. With a small monthly goal, you can make a study plan JUST for that goal, so you'll see progress quickly in that activity. And being able to do something you like with what you learned quickly may be motivating. \n\nI did this a lot as a beginner and still do a version of this for monthly goals. I hated vocabulary apps, but I made myself review 1000 words one month (like 30 minutes - 1 hour a day) because I wanted to know enough words to try watching a show. It got me to study enough, and once I could watch a show I could drop the vocabulary apps for a while and just watch/look words up until I wanted to make real-fast progress again.\n\nSmaller things you can do, to just make studying a habit. Note that if progress motivates you, you're just not going to see that motivation until study time gets longer. So don't get discouraged, it may feel more like exploring the language and getting used to engaging with it daily at first. You can start watching shows/vloggers/lets plays something you enjoy in your target language with english subs. Get out a translator app like Google Translate (or something you like better) and just look up a word of the language here and there as you get curious a few times whenever you watch. It's easy, its doing what you already enjoy in english, and its making a habit of engaging with the target language with some study (the occasional word lookups). If you happen to be learning japanese, watching a youtube channel like Game Gengo may work well as he speaks/explains in english but teaches a lot of japanese from games, so you can enjoy 'just relaxing and watching' while gradually learning some language and getting a habit of studying. Or for chinese, lots of shows have dual chinese/english subtitles and a small habit of just looking words up whenever curious is easy with the chinese hanzi to look at and write into google translate as they look. I started with just that my first couple months of chinese, and that's what eventually got me into studying a lot more. If progress motivates you, honestly short lesson formats like youtube channels that teach colors one day, introductions the next, how to talk about weather the next, may motivate you. Because at the end of each 5 minute video you'll feel you learned something you can use now. Listening to audio lessons as you exercise/walk/drive is also an easy way to make a habit of daily engagement without changing your routine, and for me even when I don't focus 100% I notice them adding up to improvement.

This 98% comprehension is usually applied to when people extensively read content with no dictionary. That % feels like reading \"I went to the store, it was an X day and my umbrella flew away\" where you can reasonably guess X and figure it out through the context of the story if it's important, and can easily follow the entire story even though you don't know some words. When you grew up you likely read a lot of stuff at around this comprehension where you'd run into a few new words/terms and figure them out through context without them impeding your understanding too much.\n\nDreaming Spanish, and similar type materials (check out Ayan Academy YouTube for some textbook examples) are made to be very comprehensible. So if even the easiest DS is not comprehensible, try rewatching a few times. Material made to Teach Through Comprehensible Input (so stuff made for learners) is made to use visuals and gestures to help you with a lot of additional context to understand the meaning. So in video lessons like DS a learner may no zero words, but hear the word for \"i\" and see the speaker point to themselves, see a picture of an apple and see someone point at it and say the word for apple. Hear someone point to apple and say words then \"apple\", Take the apple away and say words plus another word plus apple indicating no apple. And the learner has enough context to grasp that they'd heard \"this is an apple\" and \"this is not an apple.\" So you may know way less than 98% of the words, but the content is made to give you so much surrounding context you can understand anyway. So as long as you can grasp the ideas being conveyed to you, you comprehend it enough. If you can rewatch a couple times until you grasp the ideas conveyed, you understand enough. If after a few watches you do not understand what was shown to you and explained, the lesson may be too hard. \n\nPersonally, I think one can also learn from lower levels of comprehension than 98% but it is going to feel a bit more draining just because focus and problem solving skills get drawn on more. First, if you plan to use a translator app/click dictionary etc when engaging with content then you can learn from something you comprehend less well, since you can look up key words as you go to make sure you understand the main idea conveyed (in a video, in a reading material etc). You can look up All unknown words if you wanted, making anything you can follow the main idea of With the help of looking words up become good enough material to learn from.\n\nPersonally, what I use for comprehensible input is anything I can read/watch/hear and at minimum follow the Main Idea of the content without a looking things up. That is the cut off for if I can learn from a material just by engaging with it or not. If I can watch a show, even if I don't know what X said to Y during a monologs, if I get that the monologue was X confessed to a crime and Y said they were lying then that's good enough comprehension. If I read Little Red Riding Hood in my target language and cant tell if the girl is skipping or running, can't tell what trees are described, just that she's traveling through the woods to grandma generally, then that's good enough comprehension. If I can grasp that main idea, then I have enough context to guess and figure out the meaning of some new words. If I cannot even grasp the main idea of what's happening overall, then I will probably struggle really hard to pick up any new words/understanding by engaging with the material (unless I use tools to help like a click dictionary to figure out enough To follow the main idea).", "created_utc": "1664165079.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipxjq9r", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xnedbk", "parent_id": "t3_xnedbk", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "United States, took Spanish class 1 year, German 2 years, Chinese 1 year.

I took German for 2 years in high school and even that class at Most put me at maybe A2 (because we learned a couple thousand words or more) at best, probably less than that. In comparison the college classes definitely felt they were covering a decent portion of material each semester.\n\nIn college I took 1 semester of French and we learned a significant beginner foundation, thanks to a good teacher. We learner 100 common er verbs and conjugation, simple present past and future tenses so we could talk about many topics if we looked up some key words, along with all the usual beginner stuff. Thanks to that class I was able to jump into self study afterwards and push into reading relatively fast, it was a great foundation. I also took 1 semester of japanese in college. The class covered decent material, the 1st half of Genki textbook. It covered 100 Kanji, all kana, a few hundred vocabulary words, a lot of shadowing audio pronunciation and writing/speaking/reading exercises thanks to the specific assignments the teacher had us do so we would practice reading/listening/writing/speaking. It gave me a very good speaking/listening foundation. We maybe learned ~500 vocabulary words which isn't a lot but seemed fast paced for a japanese class. It didn't get me as far as the college beginner French, but it was a good starting point from which to move onto self studying. In both cases, I think the college classes covered good amounts of material and covered multiple language skills practice well.

I think with a language similar to your own you might not need much listening practice to get decent listening skills.

Like some chinese audiobook or audio flashcards during daily walks, when cleaning, when doing busy work at work, playing audio when I'm doing level grinding in video games where nothing much is happening etc, which quickly can add up to 4+ hours a day (just replacing playing music during busy work or driving with chinese alone adds usually 1+ hours of listening). I don't listen to stuff everyday, but the days I do listen it has gotten easier to add at least an hour. Generally, the more listening you get in the better your listening skill will be. So like all study, the more hours you put in the faster you'll hit progress milestones in days. It'll be roughly the same \"study\" hours no matter if you listen to 30 minutes a day or 3 hours a day, the difference is mostly just how that changes how many days the milestones will take to get to. And every little bit does add up, so even 10 minutes a day is great! For chinese I didn't listen to much outside of show watching until year 2! So there was a lot of progress I didn't make till much later, where I would've had better listening skills by 2 years in if I'd just been doing any purposeful listening earlier.", "created_utc": "1663966766.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipn30ee", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xltgnd", "parent_id": "t3_xltgnd", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If the class regimen structure specifically helped, maybe going to an online course like on Coursera, MITs free courses, or even FSI and putting on your schedule to do 5 hours of work a day. Like 1 module a day-3 modules depending on how long they are, or do 1 module and every single homework and exercise assignments and shadowing dialogues/audio to be able to produce it yourself etc (I find when doing them all the material is more well rounded). If you put in X hours on your calendar each day it may help you retain your high intensity schedule, and courses with a lot of structure may also help keep this format since you can aim to cover X segments of material daily. For Japanese this could also mean looking at the same textbook as your class used (or a faster paced one), and continuing where the class left off. Doing the same pace and amount of exercises on your own, to keep going the same pace. Looking up books/courses/free resources specifically designed to pass the JLPT tests could be a good place to look for focused well rounded materials too. \n\nIf you want to have more of the flexibility of self study, as in picking more variety of materials and perhaps doing more immersion, then it may take some short term experimenting with different study materials and overall study plans until you find one that works well at progressing toward your goals And that you can study for long periods daily. \n\nYou may search r/Refold, Mass Immersion Approach, and older AJATT online if you want to lean heavily into SRS like anki, and immersion. There's a lot of people who've learned japanese with 2-8 hour a day study schedules that way (a benefit of immersion for learning is how it's easier to squeeze more study time in as it doubles as normal time you'd spend on hobbies like shows, games, reading and audio can be done at the same time as other activities). I personally went from a fast paced Japanese college class that used genki, then moved onto using Nukemarines Lets Learn Japanese user made memrise courses (which cover kanji, 2k core common words, grammar from Tae Kims Grammar Guide), alongside reading/watching/playing game. I eventually added on audio flashcards from japaneseaudiolessons.com (and loved their Kanji books), and used Clozemaster Japanese 100 most common words (800 sentences) for some more varied grammar and common words, to make up for some spots I'd missed in other study. That study plan was quite effective for me and I've stuck with that pretty much since, with chatting with others and some purposeful grammar exercises from sentence pattern grammar books to practice output. I prefer to learn from context though hence I leaned heavily into study to make playing games/watching/reading possible asap so I could start learning by doing. I think if someone likes structured study more there's also really good options for that. And self study allows for exploring multiple resources until you can find what matches your goals and teaches you new stuff toward those goals effectively. \n\nFor self study, the more you can make learning Japanese part of your daily life the easier it is to fit more time in for it. So if you can watch more in Japanese instead of English, listen to Japanese audio more instead of English podcasts/radio/YouTube etc, play games you were already playing in Japanese instead, making friends so you chat regularly in Japanese, reading Japanese manga or novels or forums etc. As for strict time schedules, honestly just putting in your daily schedule/calendar time blocked out specifically for X planned study activities helps. That might look like 20 minutes blocked out for anki at lunch, 2 hours blocked out to read something, 1 hour blocked out to watch something, and 20 minutes blocked after read/watching to make new anki cards (if you make your own) if you went the Refold type route. Or it could mean 30 minutes in morning to read through a textbook chapter, 15 minutes at lunch to read over new vocab, after work 30 minutes to listen to dialogue and practice reading it recognizing the new vocab, 30 minutes to shadow the dialogues audio,1 hour after work to work through chapter exercises, 1 hour to do a little self writing and audio recording exercise where you practice writing your own \"journal\" using what you learned in the chapter and practice saying it. Adjust times and when during the day according to your own preferences. For me, I found 2 hours of purposeful study was all I needed most days, the rest would be immersion some days, and eventually only maybe 30 minutes was study and most time became immersion time going from 2 hours to 8 hours depending on how into something I got that day. Specific schedules of blocking out specific activities I find easier to stick to if trying to maintain a lot of hours, and personally I find goals of \"get through X chapters, X videos, X lessons\" per month to be motivating to me and help me keep track of if I'm studying as much as I planned to. But I never was the type of person to get up to 5 hours study a day, other people are going to have more experience on how to make that routine.", "created_utc": "1663966346.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipn225i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xm4a41", "parent_id": "t3_xm4a41", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm not sure how much this will help, as I'm going through the process too right now. Here are some things I do which seem to help speed up the process somewhat. \n\n- Purposely picking new genres to read in. I am not going to learn more economics words unless I purposely read news about it, nonfiction about it, or at least some fiction that discusses economic terms regularly. Same with any other topic I'd like better vocabulary in. I already did it naturally with topics I read regularly, so now I need to expand the same way I did in english by having to read different genres and on different subjects.\n\n- Intensively reading something significantly above my reading level for a little bit. Since I can read extensively now and pick up words gradually from that, I pick something significantly harder to run into more unknown words faster. I intensively read for a bit to really drill the new words by looking them up over and over until they stick in my mind. Then I can shift into extensive reading again and just get more familiar with the new words, or go onto something else. This also works with picking a new genre and just wanting to learn new terms/words in that topic without needing to read as much. I read intensively with a click-dictionary tool (like google translate highlight on a webpage, Kindle click-dictionary, Moonreader Pro app dictionary etc) which keeps lookups from taking too much time.\n\n- Listening Reading Method, particularly with something significantly above my reading level or in a genre/topic I am less familiar with the vocabulary of. For me L R Method works really well, only takes the time of listening to each chapter twice, and it helps me drill all the unknown words in a text broadly and quickly. I usually end up picking up a lot of new words in a fairly short time period like 10-40 hours.\n\n- I don't use SRS Flashcards anymore, but getting or making particular SRS flashcard collections on new words you want to learn and particularly in key topics, could speed things along. SRS flashcards (on paper or on apps like anki) work efficiently to get people to recognize a word quickly. They helped me a lot in learning the first 2000 words, but after that I wanted to solidify that recognition with reading and learn the rest of my words just regularly through reading. But I do know some learners who like SRS apps tend to like to study new words like this, since it is fairly rapid to get initial recognition. I spend an hour on 5 SRS flashcards so its a waste of time for me ToT.\n\n- And finally, even if we learn 100 words a day week etc, once we are in the intermediate plateau it just takes thousands and thousands of words to even notice them improving our comprehension generally.

I know this is primarily because my chinese vocab is simply way smaller than my english, where I like to write in depth and 'sink into' details way more now. But it's kind of fun letting my brain go back to thinking more like the way I used to word things. I also think I am incredibly lucky in that a lot of writers I gravitated to early on, write in chinese in a way that is similar to how I write now. I think because of that similarity, I was drawn to them as 'easier.' And because of that similarity, me simplifying my writing down can still do the kind of sentence structure effects I like, because I see similar effects when I read. So I guess, in a way chinese gets me writing more to the point again, and then that bleeds over into writing english more to the point like I used to. \n\nRegarding french, since I studied that too - I think the same changes happened to me!

If I actually need a language for a specific job/moving, then I would find things about it that puts it in the first category. Because interest motivates, and tangible goal motivates. If you learn it for a theoretical job, you may not actually specifically have an interest in doing business in X language or translation in X, at least not until you have the job. So get interested in reading on business in that language, on conferences held in it, in translating in it now. That for me would make the studying easier. \n\nI learned French for value of a theoretical job in X places. That motivation alone did not get me to learning anything significant, however it might be enough for others. But buying some history books in French did get me motivated to learn (I like reading about history and love old books and how they may be different than now) and got me reading. I made some friends who speak French so I had motivation now to speak and write it, otherwise I wasn't going to practice those skills and get them decent before some theoretical job was acquired. Interest personally helps motivate me. It's definitely not needed I don't think, but if it happens to motivate you well then it helps. I also think it gives you a lot more to look forward to in a language. I never thought much about learning French the way some people want to learn it for culture or things they love, I just thought French or Spanish would be useful in a few places I wanted to work. I knew I got motivated by interest though so I tried to find things that would make me interested in using French regularly. \n\nIn the end though, you will know what's best for you. Value is extremely motivating in some situations, and value may be the only reasonable choice when in a situation where you need it now/soon. And I studied a lot I hated and excelled so you don't need interest to learn ToT. \n\nIf you have the time, and no need or huge pressure requiring you to learn a language to a certain ability by a certain time, why not try learning both a language you are interested in and one you find valuable? Trying both out may answer your own question for you.

More stuff like this will open up as you learn more, like comics you've read before in a language you know, in Spanish so you remember the overall plot and have visuals to help. \n\nAnd for looking up some stuff, you can also go for reading materials where you're still mostly just relaxing and engaging. So a bit harder than dreaming Spanish for you but still easy enough you can follow broadly the main things happening. Finding something you can kind of follow the main idea, then looking up just a handful of words when curious or you can't figure a word out from context. And just skipping confusing sentences, letting some stuff go, not pushing yourself to translate/look up everything unknown but just stuff that seems critical for understanding the main idea (or that you're particularly curious about).

I was able to read anything I wanted within 2 years. I could also write to friends whenever, but I did purposely study to communicate a little. Toward the beginning of learning I studied the \"300 words in a language tumblr\" list which is 300 words to help you express most any idea simply with a dictionary to help you for specific topic unknown words, and some grammar study in addition to learn a past/present/future to express yourself. I had to read grammar guides anyway to learn to read, but I did specifically focus on the j'ai/I have done verb je vais/ I'm going to verb and je verb/I'm doing verb forms. Because knowing those early along with the 300 words let me write stuff like \"I'm going to work, I dream of one day working in space, I have a big family and we all love making art, I'm good at making art\" etc very early on which for me personally was motivating. So I still use that list for new language study. If I hadn't cared to write early, this part wouldn't matter though, so a person doesn't need to learn to write/communicate at all until much later on if they don't want to.\n\nHowever the downside of course is, since I didn't speak it then I still don't speak it well. Since I didnt study listening much at all, I can't follow much French audio. After 2 years in, once my reading goals were met, I started using audio only resources and shadowing the audio (speaking aloud to try to sound like it) to improve my own speaking and listening comprehension. One benefit of some audio study was I got much better at distinguishing Spanish, Italian, and French apart which made my French reading skills better and made remembering French words in reading form to audio recognition easier. I mostly just listened to 1 pronunciation guide site, Coffee Break French and LanguageTransfer French, some comprehensible input French youtube channels, and Ayan Academy youtubes upload of audio for Le Francais Par Le Methode Nature (which has text in video so I can read along which helped since my reading is strong). I still don't speak super well (my active vocabulary is often rusty since I rarely actively use language), but I was able to develop speaking and listening skills fine Years after the reading/writing skills. So you can definitely go OPPOSITE Benny Lewis's route lol and save speaking for later! Plenty of people save speaking for years later, plenty of people do it earlier, some do it once they're intermediate, and in all cases it works out. So do what's best for you.\n\nI do think some audio listening earlier on is beneficial though. I personally find that when I listen to audio with reading as a beginner (like audio books with graded readers, learner podcasts with transcripts, textbook dialogues with audio etc), I find the language is easier for me to remember and distinguish. But I think part of that is with french I had no mental idea of what it sounded like prior to studying, so I'd easily remember \"English pronunciation/Spanish pronunciation\" of New French words I'd read, which was totally wrong and confused me so much later when id hear the word and it was totally different lol. Later after audio study, I had a mental sound for French and could guess new word pronunciations when I read better, which helped translate reading skill into speaking/listening skills. And with chinese when I studied, audio often helped so much with me learning and remembering hanzi and words. I am so glad I studied listening as well as reading, even though my listening skill lags, the effort I'd put into it benefited all my other language skills and made them easier.", "created_utc": "1663793502.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipdrr60", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkcmwu", "parent_id": "t3_xkcmwu", "score": "37", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm not sure if you, or anyone knows of a guide, for how to get a wechat account?

Whether you learn a word using flashcards, or by reading and looking the word up (or figuring it out from context), you will still need to keep running into the word several times in materials to really learn it beyond simple recognition. Reading naturally gives you words you've looked up, again and again (usually). So you can both initially get recognition of the word, and then get lots of practice actually remembering its meaning and comprehending it. \n\nBut doing flashcards, then reading/watching/conversing often and running into the words in your flashcards until they go from recognized to easily understood, is the same kind of process.

For someone able to focus on flashcards, one can study 20-50 (or way more) new words per day, which is going to be faster for them.

I started studying Chinese 3 years ago primarily to learn to read, but also ultimately to chat with others and watch shows/listen to audios. When I started I expected it to take as long as Japanese took me or longer, so 3 years to read comics, and 4-6 years to start reading novels with a click-dictionary-translation tool to aid me.\n\nChinese went surprisingly well, I think I'd just made a good study plan this time around and really challenged myself early and often. Whereas in japanese I think I'd always been 'afraid' things would be too hard, and kept holding myself back from learning as fast as I could. I just hit my 3rd year studying chinese, and I can read my goal novel (that I started learning for) extensively without a dictionary. I can read easier novels now in a day or two. I can read anything I want with full comprehension with a click-dictionary, and with fairly good comprehension without one. I'm farther than I thought I'd be in 4-6 years of study. I can also text to friends in chinese, talk casually with them in chinese, and I can listen to audio dramas and some audiobooks. Now my biggest goal is just to get to the point I can listen to audiobooks and follow fairly easily, because its more convenient to listen to an audiobook while I do other things than set aside time to read ToT. Also because some chinese audiobooks have actors for each character which is cool to listen to. \n\nLearning French went similarly, but I had a worse study plan and stumbled luckily to my goals eventually. I still have more goals in French for if I look for work that requires French writing skills, but I reached my read-anything-I-want goal within 2 years.\n\nI was in my 20s when I started studying languages. If I have any advice, I don't know if it would apply to you. For me, what helped the most: making very specific short and long term goals, purposely doing what I wanted immediately in the language and regularly (even if I thought it might 'be too hard'), and regularly making myself study new challenging content so I didn't hold myself back going over and over easier things instead of pushing toward new things to learn. \n\nSo for example in Chinese, this meant I tried to read novels from the first month (which was wild looking back now), and continuing to focus my goals on 'how does one prepare to read novels' until month 5 when I forced myself to read show subtitles, month 8 when I made myself read comics I thought would be 'too hard', and month 10 when I pushed into reading novels with click-dictionary tools, then month 12 when I regularly also pushed myself to read 'harder' stuff and try reading with no tools regularly. With speaking it meant getting on language exchange apps in month 5 and trying to chat, looking up pronunciation guides/practice apps when I realized my tones sucked, looking up words I needed to say etc, then trying to chat again every few months about more topics. With listening same thing - trying to watch shows in the first year with no subs, trying to listen to audio dramas/books in second year with and without subs, just trying and not being scared to start trying. If I'd pushed myself like that in japanese I think my progress would've been faster, and progress in japanese has gotten faster since I just started trying to play games, read novels, and do things I thought would be 'too hard'. Also, doing things I like regularly show me the progress I gradually make, and remind me why I want to learn. \n\nAnd then the other piece, 'specific goals.' Its always easier for me to study effectively when I know what I'm studying in a given month. Like the month my goal was \"better pronunciation\" I could look up how to do that and practice those exercises and measure my improvement, the month my goal was read a comic I could look up how people did that and what they studied to prepare and plan to do similar. Before I made good study plans, my goal would just be 'become fluent' and I never knew what that meant to me. So I'd flounder for 1-2 years learning basic tourist stuff, never learning enough words to read or the right past/future tenses to start having conversations about my life, and then give up.  Specific short term goals of 'read with the help of a tool' and long term goals of 'read what I want with no tools', short term 'pronounce tones recognizably' and long term 'talk to friends about whatever we want' motivate me and keep my study plan focused on actually getting me to work on the things I want to be able to do.", "created_utc": "1663348191.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioot8g4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xemznf", "parent_id": "t3_xemznf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Small thing like your tip: changing my google account's language to my target language. I did that with French back 5 months into learning, and got used to my email navigation menu in French, google results auto-giving me French wikipedia and French versions of news sites, LinkedIn sending me things regularly in French. I didn't read French regularly outside of that (just in bursts) and even after years of not actively touching French, I still run into it daily because of this. I've never forgotten how to read French lol! And I think this is a big reason I eventually started reading french as 'unnoticed' as english, so now I still regularly see french google results but I don't even notice they're in french.\n\nAudio flashcard files. Which for me is a sentence in the TL, then in english, then in TL. Old Glossika files are basically this, japaneseaudiolessons.com audio lessons are this, Clozemaster radio mode is this, and I used Chinese Spoonfed Anki audio files that are just the anki deck in this format in 30 minute audio files. I started just listening to these kinds of things in the background during some days, when I'm doing busy work at work, cleaning, walking, driving, doing grinding in video games. So easy for me to add more study time. I had bad listening skills  before I started this, but once I started doing this I noticed a lot of improvement even when I barely focused on the audio and mostly ignored it in the background. I tried this after hearing 'relistening' to audio multiple times helped listening skills. For me, SRS apps are hard for me to reliably do, and most 'purposeful study' outside of just reading/watching shows I don't like to consistently do. So audio flashcard files made doing some purposeful study a lot easier, since I didn't have to change anything and they still appear to help me improve when I don't focus perfectly. Adding audio in your target language to your day, whether its fully comprehensible audio flashcard sentences/language learning lesson podcasts or just random things you've heard before, really adds up and helps.

Just review in a spaced repetition manner. You can either look up what spaced amount would work best for you, or like me just randomly open your vocabulary webpage/notebook and read through it every once in a while. I did this with French, and it worked perfectly fine - I used a 2000 common word list I found online with sentences and audio. I studied that list first a lot when I read through it the first time, then reviewed it by glancing every few weeks to see what I'd forgotten versus remembered, then by 3 months in I'd learned the words and no longer read the list. After that, I just moved on to learning new vocabulary through immersion.\n\nIf you read in your target language, and just look up words you don't know (when you feel curious and want to learn that word or feel you need to look up that word to comprehend the main idea), you'll increase your vocabulary. Reading regularly will naturally make you run into newly learned words repeatedly (review/repetition) and re-looking up words if you forgot them is again just review/repetition. It isn't as efficient as SRS apps, but it still works well. I learned the first 1000 common words in french just glancing at a word list regularly, so I'd recognize enough words to start trying to read graded readers and news articles and at minimum \"comprehend the overall main idea\" with 10 word lookups per page or less (so only looking up words critical for understanding the main point). It worked, and in 3 months I'd gotten familiar enough with 1000 words to read while looking key-words up for main idea, then 6 months in I'd reviewed all 2000 words on the list and was familiar enough with the words to stop studying the word list. From there, I moved on to only learning words by looking them up when reading/watching something. Then eventually, primarily learning words through context alone (once I had a higher comprehension level).\n\nGerman is close enough to english, that even with a little loss in 'efficiency' from not using SRS and instead reviewing at possibly random intervals, you'll still make progress at a reasonable pace. The only languages where using spaced repetition study timing significantly speeded up how fast I learned new words was Japanese and Chinese, since without cognates or similarities to english I really needed to learn a huge amount before even attempting to read so I needed to learn a lot of words as fast as possible.

I'm reading through the recs now. I am learning chinese and regularly read raws, and was thinking of trying to translate something soon if something I'm reading has no translation yet. Seeing recs of cool stuff in chinese I might not have found otherwise is nice!\n\nFor reading raws, yes to what you said about going on jjwxc etc to purchase and support authors. Like you mentioned, amazon sometimes has ebook/print novel versions you can buy to support as well. I also often buy print novels from books.com.tw (ships international and has an english language option on top bar), which may be a good idea if you really like a novel and want a physical copy, or plan to learn chinese later down the road. Also, some print copies contain additional scenes (and some are censored and contain less). My \u9547\u9b42 print edition has additional scenes, additional extras, and just some plot improvements over the webnovel version (Seven Seas Danmei is translating the webnovel version which is fine since its what everyone knows best, but I am grateful I have my print version since the english unofficial and official translations may never have some scenes in it). For print novels, Google Translate and Google Lens apps both do OCR translation which works well if someone can read a bit of chinese and tell when the MTL is way off. Google's OCR can also just pull the chinese text from a picture, so you can take a picture of a book page then copy/paste into a better MTL like DeepL or Baidu Fanyi or Pleco app.\n\nOther things that may help: mtlnovels.com has the ability to display traditional hanzi raws next to MTL translations if you make a free account. As a beginner learner I did this to read through \u9ed8\u8bfb before it was fully translated (into edanglarstranslations wonderful translation). If you can recognize a little chinese, the ability to view both chinese/english MTL at once helps make any weird parts of the MTL easier to read. Deepl.com is a MTL site that I think does the best 'overall' job of making a mtl readable. DeepL's translations aren't perfect, but overall I find they read better and have less mistakes than Google Translate. I've used DeepL to MTL some novels of dramas I liked like Monarch Industry and The Wolf, and it was readable. Also, usually the biggest 'easy errors to spot' that MTLs make is change the gender of he/she and MTL sometimes translating names as 'objects/words' instead of realizing its a name. So quickly looking up character names/translations for those hanzi before reading an MTL makes it easier to notice when an MTL meant 'ah Mo Ran's name' instead of 'ink dyeing.' Baidu Fanyi website/app also does decent MTLs but overall I still find DeepL's translations more readable. \n\nFor people who know a little chinese or plan to learn, reading tool apps with click dictionaries like Pleco and Readibu are great. With Pleco you can open a jjwxc page (or any webnovel webpage), click each word for an instant translation, AND click 'translate whole page' and get an instant Google Translation within the app. Which is a nice feature if one wants to go between totally MTL and glancing at the chinese novel to double check some words/sections. Readibu is another reading tool app with click definitions for free, and its paid version includes Google Translate for sentences within the app (or someone can just have Google Translate/DeepL open and copy/paste, and just use Readibu for certain specific section word translations they think didn't make sense in the MTL). \n\nI sometimes search tuijian \u63a8\u8350 or \u63a8\u4e66 tuishu (recommendation, recommend book) and \u5c0f\u8bf4 xiaoshuo (novel), and \u803d\u7f8edanmei(bl) \u540c\u4ebatongren(gay) \u767e\u5408baihe(gl) into a search engine when looking for new novel recommendation lists or novel popularity rankings. On jjwxc there's some ranking lists by genre that are good places to look for new novels. \n\nSome raw recs:\n\n- \u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6545\u4e8b by \u4e00\u6839\u9ec4\u74dc\u4e1d\u513f Their Story, a danmei novel (there's also a gl manhua with the same name). This is a short slice of life that is written in a straightforward emotional way, about a guy who loses his love in his first life to his cousin, and then relives his life again and chooses to not fall for that first love again. Its bittersweet and angsty, straightforward, and it made me feel a lot of things.\n\n- C\u8bed\u8a00\u4fee\u4ed9 C Language Cultivation. A translator picked it up but its only translated to chapter 4. Aliexpress recommended me to buy the print copy of this, since it recs me so much danmei ToT. Its a cultivation danmei set in modern time period, which sounds like a cool concept to me.\n\n- \u593a\u68a6 Seizing Dreams.

Listening Reading Method (there's a lot of in depth stuff about it), in short just combining listening-reading helps both skills a lot. Reading in my target languages with click-dictionaries intensively and no help extensively, reading motivates me more than any other activity lol.

I need to constantly engage with at least some new material that challenges me in a new way, because its going to teach me something new. But I tend to be a perfectionist, so I know if I focus only on something until I 'understand it fully' then I will drill one single thing far beyond its usefulness and only learn that one thing's content, when instead I could have engaged with hundreds of things that taught me much more overall. \n\nRelistening is really useful though. So while I don't listen to things until I understand them fully, I think relistening can help a lot. I will relisten to something 5-10 times in the background some days, and notice I pick up more and more each time. So repeated listening helps improve my listening comprehension, which then improves how much I understand, which then improves how much new stuff I can learn from the context of that audio. Eventually when I understand a majority of what's going on, there's diminishing returns. But at my level where my reading is stronger than listening, relistening allows me to get better at hearing words I know in reading. Relistening to content with a few months between I also find useful. To see how much progress I've made in my increase in understanding it, review the things I learned last time I studied it, and with my increased understanding try to pick up new things from context. \n\nSummary: I don't relisten until I understand it 'fully' but there's value in relistening to a reasonable degree. Its not going to change a study plan much to relisten to something 5-10 times in the background as you do other things, or listen to an audiobook/drama/show audio an extra time or two trying to focus on the parts you didn't grasp in the first listen.", "created_utc": "1663099440.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioav7px", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xdd521", "parent_id": "t3_xdd521", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Good luck!", "created_utc": "1663029567.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io71d3c", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xcrrn1", "parent_id": "t1_io70o1a", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you have French subtitles on when watching French shows/movies, then yes your study method will eventually help you learn enough French to watch French stuff if the French subtitles are on.

I eventually needed to listen to some French to pick up listening skills, since reading did not teach me pronunciation.

Personally, I think specific goals help. If your goal is \"become fluent in X\" or \"learn X language\" try to think of what that actually means to you. Does it mean buy objects and order food when you travel, or talk about your dreams and goals and how to do your hobbies. Does it mean read a restaurant menu, or read comics, or read novels, or read technical research. Does it mean listen to a conversation, or podcasts, or audiobooks, or lectures. Does it mean text with friends, or write a blog, or write essays, or write work reports, or write novels. Figure out what you actually want to do in the language short term and long term. Then whenever you are unsure what to do, look at your goals and decide what you can do to get better at doing that goal. \n\nIf you aren't making progress, try to always be studying at least half new material that is challenging to you. If you're spending at least some time on new vocabulary, grammar, skill building etc then you are eventually going to make progress. If you continuously study the same things, but don't branch out, you may eventually stall or not know what to do next to increase your language skills. If you pick your own study materials, like say various textbooks/podcast/cpurses you study from, try to move onto new books which cover new material when you finish one, don't pick another book that teaches no new words and grammar (or at least don't spend all your study time reviewing topics you've already studied before). \n\nA lot of apps only have beginner lessons (A1-A2), and to me they feel they cover information slowly. Duolingo may take 2 years to cover what you could learn in 1 year from two college classes, or in 6 months from a textbook or self-study plan you work through faster. So yes there are faster options besides apps (though apps can be good if you do them frequently, and they motivate you to study new things regularly). \n\nAgain, check this sub's page with resources for ideas on how to make a study plan. Some resources you might use: buy textbooks yourself and just work through them doing all exercises, trying to learn all 4 speaking, listening, reading, writing skills. Continue through progressively harder textbooks in a set. Or take a free coursera course and then go through the progressively higher courses. Or look up language level tests like CEFR, JLPT, HSK etc and find study textbooks/free courses/free sites which cover the material on each test so you start at beginner and learn progressively more well into a higher level. Those are very structured options where you can just follow a plan. \n\nOther options: pick your short and long term goals, and work toward them. Look up what other people did to accomplish X goal, and adapt their plans to work for you. I wanted to read novels, so I looked up how to read novels in a foreign language. I followed what other people did: I read a free online grammar guide summary, learned 2000 common words with an srs app (anki, memrise, clozemaster etc all work, so does just a plain printed vocabulary list you regularly review), then started reading graded readers then regular sites and ebooks with click-dictionary tools (or Google translate/any translate app). When I wanted to learn to watch shows, I also needed the 2000 common words and grammar guide so that covered multiple goals, and needed some listening skill. So I listened through a pronunciation guide and studied it, and studied the 2000 words with a user made srs memrise deck which included audio. I studied using audio sentences that started easier and got harder, like graded reader audio, srs flashcard sentences, clozemaster, LanguageTransfer, Glossika, youtube videos, language learning lesson podcasts, etc. To talk/write, I joined a language exchange app and practiced. Etc. I didn't use SRS tools like anki very long since I can't focus well on flashcards, so mostly I used them for initial study of some common words, then switched to just looking up words often when reading and learning from context. I found learning in context easiest for me so I used graded readers, comprehensible input youtube channels and books like Le Francias Par Le Methode Nature, and watching stuff I'd seen before in English. For me, since learning from context when reading is easiest for me, I did a lot of common word and grammar study early on so I could jump into reading asap. What works for me might not work as well for you - some people need more structure, some people need less. Some people learn great from srs flashcards, some like me can't focus very well on them. Some people care about speaking and are motivated much more by that then reading, where i was most motivated by reading. If you aim for your goals, you can adjust a study tool if it doesn't work for you and try out other tools that will get you to your goals until some things do work. \n\nAt the beginning, a structured textbook, course, or free site with gradually more difficult lessons may be easiest to help you form a study plan. Or finding someone who's successfully reached your goal, and then trying out the study plan they did to see how much it works/doesn't work for you. If you realize you learn best doing certain activities, I'd suggest trying to make yourself capable of doing those activities as quickly as you can.

For me, I like to look up a \"grammar guide summary\" for free online, and read through it over month when I'm starting to learn a language. I don't memorize, I just read and try to understand the examples as much as I can, so that later in immersion if I see grammar I may have a vague idea of what I'm looking at. After reading through a grammar guide summary, I learn 2000 words and do immersion. I read a lot, and as I run into the grammar I read about, I look up the grammar that's still confusing me if I feel like looking it up. Since I read a grammar summary, I will have at least some idea of what grammar point I'm noticing that is confusing me so I will know what to look up. Then after several months of reading and looking up grammar clarification occasionally, grammar just sort of clicks. \n\nAfter that, I only read more on grammar if I'm curious. Like finding some interesting grammar book and wanting to read through it, if it goes over some topics more nuanced than the grammar guide summary did and I am interested. And once I start practicing production skills, particularly writing, I find a grammar guide or grammar textbook again so I can practice writing and have something to compare to and check if I made mistakes.\n\nSome people like to do grammar study as classes give it, or as language test levels expect it, or to not study it at all, or do a lot of in depth study of it. What works depends on the person. I like to get an overview by reading through a summary but not memorizing, then just read and let things \"click\" and look up specific grammar points if they really interest me.", "created_utc": "1663026465.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io6uc7s", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xcn1t2", "parent_id": "t3_xcn1t2", "score": "12", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I didn't stop translating in my head until 1 year in for Chinese, 4 years in for Japanese, and 1.5 years in for French. For French, it took reading a lot of novels - eventually I stopped translating in my head. For Chinese, it also took a lot of reading. \n\nThe more I read, the more the grammar looked 'natural' to me and I didn't need to think about what it would be in english to understand it. Once the grammar started to click instantly, then words started clicking easier, and I'd just see them as the chinese word. New chinese words I may translate in my head up to the first dozen times I see them/look them up, then they 'click' too and I just know them as the chinese version. So what it basically came down to, is a lot of exposure.\n\nAlso, sometimes listening a lot helps stuff 'click' as intuitively understood when reading a lot does not seem to be helping you. For japanese, the grammar was so different than english that even once I could read, I still kept translating everything I saw in my head because the grammar took me time to sort through and reorganize mentally. Eventually, I went through Clozemaster app and just went through 1000 sentences for a whole month, and listened to a lot of Japanese outside of that from Pimsleur and Glossika. After that month, my comprehension of japanese grammar got so much more 'intuitive' and now I rarely think about the grammar anymore I just see it and 'understand' without translating in my head. Same thing happened with the words, I saw and heard them enough after that month, that words I'd known for years finally 'clicked' and I didn't need a moment to translate each word I saw mentally anymore.\n\nSo basically: a LOT of exposure. Reading and listening are the fastest ways to get a bunch of grammar and vocabulary repeatedly, but any exposure will likely work. You just need a LOT. I think people often suggest immersion because you are exposing yourself to the language nonstop in immersion so you get through the 'stop translating' stage at a certain point.\n\nSpeaking/writing a lot can also help, if you're speaking/writing correctly without errors. Those old FSI courses included a lot of drills, which people tend to find boring, but if you drill the correct pattern long enough you do 'expose' yourself to the pattern enough to just say it intuitively without thinking of the translation.", "created_utc": "1662745764.0", "edited": "1662745981.0", "id": "inr5kld", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9d7hp", "parent_id": "t3_x9d7hp", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm social with friends but not much.

I already watched tv, so I started watching more cdramas, and eventually more cdramas in chinese without english subs. I already liked audiobooks and audio dramas, so I eventually switched to listening to chinese ones (first with english subs then with no subs). I already played video games, so I switched some to play in japanese. Already read comics, so now I read some chinese and japanese one.

I already had time for my hobbies so it wasn't as hard to carve new time in for them in different languages. \n\nI also find audio files, and audio flashcards, to be really useful for the more study oriented immersion. I can play target language/english/target language audio from Glossika, from Clozemaster, from youtube videos etc, when I'm working or walking or driving or cleaning. Audio is easier to squeeze in time for, compared to SRS programs where I have to look at a screen constantly or books I can't multitask while reading.

A good mnemonic would be a story to help you remember meaning and pronunciation based on the kana (and later kanji). So \u304dki looks like a \"key.\" \u3053 ko looks like a \"co\"ke bottle. Etc. Mnemonics sometimes help with remembering in a way just memorize drilling may not. Some people also find it helps to make up their own personal mnemonics, based on a real place you know/thing personal in your life, which helps you remember it better. So for me it might be \u304d looks like sora's key from kingdom hearts, one of my favorite games. Or it looks like the key to my house and picture that key in my mind when looking at the hiragana.\n\nThere's books, and free anki and memrise decks, and websites, for mnemonics for learning Kanji. Any SRS program is going to be the fastest way to learn the Kanji, if you enjoy/can get yourself to use an srs program and study regularly. Anki is an srs program, so is memrise, etc. I personally can't reliably study srs flashcard programs so I didn't use them, but they work Fast if you can get yourself to. SRS studying is basically repetition at the most efficient intervals to learn quickly, and it does tend to speed things along.\n\nFor Kanji specifically, you may want to look up and read some short articles that explain radicals. You should only need a few hours for this. Just get familiar with the idea Kanji are built up of a bit over 200 radicals (smaller symbolic images), that some Kanji are image symbols of what they mean, while other Kanji are just a combo of maybe some radical that indicates meaning and some radical that does not, and that Kanji are sometimes pronounced multiple ways depending on the word they are in. When you get used to the radicals that build Kanji, it's easier to look at new Kanji and break down the radicals that make it up so it's easier to visually remember. \n\n If a resource includes mnemonics then it tends to stick \"faster\" in your mind. So if you use anki then web search \"anki Kanji mnemonics\" or if you use memrise then search \"memrise Kanji mnemonics\" and find a user made course. A free site named kanjikoohi has a bunch of user submitted mnemonics (stories) to help you remember Kanji meaning and pronunciation, you may want to check that site out. The book Remember the Kanji by Heisig is what a lot of people use, but you have to make up most of your own mnemonics so I used mostly other sources.\n\nI personally found JapaneseAudioLessons.com has published books for learning Kanji, which have fully written mnemonics for Kanji meanings and pronunciations. They are my favorite books for learning Kanji. I also used a Tuttle Kanji book with about 300 Kanji as a beginner, and found it made the explanations memorable enough I managed to learn what was in the book. There's also the book Kodansha Kanji Learners Guide, but it doesn't have mnemonics just information on many Kanji. Still, it's a resource many have found useful. \n\nI learned 500 Kanji with a mnemonics memrise deck (nukemarines sgjl decks) , then went and learned chinese and learned 1500 hanzi (which is similar to Kanji) with a Tuttle mnemonics book for hanzi then an anki mnemonics deck in a handful of months. Then I learned the rest I know reading, and when I came back to japanese there is enough overlap of similar hanzi to Kanji and radicals that make up both, that now I find Kanji very easy to learn either as a similar-to-cognate to the similar hanzi, or with mnemonics since I'm better at making them now. I went a weird way about it, but basically if I'd sat down and read Kanji mnemonic books more I would have picked up Kanji faster than I initially did.", "created_utc": "1662679784.0", "edited": "False", "id": "innnshc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9bre7", "parent_id": "t3_x9bre7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Your study plan sounds great! I never did I suppose \"pure\" refold, but like you I switched from another study plan (just classroom stuff) to a more immersion based approach. You doing SRS flashcards is a good shift, it will fill in any gaps in knowledge you have of the basics and get you prepared for immersing in shows/books for native speakers quickly. When I switched, I just used word lists/sentence lists and studied in an SRS timing way, and I could switch to native stuff within 5 months. Your plan sounds very well set up so you should be all set to transition to immersion content you like quickly.\n\nSome materials you may find useful:\n\n- try out the Comprehensible Input French channel on youtube instead of Alice Ayel, its also good immersion content but that channel has playlists for different levels so you can explore and find a place to start that's more challenging for you.\n\n- Ayan Academy on youtube has Le Francais Par Le Methode Nature text/audio, its a textbook that was designed to teach through comprehensible input enough to get a learner prepared for native materials afterwards. Its a bit over half a century old, but I love those types of books. Back when I started French I read 300 pages of it, and it boosted my reading comprehension so much that after that I never had to conciously make time to study reading again. I was to the level I could just read extensively. I was doing reading outside the textbook too beforehand, and some Clozemaster (so SRS), but if I could go back I would've browsed through the book earlier.\n\n- Once you feel ready for more French reading, some things that may be easier to start with: more graded readers, news articles (since you'll be familiar with the nouns places/countries/people), wikipedia, non fiction texts (again a lot of science words will be cognates/similar to english and you may be familiar with the nouns/subjects already), french versions of things you've read/seen in english (because you have context already) such as french lets plays of video games you like etc. Video wise, same thing, the content you have prior context for will be easier than things which are brand new to you. \n\n- Trying to comprehend brand new text/shows is a good way to get a feel for your language level. If you watch a brand new french show and can follow the main idea: you're making progress. If you watch something brand new and follow the main idea and catch a lot of details, more progress, etc. \n\n- Duolingo French may have up to 3000 words (some courses have less), so once you feel comfortable with a lot of common words, it may have diminishing returns.

I love japanese's very logical grammar (seems easier than trying to learn english grammar in the opposite direction), but how it decides to approach topics is so unintuitive to how I usually think. The focus is on verb over subject or object which are more often implied, but even more important is its quite normal to talk around various topics instead of directly just due to being polite. Instead of saying \"Sorry, I can't X\" you might say \"A little...\" and its implied 'what' is a little 'difficult' and therefore you 'can't' do it/go to it etc. Chinese is more direct like english a lot of the time, so while I might omit a subject or object to talk faster, its not impolite to clarify and just directly ask \"what's little? who did you mean?\" I can just say, like in english, \"sorry, x is difficult\" or \"sorry, I can't X.\" Some topics are approached differently (so different sorts of set phrases/conversations) but to my mind they still seem fairly direct and so I adapt to them easier. \n\nI always used to think japanese was so difficult for me, because it took me so long to get used to automatically interpreting the different grammar structure.

I have to think about everything in a very different way than I normally do. That is true to a degree with every language, but its a much harder task for me in japanese. So I suppose studying japanese makes me much more aware of how many different less direct ways there are to approach topics. And also, the easier part lol, how much of a topic doesn't actually need to be restated over and over to have a discussion (how much information you can cut out and still make a point, versus english where our sentences require we bring up topics again and again more).", "created_utc": "1662560066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ingbibp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7m8tj", "parent_id": "t3_x7m8tj", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Feel free to ignore this if it doesn't help lol! Maybe consider your motivations for all 3? There may be some motivations you know you want to do for sure in life, so those languages you'll be more likely to study long enough to be able to ultimately do what you want to do. And if you have any motivation you want to do soon, that might help you study the language more often. For me chinese had so many novels/shows I was interested in, that I wanted to read or see so bad I didn't want to wait for translations (or tolerate sucky translations or nothing) so that really motivated me. Also so much media is free online in chinese, that if i could understand i could go find tons of cool stuff that seemingly never ends lol (versus japanese where i like many things but most are paid only and harder to get access to which demotivates me). Whereas Korean, I can usually find good translations of what I like so I rarely feel I need to learn. And Japanese, there's good game translations (usually) so it's only because I Do really want to understand certain nuances that I kept getting motivated, but at the same time it's not urgent since there's good translations \"until I get better at japanese\" so I take longer to study lol. Though Yakuza Ishin motivated me recently since I wanted to play the samurai yakuza game and it has no English translation, so ive played it in chunks lately which motivates me to study so the next times I play it's easier lol. \n\nIf you don't have any \"big\" motivations, maybe just explore media and culture in the languages: video games made in those countries, movies, songs, books in genres you like, books in unfamiliar new genres, short stories, food, chatting with people on language exchange apps, watching YouTube videos of vloggers who live there and maybe share information about their life there or the social issues they notice. It can be all with English subs and translations! Just stuff so you can explore, see what things interest you. See if something makes you feel you REALLY want to learn so you can understand and connect better than through translation, or you find something you like and realize there's more if you didn't need translations to rely on etc. (Like Japanese, I normally find musicals boring but I find Japanese ones cool, and a lot are online free but no translations! So it motivates me to want to improve my listening skills). And if youre watching vloggers and commenting, or on exchange apps, you may make friends and that may ultimately motivate you toward a particular language. \n\nIts also truly okay to just try learning each one for a week or month each, and see which one you like studying most. No one says you can't eventually learn them all. And whichever one you stick with first might just be what you care about most for now. Later you can change your mind - I did with japanese and chinese and French lol, I kept switching between them. But I eventually did end up learning them all and still keep learning them. I never thought I'd find chinese easier than japanese, find it more interesting to study than French, and have that be my best language lol, but surprises happen. I never thought I'd even care about French, it was just supposed to be a test to see if I could even learn Any single thing in another language since I failed with so many languages before French. So if you do want to dabble for a while, see what you like or don't like for now, see what works best for you, you can. You don't have to immediately commit to korean for 6 years starting now, no other language until korean is \"perfect\" etc. You could also just do whatever clicks best for you as you explore.", "created_utc": "1662523037.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ineovip", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x7srom", "parent_id": "t1_inen4ox", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Idk if this counts. I dropped learning Japanese after 2.5 years, because in that time it took me that long to even get to reading simple manga and following the overall gist main idea with a dictionary. Progress was so slow to me, it demotivated. I put in effort that never seemed to pay off. 2 years later, I actually picked it back up. Now I study it on and off about every 6 months so it's probably never gonna be dropped \"permanently\" again. I learned some chinese in the in between 2 years, and partly what changed was I learned Really Effective study plans for myself when handling chinese. So when I went back to japanese, I had much better goals, a much better idea of how to see progress quicker, and reading Kanji was no longer a hellscape (since I knew a lot of Chinese hanzi). Kanji are still harder, because they have multiple pronunciations and I don't know them or how to tackle remembering Multiple. Japanese is still harder, because grammar is so difficult for me that it makes it my slowest language to make progress in. But now I play to my strengths - audio only study materials that cover a lot of grammar work well for me, reading material with audio like caption audio dramas on youtube work good for me to teach me Kanji pronunciation. I can actually DO my goal for learning Japanese now - play video games in Japanese - so ultimately anything I do now is polish to make that less strenuous, or to do other Bonus things in Japanese. So it's easier to motivate myself since when I am sick of studying, I can play a Japanese game and remember Why I wanted to learn and what I wanted to do. And taking 6 months off regularly just happens now - whenever I'm unmotivated I just stop, whenever I get the urge to play Japanese games again I get motivated to study. I'll probably get to milestones slower than people who study more, but I see progress so I'm happy each time now.\n\nDropped Spanish for real. I studied it in middle school got a bad grade and never studied again in a class. I tried it in college cause I wanted to test out LanguageTransfer (I ended up loving LanguageTransfer). I learned some of the sound, but ultimately the little audio lessons just made my established French better since I got better at distinguishing French from Spanish when listening or thinking in my head, but learned no actual Spanish. I dropped Spanish cause I was studying japanese and French and had NO time, especially no time to see a beginner language like Spanish get the time it needed for me to make progress. I occasionally try to read in Spanish nowadays, which I actually can manage to when it's like nonfiction textbooks (which I assume is because of French cognates and Latin root words being in textbook type subjects more). But I never really got to study it more than 2 months, and except for more ideas of \"let's test some learning material to see if it even works\" I don't think I'll probably engage with Spanish much. I guess I dropped it due to time, and just no huge motivating interest compelling me to come back to learning it. Whereas French, I wanted to read some specific French books which motivated me to come back until I managed that. Japanese, I wanted to play my favorite games in their original Japanese, and until I play every one at full comprehension I'll still for sure have motivation to keep studying lol. And Chinese, it started with wanting to read a book, then I found many other things to motivate me. So I always have reasons to keep studying within every few months at least. \n\nDropped Russian. I learned some to talk to a partners family, baby brother, and roommates. When we broke up I had no more pressing need to learn or understand Russian. Also I was busy so it was an easy choice to drop it. I did like some Russian literature but not enough to make time for study.\n\nDropped Italian. Like Spanish, I only study it mostly to see if a particular study tool \"works.\" Half my family only speaks Italian though so ultimately I want to pick it back up one day. I only seem to get motivated when I really want to read a book though apparently (or in Japanese case, a game), so I probably won't focus fully on Italian until whenever I get really into some Italian book to make myself buckle down enough to study consistently.\n\nDropped korean and Thai. Thai is so cool, I just do not have time. Korean I get the urge to learn whenever I watch a lot in Korean and get curious what nuances/politeness levels/slang I'm missing cause a lot always changes in translation. But I do not have time, and just am not motivated enough to study Korean longer than a single curious day once in a while. I can tell for me Korean would be as hard as Japanese, and I do NOT have time for Japanese now, so I definitely don't have time for a language I have no \"necessary\" goals in.

The audio files with chinese and English sentences may be useful to you, and also Glossika Chinese sentences audio may be useful. Glossika is very suited to learning listening/speaking primarily. The Chinese Spoonfed anki deck has audio and characters/pinyin, so you could just mainly focus on pinyin/audio and still see the characters frequently to just get some exposure. So later when typing you'll know what hanzi looks familiar for what you're trying to type, or if you end up wanting to learn hanzi later. \n\nIf you truly want to learn chinese only for speaking, audio only resources may be useful to you. There's not a lot of text resources for pinyin that go very far into actual proficiency speaking, and if you plan to use text resources then you'll want to pick up some hanzi familiarity for stuff beyond the very beginner materials. Hanzi aren't as hard as they look, but they do feel a bit harder if you wait to learn them until later. For learning vocabulary in some ways hanzi are way easier than pinyin, because hanzi have radicals that often tell you the pronunciation and give you a hint at meaning. Whereas if you see/hear gu3jia4 you don't know if it's \u80a1\u4ef7share price or \u9aa8\u67b6skeleton (today Google mistranslated it as share price since it's the more common word with that pinyin to Google lol). If you see pinyin/hear shi4 you don't know if it's \u5ba4, \u4e16, \u58eb, \u662f\uff0cetc. In listening you eventually have to guess and learn to tell when it's which word, so for listening you'd have the ambiguity anyway. But as far as learning from reading material goes, ultimately stuff with only pinyin will get confusing as these situations come up. Where if you start learning hanzi, learning with reading material ultimately adds up and teaches both pronunciation and the look of hanzi so later when you see new words you see familiar parts helping you guess new word meanings and pronunciations. Down the road, if you do feel like learning hanzi, you may find it makes some learning materials easier to use.

I love seeing progress, and seeing your reading list in order of difficulty is really helpful! I love the Heavenly Path site and reading suggestions on there.\n\nMay I ask what reading level stuff might be helpful for me, kind of based on what you've read? I think I may need some more basic vocabulary, as I can read stuff like  \u6492\u91ce and \u7b11\u732b\u65e5\u8bb0 easily, but when I have 'easier' stuff with very few sentences per paragraph for context like \u6211\u7537\u670b\u53cb\u597d\u50cf\u6709\u75c5 I struggle. I can read stuff like \u9547\u9b42 fine without a dictionary, and I've read the first 20 chapters digitally several times, first 100 pages in print a few times. I've learned a lot of my earlier vocabulary from reading \u9547\u9b42, \u5929\u6daf\u5ba2, and  \u9ed8\u8bfb by priest so its possible I just know the author's vocabulary well, and priest tends to give denser paragraphs which I find easier when reading. But I read stuff at priest's writing level slower than stuff like \u6492\u91ce, so I'm wondering if maybe I need to be reading something at a slightly easier level to build up my reading speed a bit. \n\nThose tests you linked gave me HSK 5/6, and about 2000 characters known. From personal experience I know my vocabulary veers away from HSK after 4, and into whatever I'd read a lot of, so I have some HSK type words I know I'm missing while some stuff without much overlap with HSK I can read fine. 2000 is probably a fair estimate of hanzi I know. Thank you for sharing those sites, and your results! Its nice to see those kinds of benchmarks as people make progress!\n\nI don't know if reading the intermediate level stuff would help me more, since I find it more difficult than 'upper intermediate' stuff.

Then when you go back to novels the intensive reading word-lookups will not feel as often and you will feel you're picking up words faster with less look-up pauses in general. \n\nOr switch to an easier novel where you need to look up less words. I usually vary between something easier for me to read so I can extensively read or intensively look up some words as desired, then a harder to read novel where I look up a lot of words but run into words I figure I'll need to start getting familiar with by looking up often so I can learn them eventually. Easier reading that's more comprehensible, tends to be easier to learn from and reinforces the words/grammar you already recognize and know.

But I need roughly '2000' common words I recognize in a language to start learning from reading, which is what I prefer to do. So I spend a couple weeks going through 1000 common word SRS cards (in memrise/anki/clozemaster, with audio if possible, in sentences or not doesn't matter, or even just a word list and no cards). Daily review are optional, the goal is to get through as many new cards per day as I can. I like memrise user-made courses, because memrise makes me review a little but lets me skip a LOT so I can prioritize covering 1000 words quickly. \n\nThen I push into graded readers, comics, reading subtitles in shows I've seen already in a language I know. A few months later I get frustrated I'm only comprehending a certain amount, cram 1000 more common words in SRS or with a common word list. After 1-2 weeks, I go back to reading and watching stuff. At this point i've probably moved on from learner-made graded readers and videos, and I'm watching/reading more stuff for natives. I usually look up words every 5 minutes or so, or 5 words a page or so, especially at the beginning when I think a word is critical for understanding or I'm curious about it. Then over time I looked up less words. Since I looked up words, I end up reviewing words I didn't learn fully during the flashcard SRS period (since I skipped reviews). And its funner for me to learn the words while engaging with media. This works for me, but it does still require flashcards or an app or word list for 2000 words, and it has so little review because I can't do flashcards long.

Do you already have a trip planned to a place that speaks X? Do you already watch shows, listen to music, read authors, play games from X speaking country? Pick that one. If you don't engage with any of these languages, start. You can still use english, just explore. Find subtitled games, shows, find books translated to english (or parallel texts in that language and english), find comics, find audio dramas with english subs, find music. Find food recipes and make them, read some history books and grammar books that discuss the languages. You will figure out which one(s) you care about enough to learn. Then once you feel you really want to learn a language, to do those things IN the language (and to do the many things you cannot do until you understand the language), start learning. It's pretty easy to pick which language to learn when you're already adjacent to it, when learning it would make what you want to do easier.\n\nI started learning japanese because my favorite video games are in japanese, and one day I want to understand them before translation and localization changes. I started learning, did it for 3 years and just barely managed to start understanding manga toward the end of it, then gave up. Whenever I played video games, that passion came back. 2 years later I got into video games again with Nier Automata, got motivated to learn again. That year I was able to play Kingdom Hearts 2 in japanese and notice some nuances that were lost in english translation, watch some Final Fantasy X scenes in japanese, and this year I've been playing the Yakuza games and its been super fun noticing the difference between the japanese they say and english localization subtitles! I bought Yakuza Ishin, and am playing it, and I would never have been able to play it if I hadn't started studying japanese. Because the game was never translated to english. Through that initial passion, I've also found japanese authors I like and am timidly trying out novels. I've found musicians I like, read into a lot of culture and history and social issue things. One small thing I wanted to do led to a lot more.\n\nWith Chinese, I started it 3 years into japanese (then gave up japanese for 2 years). I watched cdrama Guardian with english subs, loved it because it was all the things I loved. I found out it had a novel with more stuff, supernatural genre instead of sci fi, and it was not fully translated (and the fan translation at the time was rough and omited many lines). So I started learning Chinese, because I really wanted to read that specific novel. Months into learning I wanted to watch cdramas that had no english subs, which expanded my motivations. Then I got on language exchange apps, talked poorly and got motivated to get better, made friends I still keep up with, and started caring about speaking decently. I found manhua (comics) and they were simple and I could read them! Within 8 months! I got motivated cause it was going easier and faster than japanese ever did. I got into audiobooks and audio dramas, since chinese has so many free novels/audiobooks/audiodramas/show dramas online. I had endless interesting content I wanted to consume, and the more I knew chinese the less I needed to hope for a fan to decide to make a decent translation. A little over a year in I could start watching new airing shows I was anticipating before waiting for english subs to drop. Now its almost 3 years in and I'm getting really into audiobooks now that they're doable. \n\nChinese online media feels as plentiful as english internet media, so there's a lot of cool stuff that becomes accessible when you learn it. And there's weibo even, which I find fun to see what people are trending compared to twitter or when I'm looking for info on a new show. And through learning chinese, I made a lot of friends who speak chinese, friends also learning, friends also into the same stuff that's coming out in chinese and help me find things I like. I found a lot of fun hobbies and met a lot of wonderful people I'm glad are in my life. When all I intended to do was read a single book. When I started I had no idea why I'd be motivated to keep learning, but if it matters to you, you'll eventually keep learning. Even if you drop it and come back on and off until something finally clicks and you get into it again.\n\nAnd Korean! I'm not learning now, for many reasons and one being japanese and chinese require a lot of time. But my friends who are into chinese media are also often into korean media, and every so often they suck me in and I end up wondering what lyrics mean and feel like I need to Learn because unlike my friends I can't sing along unless I know what the sounds mean lol. Or I watch a show with them and notice there's titles and formality but I don't know what it means and the english subs omit the information.

So even though I \"don't think about how to say it anymore\" I still SHOULD be taking time to sit down, look up chinese sentence patterns, and practice saying and writing them correctly. The next time I focus on improving production skills I plan to do that more. For me, reading and listening helped some automaticity, but not for everything and not to a degree I'm confident what I'm saying sounds correct (because plenty of it still is weirdly worded).", "created_utc": "1662178909.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imw07xd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x41z54", "parent_id": "t3_x41z54", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thanks for this post, I'm going to start doing this with Japanese novels I'm trying to read!", "created_utc": "1662086018.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imqw1q2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x399a7", "parent_id": "t3_x399a7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I do think it makes things easier. But being a perfectionist in general can be hard. I think to be, and I got into language learning partially because I have to ignore my perfectionist tendency to constantly review material until it's perfectly memorized before moving on, and have to ignore my urge to not engage with content until I understand everything perfectly. Language learning makes me continue moving forward to things that challenge me as long as I overall got a grasp of the thing before (even if not perfectly) and I have to practice comprehending by listening to/reading/having conversations where I absolutely cannot understand everything. Over time I understand more, and it's motivating. And ultimately in my native language i don't actually understand everything (there's always the chance some words I don't know or topic like aerodynamics will come up etc). So I try my best in a way to treat languages like my native one - I read things I didn't perfectly grasp as a child (read above my reading level), I watched all kinds of shows and must have picked up vocabulary over time (I remember guessing the definition of melancholy from context at age 12 then looking it up in google)Google, I had plenty of conversations from 2 onwards into now as an adult where I ask \"Wait, what is X?\" So I try to be less demanding of perfection with my learning, because I'm not truly perfect when I learned my native language either.\n\nWhat actually seems to get easier: as an adult I think we are just better at making specific measurable goals, smaller goals to work toward big goals, gauging our own progress and what we need to work on, testing if something works to help build toward our goals or not. As a high schooler when I studied german, japanese, Chinese, I had no specific goals just the vague \"oh I want to learn them!\" I learned barely anything, certainly not enough to do anything useful in any of those languages. As an adult, I found a French book and wanted to read it, realized I had a specific goal \"to read French at this reading difficulty\" and then could look up specific advice for my goal, look up what other people did, could copy other people's methods and see what worked for me and what didn't as a result I made significant progress in 6 months, way more than the amount of progress I made in 2 years of German in high school. In 2 years, even fumbling, as an adult I made huge progress in French and accomplished the key goal of reading whatever I wanted. When I started my third language as an adult, Chinese, I made way faster progress than other people's timeline suggested I would. In 2 years i got to the language level i figured would take me 4 years, and in 3 years ive gotten to a point i thought would have taken 6. \n\nI think a huge part of it is that I knew what study methods, and what short and long term goals, worked for me and how to check if my method was working or needed to be changed. Since you've already studied languages before, you likely have a better idea now of what specific goals motivate you and what other ones don't (or what vague ones don't), you probably know what study methods work for you that you can regularly do consistently versus hate, what methods caused you progress before versus what seemed to barely help your language skills. So now you can cut out a lot of the wasted bumbling time you spent in prior languages just figuring out how to study in a way that worked versus didn't. With each successive language I think that \"time unsure what to do\" gets smaller, speeding up language learning.", "created_utc": "1662085893.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imqvs02", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x307dl", "parent_id": "t3_x307dl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "So the \"Fluent in 3 months\" books don't actually make you fluent (that takes years), but when I've flipped through them in bookstores they do seem geared to teach you enough to have basic conversations quite early since they're focused on that.\n\nWhat I think might help you most (that is free): \n\n* look up a pronunciation guide for your target language (a website with audio or a youtube video). Go through it, try to pronounce like them, try to hear the proper sounds, watch more videos/read more sites on pronunciation as needed, look up mouth placements for sounds as needed. Spend a week or two on this, studying pronunciation even a little bit helps so much with speaking/listening down the road.\n\n* Study this [300 words list](https://funwithlanguages.tumblr.com/post/105572981908/you-can-say-a-surprising-amount-with-300-words). Some languages have a user made memrise or anki course for these words. Its made to help you get speaking/writing quickly, and should prepare you to have basic conversations where you'll just need to look up some key words ahead of time on whatever topic you want to discuss. So what extra words you look up, will depend on what you want to say/write. I studied this when I was learning french, and within a few months I could write/say a lot of basic stuff, which was awesome to me because I'd studied German for 2 years and NEVER had been able to discuss as much. \n\n* Take a beginner class, or free MOOC on Coursera, or watch youtube beginner lessons, or look up a \"grammar guide for beginners/grammar guide summary\" online and read a website, or look up a beginner learning podcast like LanguageTransfer or Coffee Break French, or find a Teach Yourself book pdf. Basically, do something to go learn the basic ways to express the nouns I, you, he, she, it, they, you, you all. The basic ways to conjugate \"to be\" and \"to have\" and \"to go\" verbs. And the basic way to make past tense, present tense, future tense verbs. The verbs you will want to focus on are whatever verbs were in the 300 word list. This basic grammar will make it possible to say \"I went home, now I'm going to see my friend, then I will get drinks with them.\" You will be able to say a lot of ideas in a basic way, which is motivating if you find speaking early to be motivating. A good beginner class will cover this by default, a good beginner book/website/video also will.\n\n* After that, move on to learning vocabulary however you would like. Either using 2000 most common word lists (which might help quicker with comprehending others) or based on looking words up you want to be able to say (so based on what you want to talk about). If speaking motivates you, get on a language exchange app like Hellotalk or Tandem and start regularly chatting with people. Look up words people use when you don't know them, and look up words you don't know when you want to talk about them. You'll improve production skills and be learning based on what you want to talk about.\n\n* To practice speaking before any other study/regardless of any other study: shadow audio. My japanese teacher had us do this from week 1 of learning, we would shadow all audio of vocabulary as we studied new words, shadow the dialogues at the beginning of every book chapter. After shadowing, we would record ourselves attempting to sound just like the vocabulary/dialogue audio, and be graded on how close we sounded. (She would also have us record ourselves saying our written assignments out loud and grade us on pronunciation- so you could do this as you learn new vocabulary/grammar and write practice sentences if you want). Shadowing, and recording yourself saying it afterward to hear what mistakes you still make and then redo it and fix it, helps a lot with pronunciation. You can do it as long as you have audio. Textbook or website lesson dialogues work great for this, just because you may learn some new vocabulary/grammar too. But anything in the language will work. To shadow: listen to the audio, and attempt to say it right after they do and at the same time if you can. Keep doing that, and try to say it as similarly to them as you can. When you feel confident, say it without the audio playing now and record yourself. Listen back to the recording, and compare your voice to the recording, notice what you did right and wrong. Then repeat. \n\nAnd finally: you do NOT have to \"speak early\" if you don't want to. You can also speak early if its fun, and you'll find like all language skills that every so many months you are learning new stuff about speaking and studying new things. I spoke at 3 months in french then didn't speak again much until 2 years later after some intensive pronunciation study about 2 years in. For chinese I spoke in 5 months, then focused on speaking about every 6 months for a little while before switching to other things again. Japanese focused on speaking immediately week 1 because I took a class where my teacher had us shadow audio and pronunciation CONSTANTLY and speak aloud any written assignment - it improved my pronunciation and listening skills immensely, but was very hard. Then after that class I did no speaking again for 4 years. So when and how much and how often you choose to focus on speaking is up to you, and it will work out fine whichever way you do it.", "created_utc": "1662049017.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imode21", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3b1vd", "parent_id": "t3_x3b1vd", "score": "73", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "In my dream world, more textbooks designed to teach through reading, 2000 common words and grammar, like English by the Nature Method would exist.

This will probably start as graded readers, then easier novels and informational articles and genres you already are familiar with.\n\n So novels made for younger people/casual readers with less detail, articles on topics you already are familiar with or news you keep up on, genres you already read regularly or watch regularly (so you have a good chance of guessing the context of a scene), and written material based on shoes/games you are familiar with (so you already know names and the general world and possibly plot). If you don't want to look words up until you know several thousand, you want to be in a frame of mind where you accept it is okay not to know every detail. If you read a sentence like \"She walked x to the bed, the sky X, she jumped\" can you be okay with that amount of information. You know the main idea, which is she walked to a bed, something happened which made her jump (probably). If you can understand this much of each paragraph, you'll be able to follow the main idea of a piece of writing, and you'll be able to learn at least some new words from context each time you read. So over time, you'll pick up more words and be able to move to higher difficulty reading material. This is what I did for French and Chinese and it worked well. I did this with materials I had 98% comprehension with, but also with novels I probably had somewhat less comprehension of. There's some degree of learning by context people can do even when comprehension is under 98%, if they can follow some of the main ideas still (so they understand enough context to figure out some new words as they read), and if they can tolerate the degree of ambiguity. It can feel frustrating dealing with the ambiguity of not completely understanding something, so a lot of people opt to look up every or nearly every word they don't know instead. I am pretty tolerant of ambiguity but mileage may vary depending on the person, on how much a person needs to comprehend to tolerate reading a given material.\n\nYou can also still look up words when curious/when a word seems critical to learn and you just want to know it quicker, or when choosing to read stuff purposely above a reading level where you can follow the main idea, so that by looking up words in those reading materials you learn enough to start reading At That level without a dictionary. I did that too, every about 5 months, to learn some critical words I needed for context of higher level reading materials at a faster pace than I would've picked up the words otherwise.\n\nGenerally, learning 2000 common words will put you in a position where graded readers are comfortably readable without a dictionary/looking words up, articles on topics you know/easier novels/writing based on context you're familiar with (a genre you normally read or based on a show you've seen) will also be probably readable enough to \"follow the main idea\" without a dictionary. At 2000 words, most things that aren't graded readers will still feel less than 98% comprehensible so it will a bit hard during the first few months of reading. But for the most part, 2000 words is usually enough for a person to push into learning from context only and no longer having to look up words to make noticeable progress, if they're tired of looking up words/SRS etc. I only needed 1000 common words to do it with french, and chinese I needed 2000 words and about 1500 hanzi before it felt much easier to read things with less frequent or no word lookup.\n\nEdit: if you want to feel \"like\" a native speaker, who no longer has to look words up per page (at least not any more than you would in your native language), I've seen the numbers 7000-9000 words. Sometimes a bit higher like 15000. But based on some articles on reading, once a person reads 10,000 pages (or 52 books I've seen a few articles with different ways to measure the amount of words), they will pick up around 7000-9000 words in a target language and feel as comfortable reading in the target language as a native speaker. So for reading purposes you probably don't have to learn 15k words to feel comfortable. Reading articles say people tend to feel comfortable in the 7000-9000 word range (and lower word ranges the more comfortable someone is with ambiguity).", "created_utc": "1661817432.0", "edited": "1661817634.0", "id": "imbm98w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x11cpo", "parent_id": "t3_x11cpo", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Try looking up some chinese grammar guide books, with examples of correct versus error sentences. I use Basic Patterns of Chinese Grammar, and currently Speed Up Your Chinese. These books go over a lot of sentence grammar, and common mistakes learners make so I can catch mistakes I'll tend to make then practice writing correct sentences instead.\n\nChinese grammar is easy, in my opinion... compared to Japanese, which I also study. And compared to French, which has so many more conjugations and I hate conjugations so Chinese is preferable to me. It's not the easiest grammar ever for an English speaker, and probably romance languages may seem easier to some people. But it's grammar is on the easier end compared to other \"harder\" langages that are said to take more time for English speakers to learn. The svo structure is the same, and when things are placed in different areas of the sentence than in English, the placement still seems comprehensible and understandable enough to an English speaker. Some of the parts of grammar which are less like English, it still only took maybe 5 months of reading regularly to just start intuitively understanding those grammar points I had initially felt were confusing.  I think Chinese grammar is fairly easy to read, once you practice doing it for a little while. The structure is similar enough to English in I think the kind of \"think things out\" way that it isn't too confusing.\n\nLearning to speak/write Chinese without needing to pause and translate to yourself, and being unsure if what you said is proper grammar? Normal. I find this part hard sometimes, and much harder when I'm speaking beyond simple conversations I have more regularly. I think this is partly a matter of practice, repetition, and saying/writing things correct long enough that it becomes habit. When I studied French I had the same problem, when I studied German I had the same problem. I would instinctively want to use English word order and grammar (especially the more of a beginner I was), and it took effort to practice correct grammar and word order and to catch mistakes and work on them. Chinese is about as hard for me as French on this front. It's still easier than Japanese for me, just because in chinese and French, due to grammar being less drastically different, I pick up the right way to say things faster. With Japanese, so much grammar is just very unlike how I normally would think to say things, so I have to put in a lot more effort to practice saying things right and correct grammar becomes automatic much slower. \n\nChinese is hard in the way all languages are somewhat hard to learn to correctly say automatically.

Then pick a language you want to improve, and pick a short term goal that will get you eventually to your long term goal of what you want to do in these languages.\n\nFor Hindi and Urdu, since you almost fully understand them already, you might already have listening and reading skills as good as you would like them. So maybe all you'd need to do is go have conversations on topics you want to be able to discuss, to put yourself in situations where you practice actively recalling words when speaking/writing that you already passively know. Maybe your writing is fine, it just has some grammar errors, and all you need is to find a tutor to help point out your grammar errors so you can correct them and practice writing them. There is probably not much you'll need to do for Urdu and Hindi, just find people to practice with to help transfer things you understand into things you can more easily use.", "created_utc": "1661571125.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilyjcf5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ww7ny6", "parent_id": "t3_ww7ny6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I also prefer reading. My reading skill is still above my listening skill, but there's a few things that improved my listening skill a lot. \n\n1. Listening Reading Method. You can look it up as there's a lot of details about it online. For simplicity's sake, the steps I do to help listening skill are: 1. I read along in my native language as I listen to the audiobook in my target language (this optional step helps acquire new vocabulary), 2. I read along in mandarin as I listen to the audiobook in mandarin (this helps my reading speed get faster and helps me hear the words), 3. I listen to the audiobook on its own (the more times I do this step the more I comprehend the audio). Since the text aid helps you parse the words and comprehend everything, listening afterward you already have enough context to eventually 'recognize' what you hear. Doing this for just 20 chapters of a novel I like helped my listening comprehension a TON. And there are so many free chinese audiobooks and webnovels, its really easy to find materials to use.\n\n2. Repeated listening. I either listened to something I had read before (which usually helped me comprehend it faster), or I would listen to something brand new like an audio drama I was interested in. I just listened to an audio file several times, in the background as I work or drive or walk etc. I noticed the more I listened, the more comprehensible the audio became. I did this for about a month, just playing audio several times before moving to the next chapter to do the same, and by the end of the month I could start listening to audiobooks at that level or below for pleasure. My listening comprehension got significantly better, so that I went from decent-reading skill but poor listening skill, to enough listening skill to follow the main points in audio materials of a similar level. It is super easy to do repeated listening, you do not need to give it your full attention and can play audio in the background. Listen to something that if you read the transcript you would be able to follow it, so that the words are ones you would know from reading. Materials that work for this: anything at your reading level or below, condensed audio of shows, podcasts, audio dramas, audiobooks, just anything that would be words similar to your reading level.\n\n3. Audio flashcards.  I had audio files in 30 minute chunks of the chinese spoonfed anki deck sentences, that played a sentence in mandarin, then in english, then in mandarin again. I played them while doing level grinding in video games, or while driving, walking, or when working when I wasn't too busy. Even without giving my full attention (like when playing video games while listening), I found myself improving. I think partly this worked because I already had a decent reading level, and so the audio was helping fill in any gaps in vocabulary I might have, and helping me get a listening comprehension of words/phrases I was already familiar with. This method is nice though because you can also use it to both improve listening comprehension, and study new words (though you may need to pay more attention if using it to learn new words). Any kind of audio learning material will work: Clozemaster app's radio mode works well for this, all Glossika audios work great for this, Chinese Spoonfed Anki deck audio files work great, any audio files of anki/SRS flashcards you've made work well, podcasts for learners work well if they're speaking in your target language half the time or more, comprehensible input audios work well. I use Glossika's Japanese audio files to study japanese right now and increase both my vocabulary and improve my listening skill and its been working well. I've used audio flashcards for mandarin and they helped a lot with helping me get better listening comprehension of a lot of words I already knew well from reading but just did not recognize very fast when listening.  \n\nOut of these methods, Listening Reading Method and Repeated Listening helped the most with my listening comprehension improvement. LR Method also increased my vocabulary a lot in general (and usually will if you do the step 1 part). Repeated listening in general, of anything you've read before, is going to help probably the most quickly and easiest. Because in theory you already \"know\" the words, since you've read them before. And so you can spend most of your time just listening several times as you do other things, gradually noticing increased listening comprehension. I tested if repeated listening would work for me after seeing a person learning korean who used that method a lot. I just started playing an audiobook chapter of something I'd read before, and listened to it maybe 5 times at work in the background that day. By time 3 I'd noticed I was picking up more details than before, and by the later listens I noticed I was managing to follow the plot. So that made me decide it was a valuable way to study for me. Audio Flashcards work well if you already utilize flashcards/SRS in your study plan, just because it may be as simple as turning some cards into audio or listening only before reading them.", "created_utc": "1661567328.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilybzrk", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wws7qs", "parent_id": "t3_wws7qs", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you use anki or memrise, a lot of users already have made free flashcard decks with 1000 common words etc. That is what I did for chinese, I just used some user's premade decks for 2000 words.

First I used the [300 word tumblr list](https://aspiringathena.tumblr.com/post/184631021887/300-basic-french-words-and-phrases), which helped a ton with learning words to help me talk about things. Then I studied from the 625 Fluent Forever list while also reading through a grammar guide summary online. Then I found a site with the most 5000 common words in french, with audio and translations and example sentences next to each word. For the first two lists, I would just print them out and read them over every few days for a month or two. For the last 5000 word list, I would visit the website and read through 500 or so each study session every few days (this would only take an hour or less), then after a few months I stopped checking the list. I had probably read through 2000 words by then. Then I moved on to reading in french, and looking up words as desired. So instead of making SRS decks, I just studied from lists in sort a timed review kind of fashion, which worked fine. If you make a deck you'll likely pick up the words faster.\n\nLearning the 1000-2000 most common words is probably going to be more useful for you than the Fluent Forever list. So since you're making a deck, I'd suggest just making a deck with the 1000 words. But in the end, the 625 words are useful as well and there's some overlap. So you can either study both or just skip the 625 word list.", "created_utc": "1661549868.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilxa3p7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wyduwr", "parent_id": "t3_wyduwr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Since you already know a lot of words in writing, you might want to try listening without any subs for a while.

Find a french audiobook you like and transcript/text of the book. Listen to the audiobook and follow along with the text. Do this on a per chapter basis or whatever you'd like. Then listen to the audio on its own, multiple times. I find it easier to just listen to say chapter 1 five times in a row, just playing it in the background as I work or when I happen to be driving. Repeated listening improves your listening comprehension. And if you use an audiobook, you'll get a ton of words in a shorter period of time than a show or movie which has more quiet moments. Also if you use an audiobook, you can look at the text the first time if its important to you to comprehend it the first time you listen. That said, you can skip the read along part if you want.

I've watched those until I got to a decent level of comprehension - I mainly used the Ayan Academy video's french videos, because I'd already read the book they use in the videos (the book got me from beginner to able-to-read-whatever in French so it really worked for me). Comprehensible input study materials are materials where you can comprehend what the language means without translation, and learn by engaging with the material and attempting to understand. Its one of my favorite types of study material.\n\nOther ways I've used videos/movies: I've read through grammar from a grammar guide summary (some free website), and studied 2000 common words (through memrise user made courses), then engaged with content for native speakers. \n\nThe prep work of reading a grammar guide and studying 2000 common words took about 5 months for Chinese - I spent 3 months learning 800 hanzi from a Tuttle book, then 1 month on a grammar guide, 1 month on 1000 words in a memrise deck. Then I immersed and looked up words, by watching shows and reading graded readers. Then later about 8 months into study, I learned the second batch of 1000 common words in memrise, and studied about 1000 more hanzi in a memrise deck.  \n\nThe middle period before month 8, my 'immersion' was learning from Dual Subtitle shows (like viki.com does dual subtitles of chinese/english, and a lot of youtube videos have hard subtitle chinese and english) and graded readers (mainly Mandarin Companion, Sinolingua, and Pleco graded readers). The second immersion period, which I'm still in, is reading webnovels and watching dramas in chinese. I just engage with chinese and look up words as needed for understanding, trying to learn words from context alone when it is possible. You can speed up vocabulary acquisition by looking up words more often than me,  by using SRS software like Anki or memrise or Clozemaster, and by looking up grammar questions when you don't understand a grammar point so you can get clarification sooner. I slowed down my progress a bit by not using SRS after the initial 2000 words, and only looking up 1-10 words a page/chapter read (or 1-20 words per episode watched). I prefer to learn through context, so I purposely limited my word lookup to only things necessary to clarify understanding. I started with simpler reading materials and shows: graded readers, then simple webnovels with smaller vocabularies, and for shows I started with genres I was familiar with (murder mystery/crime), romance slice of life (because it has simplest vocabulary), and shows I'd already seen with english subs (so I already knew a lot of context). As material became more comprehensible, I increased the difficulty of material I was engaging with so I would run into more unknown words to learn - increasing the reading level of webnovels I picked, and picking shows in genres I knew less words in. I am now at a point where I listen to audiobooks, audio dramas, read novels I've wanted to read for a while, and watch shows I want to watch. I rarely look up words anymore unless its a novel and a word is difficult for me to figure out from context. \n\nTools that help: click dictionary tools are great for reading (there's many apps/extensions/sites which provide this for free or for a cost), for shows there are tools to display dual subtitles or click-definitions for words (free app Idiom does this for youtube videos, Language Reactor extension does this for netflix, some sites have this feature built in like viki.com). I found watching something in the target language only, and just looking up words I didn't know that felt important, worked best for me. Once I got above the beginner stage, dual subtitles tended to hold me back because I ended up relying on english subs when I could instead be improving my target language comprehension skills. For me, I just downloaded Google Translate app and drew in/typed unknown words and hanzi when watching a show if I saw an unknown word or phrase I wanted to know the meaning of. You could also use another translator more suited to your target language. \n\nIf you want to use subtitles/transcripts to study, another thing that may be useful to you is to either make SRS cards of new words/sentences (if you like using SRS software). Or, what I've done, which is practice watching something with subs you understand (such as english), then watch it with target language subs, then watch it with no subtitles. Practicing watching with target language subtitles (or transcript) can help you practice reading as you listen, and watching with no subtitles helps you practice listening. I do this method primarily with audiobooks - I will listen along to something with a chinese text and click words I don't know for an english definition, then try listening with no text and practice listening skill alone. As a beginner, I would listen to chinese and follow along with a parallel text or english translation, then listen again with chinese text only, then listen with no text. It worked very well at improving my listening skills and vocabulary.", "created_utc": "1661369381.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilmv7pg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwjy4f", "parent_id": "t3_wwjy4f", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I don't think you did anything wrong.

Its for long term use when you neec medicine for ibsc daily. Basically I'm being treated long term for severe chronic constipation and amitiza is my prescription for managing it (like linzess is used). I'm primarily concerned with if something else would help in addition right now, since I've been significantly worse the past 6 weeks. Before this I was able to eat and function like a normal person while on amitiza, now im swelled 10 lbs and vomiting and in intense pain and barely able to hold down food and more meds/things than normal are needed to judt use the bathroom a little. \n\nThis is the best gi doctor I can get without driving 2 hours to UofM and I still haven't been referred. She already did colonoscopy and endoscopy in Fall I had no issues inside at all, so I was put on amitiza to keep decent motility so I could eat. I had worse issues with nonstop vomiting and pain in Fall and had additional meds for that, but stopped those in January when I got pretty much better gi issue wise except for the constipation which amitiza was treating fine until 6 weeks ago. I'm currently on the higher standard dose for amitiza of 24 mg. \n\nSince May of last year no over the counter laxatives worked (magnesium citrate, dulcolax, miralax) which is why in August I was put on reglan short term and lactulose (lactulose didnt work for me though) then colon preps because my entire system was full and needed to be unblocked. Then after colonoscopy in October amitiza alone was working and couldn't take reglan long term. Without amitiza I period cannot use the bathroom for a month, and I start vomiting within a week because I'm so full and unable to keep food down. I can't go to the ER now in case it's nothing, they only give me pain meds if it's constipation. ER would only be able to help if it was a blockage that required immediate intervention, and since I'm able to use the bathroom a bit it's not a blockage a hospital would likely treat. It's something just laxatives/prescriptions would be used for. I don't want to go to ER for 7-8/10 pain, wait hours, have them do xray as usual and give iv if my electrolytes need it (but my electrolytes have been stable since November so im probably fine), then havw them say I'm just constipated here's pain meds (if they think it's needed - but pain meds constipate) then I go home. I don't think they'd help as much as my doctor adjusting my meds could do something maybe. Or me doing something more on top. I'm worried if I go to ER they won't do anything more then I am doing at home. \n\nI can take 8 miralax doses a day but it doesn't work as well as prune juice and magnesium citrate in top of the amitiza. So I'd only want to try miralax on top of things if it's able to work in a more helpful way than the other options. If it just brings water to stool/bowels (which is what I thought it does), I think magnesium citrate works similarly.\n\n Thank you for your advice.

I'm 2 years in now and I can read print books if I'm familiar with the genre or author, manhua give me no problems, and I still read digitally wirh a click dictionary but I like learning from context so I don't always look up every unknown word. You likely can handle print books now, you know plenty to pick up stuff from context. Click dictionaries help for double checking meaning and pronunciation so if they don't bother you, you'll probably keep improving faster while you keep using them.

I am left handed, I don't do English letters the \"right direction\" when I write, and I found myself doing stroke order correct but stroke direction wrong (I'd start top bottom/left right strokes from the wrong direction). This affects my fast handwriting since the cursive ish style looks totally wrong, and affects dictionary apps being able go predict what hanzi I'm writing in. So if you're left handed and apps can't tell what you're writing or your more flowy hanzi look weird you might want to check if you're writing the up down/ left right starting from the correct direction. It doesnt effect the readability unless those situations happen but it does affect it. I need to practice writing more as I do those mistakes by default constantly if I don't think about it, just like in English I stopped writing letters the correct direction path as soon as school stopped making us practice in sheets with the little directions to trace. \n\nStroke order generally matters. There's some general rules worth knowing and following. They make writing the characters easier, and again looking them up the stroke order matters even if you're just writing them into a dictionary search like Pleco. There's a few hanzi with stroke order exceptions to the norm, and some where doing the stroke order the usual pattern will make them harder to write, so if you are following usual stroke order rules and your hanzi keeps looking wonky its worth looking up if it's got a particular stroke order. You can be readable without perfect stroke order (though at least generally following stroke order guidelines is going to make it easier to make the hanzi look proportionate), you can also look up words even if your stroke order is wrong (Google translate will correctly guess what you wrote, and if you just don't write it but still know stroke order guidelines you can still use them just when looking things up).", "created_utc": "1655130041.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic7fysr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vb7yun", "parent_id": "t3_vb7yun", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you've played games in English before I find them easier. If playing games feels to hard at first, you can search lets plays on youtube with Japanese title and Japanese word for lets play. I found the ratchet and clank games on youtube and they were easier to follow. For actually playing people tend to mention Pok\u00e9mon and animal crossing, maybe legend of Zelda. I personally think lets plays are easier to watch at first if you're going to look up a lot of words.\n\nI also think anything you have prior context for will be easier, so anything you've played in a language you know already. I played kingdom hearts 2 years into learning Japanese despite not knowing many Kanji or words (I knew maybe 2000 words). I knew kingdom hearts so well though that the actual gameplay and tasks,were easy, and I could guess what most dialogue was about so I could figure out some words and phrases even before I'd look anything up. I remember \u541b was the first word I learned from it because the twilight town gang kept being called it. After another several months of study, I was at a point where Final Fantasy VII and Persona 3 were playable in Japanese (I had played them in English before) but they're really text heavy compared to kingdom hearts so I remember it took me 1 hour just to get through the opening explanation and to the save point in persona 3 because i tried to read everything and my reading speed was slow. Knowing the context already would mean you could speed past those parts if you just need to save, which is going to be less frustrating. And then again, let's plays and video cutscene movies on YouTube, and Japanese scripts online, may be easier at first. There's Japanese Gengo and Japanese Game Grammar youtube channels that break down Japanese in games as they play, and Japanese lets players with closed captions.\n\nThat said, I had a friend who knew 1000-2000 words from classes, got Final Fantasy Type 0 in Japanese, and learned to read and read Fast by playing that game and trying to follow the directions and quick dialogues. They hadn't played it before, and while they said it was real hard at first, they beat the game and learned a ton from it. After that they played other Japanese games with more ease and got into translating novels. So if you're a jump in and do it type learner, it's achievable to just jump right into playing what you want and learn from that.", "created_utc": "1655126812.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic79byl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v6ie5z", "parent_id": "t3_v6ie5z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "It is feasible to achieve your goals with self study. Speed at which you achieved them will in part be affected by how good your study plan is. When I studied Japanese at first I had an awful study plan with no structure for how to keep making myself regularly learn progressively new material for 2 years, so it wasn't until year 2 when I made better study plans that I improved faster. With chinese I knew my specific goals (and it's great you know yours) and studied with those in mind and was able to watch shows with no subs within 2 years and read novels without a dictionary within 2 years. So if you're really adamant about timeline I would recommend trying to study To Do your goal activities and to try to do your goal activities regularly (so you practice, and see what areas you're still weak in so you can make plans for them), and look up how other people achieved being able to do the goal activities. I know some people recommend comprehensible input learning but it is not the only method, and it can be done with other methods if it does work for you, and whatever study plan of various activities Works Best for You will be the fastest. For example I take 10 minutes a srs flashcard in an app per one study session, so I only use flashcards in the beginning of study to grind a bunch of common words - whereas some people are very time efficient with it and use flashcards for several thousand words.. I find reading a grammar guide summary asap for some preparation of what I'll see later helps me, for some people going into grammar too early or too much makes things more confusing. Find what study methods work for you. \n\nNow how long is realistic? FSI suggests 2,200 study hours to learn Japanese. Now they mean class hours so there's probably additional self study time, but to just be really general at estimating let's just guess that at 2,200 hours you'll probably be able to do your goal activities with decent comprehension if not perfect. If you want to do your goal activities in 3 years? Then you need to study around an average of 2 hours a day. If you want to do it in 2 years, study more hours on average per day. If you are okay with it taking 4-5 years you may need less study time per day. People who study 5+ hours a day are carving a lot of time out, but with a language that takes as many study hours as Japanese it's a good way to get to desired progress in less days/years. And once a person reaches that number of recommended hours they may find they still have X various things they want to do Better than they currently can. But in short, if you're studying 2-3 hours a day then you can probably meet your goals in 3 years. And I think with a study plan catered to your goals (if say you don't want to write academic essays but you'd like to spend more time understanding fiction well) your particular goals may take less years/days since you can dedicate more hours specifically to them.\n\nSelf study progress is doable. I've studied Japanese for 5 years (so long because I took 1 year totally off, and most years doing an average of 30 minutes to 1 hour a day with some weeks spending hours a day and some spending none). I'm somewhere in the middle of the recommended hours to learn Japanese, and I can read manga without a dictionary and get the main plot and a percentage of the details, read novels with a click dictionary (or prior context) and follow the main idea, watch shows with Japanese subs and follow the main idea, and am currently working on listening only comprehension like anime with no japanese sub, sand learning more hiragana words (since they're harder for me than Kanji words when reading). I can play my favorite games in Japanese like kingdom hearts, and just bought my first game im going to play with no prior context in Japanese (which will probably go fine since my reading skill is okay for main idea at least). I am doing some of your goal things. I'd do them better if I had studied more hours a day lol, not given up for a year, and had a better study plan the first couple years. With chinese, I started after 2 years of Japanese, and made a much better study plan catered to my goals. It took 6 months to get to watching shows without looking words up, 8 months to get into manhua reading, 10 months to read novels with a dictionary, and now 3 years in I can do both those activities and comprehend the main plot and almost all details without a dictionary or much effort, I can read novels without a dictionary, and depending on writing difficulty and my familiarity with the context/author, I can either follow all main plot and nearly all details and a portion of nuance, or down to just the main idea and many details if it's a very new genre/author for me where I know less words. I can look up words in unfamiliar genres to speed things up but it's no longer necessary. My main study now is just listening comprehension so I can handle audiobooks more. Now I do study plans that helped those goals and apply them to Japanese and its made my progress much quicker I think even though I'm not putting more hours in than before.", "created_utc": "1655126046.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic77ttd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_v9x2lq", "parent_id": "t3_v9x2lq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This is only based on the languages I've studied. English has a lot of content online. When I got into studying Chinese, it also has a ton of content online - free dramas, animated shows, audiobooks, webnovels, audiodramas, music online, a huge amount of subtitled content (subs in chinese are on most chinese videos and then often platforms add English subtitles). There's official show apps similar to Netflix with chinese stuff like iqiyi, youku, viki (and Netflix has stuff too, youtube has an endless amount of chinese shows). Viki has a learn mode with dual subtitles in English chinese and definitions and audio replay. And even if you're \"digging\" for a very specific thing in chinese, if you search \"media-name online free\" in chinese you nearly always find it. So I can find books I want to read in any language (like by Japanese authors) in chinese translation free online (whereas in Japanese I can only find them in print copies if at all), if I want to watch a Japanese stage play I can find it on bilibili entirely with chinese subs. Fans often make audiodramas to novels they like too, so even if there's no official audiobook for something you like (though there's usually an official one), there's also usually several finished fan made ones for free. There's manhua free if you search, and bilibili comics app lets people read manhua in English and chinese on one account easily. It's so easy to find pretty much any content you want in chinese for free online, and that's includes both so much chinese media you can find whatever you enjoy along with media in say English or Japanese or some other language I am trying to find (if I'm okay with searching for it in chinese or having chinese subs). Sort of like how in English I can search for a chinese show in English, I can do the same in reverse. There's also weibo which feels as big as Twitter for endless social media content (I can find reaction video makers for Thai shows and etc shows on weibo the same way I would on youtube, hobby videos, artists making comics, bloggers on subjects, etc). And then just regular Twitter and Instagram you can find plenty of chinese. I can find pretty much anything I can think of in chinese. The only caveats are small things like... it's hard for me to find chinese stageplays posted online (but it's also sort of hard to find English stageplays posted online). It's a bit hard for me to find disney movies dubbed in chinese online (I'm guessing Disney monitors for posts of their content online strictly). \n\nI study Japanese too, and I'd heard it was easy to find Japanese media. While that is somewhat true - anime is on a lot of accessible streaming (though it's on yourube less than it used to be), if you did raw manga in Japanese can be found online, and Japanese dramas on sites fans make subtitles for, and if you set up an account you can purchase ebooks. But overall a lot more of the Japanese media I like is dramas, novels, and games, and those I normally have to buy if I want them in Japanese. With chinese, stuff was so accessible online for free so much it feels like navigating the internet in English to me (audiobooks in particular and novels are even easier to find online for free in chinese just cause in English we don't have a big fan made audiobook trend and usually novels are sold there's less webnovel trends so far). Japanese media I like tends to require money from me more often. Which is fine, but is an adjustment after getting used to pretty much endless access to free content of anything I can think to search in chinese. \n\nI imagine depending on the language, how much is accessible free (or on stuff easier to find for an English speaker) versus how much tends to require purchases varies.", "created_utc": "1655008578.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ic1yalc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_va0jn2", "parent_id": "t3_va0jn2", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for all rhis!

I'm really hoping in a way I do have endometriosis because then it can be removed and I might actually feel better for a while and be able to eat again without massive problems.

But if you looked up words a lot more often, maybe me doing so too would speed up how fast I improve my reading skills. I'm wondering if at some point you started picking up more words from context and using the dictionary less.\n\n2. Do you think this could be feasible to do for a person who knows around 2000 words? I am guessing yes? I have a mesh of japanese experience, studying on and off for 6 years. Grammar I generally grasp, but vocabulary wise I probably know about 2000 words. When I'm reading, kanji help me with guessing word meanings a lot since I have some similar cognates in chinese with hanzi to help with guessing sometimes. Hiragana words are very unknown to me though unless I already learned the word. So I find myself looking up kanji words for pronunciation, and hiragana words for meaning, when I read in japanese. I sort of threw myself in the deep end trying to read novels for young adults. I can get through a chapter in about 20 minutes so my reading speed could be even worse. But I am wondering if maybe starting with easier stuff like \u9752\u3044\u9ce5\u6587\u5eab  would be a better idea to build up my base of knowledge and base reading level. I think to a degree how much you read helps, and since I am reading harder stuff I'm getting few very little reading per day.  I love and prefer picking up new vocabulary from reading, so I prefer to try reading asap. With chinese, I started reading graded readers within a few months then webnovels in 8 months once I knew 2000 words, and just kept going from there to learn new words. I want to do the same with japanese as early as I can, but with hiragana words without kanji and more kanji with multiple meanings, I'm not sure if maybe I should just be grinding more vocabulary in flashcards before I put a lot of time into reading.

I absolutely love audio file type resources like this. I used Chinese Spoonfed Audio files for chinese and they helped my listening skills tremendously, and since they were based on the chinese spoonfed audio deck they started simple and increased in vocabulary and grammar, with some repetition of some words, which let me pick up a LOT from context. I find english/japanese then repeat both once helps me. Do you plan to merge all these audios into one longer file? For me that tends to be easier to repetitively listen to in order to practice more.\n\nIdeas for alternative options - Clozemaster has a Radio Mode, where you can set number of repetitions and how many in english/japanese with a pause and in what order. Its a paid feature. But something like that in audio file format (like 20 minute chunks) could be quite useful. Clozemaster is to a degree ordered like n+1 but I'd say the difficulty curve is steeper like n+2-7 depending on the sentence, it uses sentences from Tatoeba. Sentences made/used on Nukemarine's memrise courses would be good for graded difficulty (like n+1 with some repetition of grammar and words to reinforce picking them up over time along with also one new element in most sentences).\n\nI really recommend checking out how the Chinese Spoonfed Audio files are structured, I found them to be perfect graded listening material - they start very simple, then get gradually more complex, eventually teaching 7000 words. With enough repetition of words to pick them up without drilling a ton like flashcards, but each sentence is still new. \n\nI found the old Glossika Japanese files, hoping they'd be structured similar to the chinese spoonfed audio files above. In a way they are, but Glossika starts with significantly more complicated grammar and a lot more new words per sentence, so its not actually n+1 (but more difficult) until you've done a couple dozen days and picked up a lot of the common words. Whereas the Chinese Spoonfed Anki deck and audio files are genuinely mostly n+1 and easier to start from a complete beginner perspective. I'm an upper beginner in japanese, so I'm still finding the glossika audio files useful, but its definitely a weak spot of them. Also the glossika audio files only tend to teach 2000-3000 words.

And if you have ibs c, if you need to take miralax or dulcolax or tons of magnesium daily or very often, call your doctor asap, get a gi doctor if you can asap, get put on meds that work better for you if possible. I used to be on dulcolax daily or I wouldn't go for 2 weeks at a time, then one day it stopped working, miralax in huge doses stopped working, and I ended up unable to eat for months and in the hospital and my gi doctor rushing to try and find something to move stuff through me so I could eat again (which turned out to be multiple colon preps). After that I needed a prescription med for ibs c that would work more reliably, and I needed reglan for a while. If your ibs c is already barely managed with a bunch of lifestyle and over the counter medications/supplements then it's worth seeing if your doctor can offer other options. If you have ibs d then same thing - if you're using the bathroom more than 3 times a day, or it's happening uncontrollably way too often per week, see if your doctor has more options for you because the daily life stuff you can do is not helping enough and you shouldn't have to tolerate it. If you're in pain often also call your doctor, some meds can help.

So I usually just read through a grammar guide summary within the first 6 months of learning (it usually takes a month). I don't bother memorizing, just reading through so I have some idea of what I'm going to see later in the language. Then I usually balance between grinding common word lists/flashcards (like 2000 common words or words-in-sentences in memrise/anki/Clozemaster) with comprehensible input (graded readers, learner videos, comprehensible input youtubers, or simpler reading/video material). And once I notice I stop running into such a brutally intolerable amount of unknown words, I stop using the common word list/flashcards. Because studying those words just helps me move into more comprehensible input.\n\nThen I move into mainly just studying from comprehensible input. Watching, reading, listening, and looking up words when desired. I look up more words (especially when intensively reading a difficult novel) when I want to learn more words ASAP. After some intensive reading sessions, that usually boosts my vocabulary enough that more stuff becomes comprehensible input. As soon as possible, I try to get most of my comprehensible input to be stuff I can learn nearly entirely from context (no looking words up). But if I want to speed up my progress I might look up words more. And then, months or years after reading that initial grammar guide summary, I may look up a grammar point or two as desired if I want clarification. For me, I find that most grammar points I read initially don't make sense until I see them in comprehensible input for a while. Then I end up only needing clarification later once I'm trying to produce writing/speaking, to double check I'm understanding what's correct, in case I forgot why a given thing is conjugated/written a certain way etc. \n\nSo for me, I do find initial grammar study very valuable. But I also don't need to perfectly memorize grammar right away when I do study it.

Buy them or get pdfs. Work on them at your own faster pace, skipping sections you already know since you've studied Japanese before. Once you get through the amount of book you need to, you'll have studied the equivalent of the classes you want to test out of. So once you start the formal classes you can skip those beginner classes. I know it's basically just like doing the class alone, but getting the same books the classes use would mean you don't have some gap in knowledge of what the classes would expect you to know in order to test out of them. If you want to make sure you can test out and skip some classes without ending up not knowing some stuff the classes expect, this would be most likely to cover it. \n\nThe fun response (which may not perfectly prepare you to test out to the classes you want to, but will get you back into studying japanese seriously): think to yourself what your actual goals using the language are. Read a manga you like? Watch new anime or drama before the subs come out? Play your favorite video games in Japanese? Talk to Japanese people? Figure out what you'd like to do with the language! Make a study plan for THAT. It's not going to perfectly prepare you to test out of a course in school. But it will get you to using the language for what you Want to do asap, which will motivate you to keep studying japanese long term wirhout giving up. And it's fun! You know around 1000 words? Start reading manga you like in Japanese! If it's hard and you don't know enough words, use bilingualmanga site so you have click translations or use a dictionary app to look up stuff. If it's brutally hard even wirh word lookup? Grind a few hundred common vocabulary words in anki or memrise or clozemaster app in a few weeks, then try to read again. You likely are close to knowing enough words to immerse (since you're not a total beginner), you just maybe need to fill in some gaps. I say grind through cause a lot of common words would likely be review for you so just skip them or refresh your memory and move on with those. If you want to play video games, try a game you know. Or watch YouTubes that teach Japanese through video games like Game Gengo then try playing a video game a little while later. Want to have conversations? Get on Tandem app or something and start chatting! Or get on youtube, look up conversational Japanese or comprehensible input Japanese, practice with those a little, then go try to talk to people again. Since you know a bit, you'll be able to do a bit of things you want in Japanese now and soon. Once you start doing them and learn While doing them or while practicing how to do them, you'll get better.

The grammar etc may just be harder for you/take longer for japanese. I studied japanese for 2.5 years and barely managed to get to the point of reading super easy manga with a dictionary, then gave up. I took a break, studied Chinese for a while. Chinese clicked way easier for me, I don't know how much was me just having a better study plan for myself and how much was me finding hanzi and the grammar easier. But I was making decent progress and eventually got to reading webnovels with a dictionary and watching shows without one. Then I felt like going back to japanese study too. That second time? Japanese felt a lot less intimidating, especially with all the Kanji that now looked fairly familiar it was just pronunciations and specific word meanings I would need to learn. Kanji having multiple pronunciations and the grammar is still the hardest part for me for japanese, and it does take me more effort than Chinese. But it's sort of like if I'd gone through all of Heisigs Remember the Kanji now, in the sense that the Kanji meanings aren't total mysteries to me anymore on Top of everything else. I find studying japanese very doable now. And worth it to me, because of why I want to learn. \n\nBut I know how hard japanese was to me that first time around, and giving up at the time made sense for me. I wasn't ready to go back to studying japanese until I really felt I wanted to face the challenge again. \n\nAlso I dont know if it would help you, but for me now thar Kanji meanings arent the main hurdle but instead mainly pronunciation, I use a lot more listening study resources than I used to. Things like Clozemaster with a lot of time just practicing listening, show subtitles in japanese, let's plays and audiobooks with subs, video game cutscenes with subs, glossika japanese audio, japaneseaudiolessons.com, Wasabi Japanese website.

Before The Little Prince, I had read and finished some graded readers in chinese, and read some webnovel chapters with a click dictionary. The Little Prince was my first attempt extensively reading a physical book without looking anything up with a click dictionary, and without it being a graded reader made for a learner. I picked it because it was easier than a novel written originally in chinese (I was looking at \u6d3b\u7740 too at the time which seemed harder), and I had a multi language copy of the book in French/english/Chinese. Do if I did get really confused, I could read the English section to clarify something and check I'd understood the main idea in chinese first. It was convenient since it's so easy to get ahold of a copy of a parallel text for it. It's also very short at under 100 pages so even if I read Chinese very slow I managed to finish in a couple of weeks. I also picked it because it only has around 2000 unique words. I only knew HSK type words at the time and any novel I started was going to be a huge amount of new words, so the limit being 2000 unique words (hopefully at leat 50% that id know) made my life easier than some other options I was considering. I also had hoped it would be mostly hanzi I knew, which it was. There's also a lot of Chinese audiobooks for it. Overall it worked great as a first real novel in the language. All the complaints you said apply though: it had some very useless words for me in the shorter term, was quite an odd little story worded in a fantastical way. It wasn't great for taking examples from. But it did serve my purpose of being readable at like a HSK 4 or B1 level and readable without a dictionary aid so I could practice extensively reading to build the skill. And it being a convenient parallel text so I had word/context look up IF I needed it was a major factor in picking it. With French, whatever books I could find parallel texts for (like Carmilla) tended to be the novels I picked to read first for that reason. It's a compromise between being able to read in print, and still have lookup reference convenient if needed. I often pick Alice in Wonderland for new languages even though i don't care for the story much just because it's easy for me to find parallel texts and audiobooks for it, and it's not a super long read. \n\nI've seen people mention Harry Potter for chinese first novels too (just in a general use for your first novel in a language), and I don't think it's the worst suggestion. If someone's read HP in English, then they have context to help them follow along which helps. Any book a person's read before in a language they understand is going to be a bit more familiar. But HP had a lot more unknown words for me, and was a longer reading time commitment. And I just wanted badly at the time to read and Finish a book without dictionary help. All the chinese webnovels I'd been reading were 100 chapters and 30 hour time commitments for me and even the easier ones I found, I could not read faster until after The Little Prince and using it to improve my reading speed.\n\nIt's definitely not a perfect choice though. It worked for me, but if more books were looked into for unique word count, I imagine there's better options that suit beginner/intermediate learners. What really limited me was trying to find decent options with low unique word counts, and the people who'd suggested some novels to me had only picked a few novels and given unique word counts and The Little Prince just had the smallest.", "created_utc": "1649186534.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i3j1e5x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_twxe53", "parent_id": "t3_twxe53", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I just checked.

So things like work, hobbies, interests, family, general discussions on politics or locations.

A2 skills: Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce themselves and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where they live, people they know and things they have. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help. I think a person could probably also talk about a few more in depth topics, if they are good at questions like \"what does X word mean? could you explain X? could you say X again?\" and are good at summarizing things with common words.

I've always liked this list, I used it for french before I learned a lot more words later for reading, and it did help me (along with grammar) to start having conversations a lot sooner than I think I would have otherwise. Not in depth conversations, but small talk and sharing general information about life (so A2 type stuff). That list also helped me get into the mindset of saying things with the words I know when I need to explain, when I don't know the word I'm trying to say.

But one of my goal webnovels have 96% comprehension (of just a random page I checked, so likely lower on some sections). And I can read it extensively now, but it's a slog. So 1k pages definitely wasn't nearly enough to read comfortably or average speed yet of webnovels (which I'm guessing are a bit easier than some novels). But also, with French rather than Chinese, amount read didn't seem to matter so much. It's been much more noticeable with chinese that large amounts of reading are needed to improve the skill.

This might just be a week or two of work. Then go study as normal, listening to new stuff you learn when possible (if your dictionary app has audio play it, your textbook has dialogue audio play it etc). Try shadowing every once in a while - where you try to speak like the audio, recording yourself if possible to compare with the example audio and try to fix ur mistakes.

I studied about 2000 words mixed from Nukemarines memrise LLJ courses (which i absolutely love) and Genki. I tried to read manga or play video games or watch shows and realized a Lot of basic words and phrases still seemed unknown. So I went into clozemaster and picked the 100 most common course (which has around 600 sentences). I went through the sentences in a month, listening then listening reading then listening only to really try to recognize words through both ways before moving on to the next sentence. I picked up so much grammar which I did not expect to, and as I'd hoped I picked up a ton of common words that just hadn't been covered in Genki or Nukemarines llj courses yet for me. Afterward I went back to manga and it was doable without a dictionary to read for enjoyment. And my favorite video game in English was then possible to play in Japanese. It turned out I needed that gap filled. I liked that Clozemaster doesnt only have learner designed sentences, but also messier ones and casual ones and long compound ones that I didn't get experience with from learner materials like Genki or memrise/anki decks which pulled from learner materials. It prepared me much better for the grammar I was running into in actual Japanese materials. It's harder for total beginners because of that, but because I was an upper beginner it just helped me. I used clozemaster the same way for French years ago to bridge the gap between learner made graded reading material and being able to read actual novels, and find Clozemaster works great for that A2 to B1 kind of transition comprehension wise. For japanese, doing so much listening with it also helped my listening comprehension a bit, enough to make me realize I wanted to use more audio flashcards.\n\nI ended up buying paid Clozemaster to try out their Radio Mode which is where it reads sentences aloud in target language, then English, then target language 2 more times (that's how I set mine). I really like the feature for either reading along to the sentences to hear Kanji pronunciations or to just listen and reinforce what I know how to read with listening skills. Also because it's ideal for picking up new words when listening with context (like Glossika but much cheaper). Clozemaster has always helped me improve when I've stuck with it and progressed a bit.

This can be more confusing at a lower level but still beneficial, and help fill in lack of understanding gaps once you're above absolute beginner.

If it includes no audio then know you need to go find a listening study resource. So some textbooks may need another textbook or website course etc to supplement them. Most often used textbooks tend to cover most things though. It's just I remember I got a Chinese textbook that only covered 200 words once and it was pitiful, and a French book which had only phrases and no grammar instruction whatsoever.", "created_utc": "1648129057.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1xg5zb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tlw22j", "parent_id": "t3_tlw22j", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "It works better as A2 or up, but you could just play a game.

I had to either add hours, or do it where one language I mainly maintain at current level with engaging with it a little per day while the other language I focus on improving faster with like 75% of my study time. It got easier as I got into intermediate because now to maintain and do enough to actually improve an intermediate language I can just read or listen or watch it for hours in place of what I'd do in English, so I have more hours in a day I can spend on languages. As a beginner I had to do a lot of 4 hour cram days lol to quickly get at least one language to a level I could replace an English hobby with that language (like reading or shows), that way I could stop needing set aside study time for both languages constantly to see improvement I was happy with. But if you study less hours per day you still eventually reach your goals. It just takes longer than if you can spend more hours per day. So dividing time between multiple languages is the hardest.

If you want to speak to a friend who speaks x, you can start trying to write things you'd want to say ans looking up translations and learning the words you'll need for those topics, the grammar tenses for those topics etc. If you want to watch a show you can look up \"how to understand a show in a foreign language\" and see specific ideas to get better at it ans start doing them. You can start with shows you've seen before and looking up words, or look up common words and learn them then immerse etc. Can set short term goals like I'll watch 10 minutes of a scene and look up words until I can follow that scene. Or with reading I'll learn the words in the graded reader vocabulary then read the graded reader this month, then next month read the next highest level reader, etc to work your way up to novels. And each smaller goal you do will prove you are learning and progressing and can eventually do what you plan to do. I find small and larger specific goals keep me feeling like I'm making progress and keep me motivated.\n\n3 you can give up for a while. You can change your study plan into something you like more. If you're feeling unmotivated you can change things up. In the end whatever makes you happy is good. Maybe language learning isn't what you want to do right now. If it is, then you'll eventually get the urge to learn and get back into it in a way that you want to.", "created_utc": "1647917073.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1m5mz5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tjr7qd", "parent_id": "t3_tjr7qd", "score": "15", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I focus on the 2000 most common words in anki, memrise, or clozemaster when I'm trying to push into reading. Another thing people often do either immediately or once they've covered common words, is pick up words for anki from what they're personally engaging with. Because those words will be helpful for you to learn personally. Like I am reading a novel with machines in it, it's important for me to learn machine and android and lifeform, words which may be a bigger priority for me to learn sooner than perhaps someone else. If you're a beginner, a lot of words you'll find important will end up being common words, so whether you use a pre-made deck or make one, a lot of the first several hundred/few thousand will be common. I used pre-made decks just to cover words that would help lower unknown words in general reading material asap, so I could move onto following main idea in shows and novels with some key word look ups. And those key words became the words I was choosing myself after the pre-made deck, to continue studying. Then I just kept finding new materials with new words and picking new words from them. Edit: learning vocabulary in sentences when using things like anki, clozemaster, memrise, I find helps.

I'm not sure what the method is formally called, but basically you have learning material where you hear NL then TL sentences. Or TL then NL then TL etc. Basically some audio files where you hear a lot of sentences in the target language, and their translations so that you can comprehend the sentence meanings. Ideally with some repetition of the target language sentence so you can get practice comprehending it again after hearing the translation, and shadow it if you'd like. So for me the best structure is hear the target language (to practice attempting to comprehend it), then hear the translation (for any words/grammar you didn't understand), then hear the target language sentence again to fully understand it this time (and shadow if you want). For some languages, there are really good audio files to do this with. Chinese - Chinese Spoonfed audio files, Japanese - japaneseaudiolessons.com audio lessons, Clozemaster app has Radio Mode which is also basically this method. Glossika (at least the old audio files version) is this method. Ideally, the sentences go from most common words to less common, so you generally comprehend almost everything except 1-2 new words or grammar points each sentence, and so that understanding builds up and words you learn earlier lead to sentences with 1 unknown you hear later. Audio flashcard files work SO well for me I was shocked. I just play them when I'm working but can still focus enough to listen, driving, walking, or grinding during video games and can focus enough to listen. I just listen through the files. If the files are well structured (like Chinese Spoonfed audio files) I pick up tons of new words and my listening comprehension improves a ton. I also get benefits from re-listening to audio files, but I personally prefer to just keep trying to expose myself to new material so I prioritize just trying to listen to more new files. \n\nWhen I used this method for chinese, it helped make my listening comprehension much more instantaneous, which made audiobooks WAY easier afterwards. To the point I no longer struggled to hear and immediately comprehend known words, and could start focusing on hearing phrases and comprehending them instantly, then hearing unknown words and figuring them out from context. It helped to the point I can now listen to shows without chinese subs or audio dramas and follow easier. This method quickly helped me bring my listening skills closer to my reading skills, and I also picked up a lot of new vocabulary without much effort. I did about 20 hours of it, and saw a lot of improvement. I am trying to make enough time to do it More because it helped so much last time I focused on it. I'm currently using old Japanese Glossika audio to do this method for japanese, and already its improved my listening comprehension somewhat with words I was familiar with, and I've picked up several new words. It is such an easy method, if you've got some time to listen and try to follow along. \n\nThat said, I don't know if it would be as easy to learn using this method if you didn't at least know some basic grammar and some very common words. I imagine the initial difficulty curve would be steeper if you didn't. Each time I've used this method I was around A2-B1 and just trying to improve my listening, and already at a point where I could learn some vocabulary from context in immersion and was just aiming to supplement that. \n\nReading and looking up unknown words, then eventually only looking up key words (or figuring out words from context) once I could follow enough to grasp the main idea. I think this is a fairly common learning method. But I tried this after cram studying about 2000 chinese words in memrise. I think some people wait to learn more words before trying this. But I read an article a guy wrote, where he said he learned 2000 common chinese words in memrise, then got on Pleco app where he could click words for definitions, and just brute force kept trying to read. And over time he learned enough to read without clicking for definitions. I had found the article when looking up how to learn to read in chinese, since I wanted to read a lot of webnovels. So I copied what he did, also reading a grammar guide summary to help prepare myself. It worked. It took about 6 months to go through the memrise deck and 1.5 years of reading like he said he did, but I eventually got to the point I could read my target novels without a click-dictionary if I wanted to and follow the story and most details (and with a click-dictionary if I want to learn more words). \n\nWhile I'm not perfect yet obviously, I thought this amount of reading comprehension was going to take me 4 years at minimum to read novels with a dictionary and then more years to read without. Back when I first studied japanese, it took 2.5 years to just barely read simple manga with a dictionary and follow the main idea only. With chinese, following this guys plan, it took me 6 months to read manhua with a dictionary, 1 year without, 8 months to start reading webnovels with a dictionary, 2 years without. 2 years is way less time than I expected it to take. I think I've read Readibu's app creator basically learned to read chinese similarly - brute force reading with a click dictionary until they could read more and more without a dictionary. So the method works, if you really want to learn to read and you want to start trying quickly. \n\nListening Reading Method. The site the method is from is long: http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm . There's a lot of shorter explanations out there. Its basically Step 1 (optional): read a novel in a language you understand (for context). Step 2 (optional): Play audiobook in your target language and read along to target language text (attempting to comprehend as much as you can, and match audio with the text so you learn how words sound/rhythm). Step 3: Play audiobook in your target language, follow along with language you understand text. Attempt to use the text just to help you look up the meaning of unknown words as you listen. During step 3 attempt to comprehend as much of the audio as you can, using the text as a translation when needed. (Step 3 is not reading the text and ignoring the audio you hear, you need to pay attention to the audio). Continue to do step 3 until you comprehend as much as you can. Step 2 and 3 can be repeated as desired. Step 2 and 3 can be switched in order if desired. You may just do Step 2 if you comprehend enough to understand most of the audio and don't need a translation reference like in step 3. Afterwards, optional steps include listening to just the audiobook, shadowing the audio, and attempting to translate the audio yourself.\n\nThe method attempts to give you the language with a translation so it can be mostly comprehensible input, then uses novel length texts so you get a lot of word repetition to help learn words/phrases. I usually just do steps 2 and 3, and then listening to the audiobook on its own repeatedly. I've done step 2 and 3 in both orders. I did this for 5 hours to test if it would work for me (but the method creator suggests doing it for a LOT longer). I would listen to the audiobook while looking at chinese text in Pleco and having it show the english translation for each word (so each translation would be next to the chinese like a parallel text). Then I would listen to the audiobook while following the chinese text without translations. Then I'd play audiobook chapters I'd already gone through in the background through the day. \n\nBy the time I'd gotten through 10 chapters, I'd learned enough words to be able to read the novel and follow the plot and most details without a dictionary. I acquired a lot of vocabulary doing this, it improved my listening comprehension somewhat, and it improved my reading speed (because I had to get used to reading at least as fast as the audio). I did not do this method as intensely as it was made for - it was made to do 8-10 hours a day for an intensive few weeks. I did about 1 hour every few days. I still saw decent results, so I plan to do this again next time I have time. It was also a great way to learn author or genre specific words quickly without grinding through flashcards. It feels intensive to do though, because you have to concentrate fully the whole time you Listen Read.   \n\nI tested out this method because I'd read of someone who tried this with The Little Prince in chinese as a total beginner. The audiobook is only 2 hours, so it only took a day for them to do. They saw some improvements in chinese after that experiment. The method states its better to use a longer novel though, so you get more word repetition, and a novel with more vocabulary variety so there's more words you can learn from it. If someone wanted to try, bilinguis.com and Duoreader app have some novels in parallel text english/other languages with accompanying audiobooks. A parallel text translation is the easiest way to do this, but if you just have a translation, an original, and audio, then you can do it.", "created_utc": "1647537459.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i11j0h8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tfw4xg", "parent_id": "t3_tfw4xg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "As far as comprehending what they say at a certain speed, that may just be a matter of more practice. I don't think I adjusted to faster speech until I just started picking immersion materials at the speed I wanted to comprehend. Then after listening long enough, I adjusted and got used to it. It sounds like maybe what you'd like to work on is comprehending speed? I personally would work on that by using slightly more challenging material. That said, if you don't feel ready to move on from the material you're using, you can keep using it. Since you already understand it fairly well, the more you listen the more you'll get used to comprehending it faster (without having to take time to translate in your head as much/struggle with faster sections).\n\nIf you want to challenge yourself by increasing speed, but keeping comprehension of content fairly easy, maybe start also immersing in cartoons for older kids. Those cartoons will speak at a more normal speaking speed (instead of slower) so you can get used to it, should still use fairly everyday language (especially if you pick a slice of life cartoon), and should still have a lot of context clues visually to help you figure out unknown words. Also, you could watch a cartoon you've already seen in english, again so you have more context to understand the sentences you hear when watching in your target languages. Cartoons like Avatar the Last Airbender, Spongebob, etc anything for older kids you can find in your target language. Especially if you've already seen it and have prior knowledge, if you're worried about difficulty. I do think any cartoon though, even new, should be comprehensible enough once you practice getting used to the speed. Especially if you already know 1000-2000 words. Even if you know less words, a lot of words you should be able to pick up from context (or from looking them up while watching).\n\nYou don't have to do this, but I think you could probably also handle adult dramas/shows now. Especially if you know 1000-2000 words or more. But again, even if you know less than that, if you're willing to look up a keyword here and there you'll fairly quickly learn enough words to comprehend the main idea. Once you can comprehend the main idea, you can pick up a lot more from context alone. If you know a lot of daily life words already like from Peppa Pig (household, work, friends, family, hobbies), then a lot of adult slice of life shows should be Very Watchable. A lot of romance shows should also be fairly watchable, since they also tend to stick to daily-life type words. Dramas for adults will get you used to normal speaking speed too, may have conversations more applicable to things you want to pick up (or eventually understand), and if the plot is daily life then the visuals should make it fairly clear what the main plot is so that you can immerse and gradually learn more until you're also understanding most details. It will probably be a process of: watching and hearing isolated keywords you know already and guessing main idea from visual context, then hearing a lot MORE words and phrases you know as you get used to speaking speed, then as you follow the main idea of dialogues fairly well the visual context of scenes will help you learn some of the still unknown words/phrases. It may feel 'draining' at first if its particular challenging. \n\nFor me, the first several times I tried to watch shows for adults I could only get through 10-20 minutes before giving up. After a couple of months of that, I found some 'easier' romance drama and just sat and tried to only pause ~5 times to look up what I thought were key words. After the first couple episodes I stopped needing to look up words (just rewinding or pausing occasionally like ~1-5 times to read the target language subs), and then I was able to get into a groove and binge 15 episodes. After that? Suddenly ALL dramas for adults was significantly easier, and looking up words became unnecessary, and I kept pausing less and less. Now that I'm working on listening comprehension I work with audiobooks more, but if I wanted to make drama watching a challenge I'd turn off target language subs (since now I can follow fairly fine with TL subs without pausing). It genuinely got easier just by making myself try to do it more - I think I had to adjust to the speed of speech, and really get in practice hearing words I 'kind of' knew over and over until I could comprehend them instantly. So if you know a decent amount of words, even if listening seems hard, I think its worth it trying to immerse in content for adults anyway and see if it gets 'easier' after several tries. (My experience with audiobooks went the same - they seemed impossible to follow without a transcript at first, but after several attempts I got a lot better at understanding parts of it).\n\nIf you go for shows for adults, certain things will make it easier: picking anything daily life/romance oriented will have more vocabulary people tend to learn earlier on, watching something you've seen in your native language before also makes watching easier (in japanese I know only maybe 2000 words but if I know a show from in english it is much easier for me to follow and pick up new words from context in japanese), watching something you already know the story of (so you already read the related book or read a plot synopsis etc). Also its worth considering watching a genre-specific show if you want to eventually pick up the words of that genre. After the romance drama I got through, I went right for mystery case dramas, wuxia dramas, and horror dramas. Because I knew I'd want to eventually understand those genres. Every time I started a new genre, my comprehension was initially lower, but it forced me to pick up the new 'common words' in that genre after several episodes. So later, when I engage with future things in that genre it's easier. If you go with cartoons for older kids, picking a more niche genre you want to pick up words in is also an option. You being able to understand Peppa Pig is impressive, I could follow the plot of daily life shows for adults before I could handle Peppa Pig lol.\n\nI think always having something a bit challenging as some immersion material, helps move up my 'base' of what I can comprehend easier. So if I can comprehend Peppa Pig, and I practice with shows for adults for a while and its difficult, then when I slighlty down to cartoons for older kids I'll find that those cartoons are now as easy for me as Peppa Pig was. So my well comprehended material is now higher than it used to be. So its worth trying some more challenging material every so often, especially when you feel you aren't progressing. \n\nSummary: Immerse in what you like and what helps your goals. If I were you, I'd probably pick some more challenging things. I think cartoons for older kids, and daily life/romance shows for adults will both be fairly doable for you. Both of those will have easier vocabulary and the main challenge will be getting used to faster speech and comprehending sentences with less pauses. If you want a bit more of a challenge, with a bit more new vocabulary, pick a genre specific cartoon or show you want to learn genre words from. If you watch without TL subs, the difficulty curve may be a bit steeper until you adjust to the speaking speed, but you'll eventually get past it. If you can't at least follow the main plot/idea of an episode (even with occasional word lookup if you plan to use word lookup), the material may be too difficult. For me, I noticed what I thought would be 'too hard' for me, was actually not after a few episodes. It's just the adjustment period felt hard. Remember however hard it felt when you started Peppa Pig, to how you feel now. So if you start a new material and it feels that hard, its fine, because you'll likely improve for a while just like you did with Peppa Pig.", "created_utc": "1647531240.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i112t0k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tfefwu", "parent_id": "t1_i0xvea5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Up to the person.

In those cases, easier stuff I can understand most of can still be useful. Especially for things like improving my reading speed or instant listening comprehension. When I want to significantly boost my reading level, I usually pick something difficult for me and look up words with a dictionary more often, just so I'll pick up a lot more new words quicker. Or if I want to be more comfortable in a new genre, I'll pick a show that's challenging to me so that I'm forced to hear the new genre words often and learn them. So I immerse somewhat with things that are at my comprehension level and then some things that are a bit more difficult.\n\nWhen I'm picking material I plan to learn new things primarily from context alone, at minimum I have to be able to follow the main idea of the material without a dictionary.

If I can't even follow that basic gist of the plot, then I am going to need a dictionary reference when immersing. When picking more difficult immersion material, I just need to be able to comprehend the main idea of the plot if I utilize supports like a dictionary app. If I can follow the main overall idea with aid, then I can learn from it.

I think the prokinetic supplement MotilPro also has 50 mg 5htp. I wonder if a slow release would give you less side effects like heart rate effects if it's not hitting you all at once. I have heard iffy things about taking anything affecting setotonin long term in case it effects your body naturally producing it, I understand what you mean about going I root cause. I've also heard tryptonan may be an alternative to 5htp but how your body breaks down tryptonan - into serotonin or not - can depend on your stress levels and exercise levels, so stress etc may effect it. \n\nIf serotonin seems to help you, it may be possible some antidepressant types may also help your motility - I would guess ssri like sertraline but I am not sure which work best for increased serotonin. I just know some tricyclic antidepressants slow motility versus some ssri speed motility, although it can vary for the person. For me my doctor has tried ssri and they also constipate me rather than helping though in theory they could help, tricyclic ones expectedly constipate me but in very low doses help with my pain and nausea. \n\nI have been doing neurofeedback for complex ptsd since September which has helped my vagus nerve function a lot (depression and anxiety went down to 0-2 even this Fall as I've been in the ER 12 times, my abdominal pain went from a 10/10 to a 0-5/10, at which point amitriptyline my gi doctor prescribes can alleviate the remaining pain). We did 13 sessions hoping my motility would improve eventually if it was due to stress or vagus nerve issues. However it did not. We switched to a gi protocol which increases serotonin in the gut and that improved my constipation on the day of treatment so we may try that again. And based on that I would imagine maybe serotonin aids like 5-htp may help. We are now trying a different vagus nerve protocol that works a bit differently, to see if that increases motility. I've done cbt and Mindfulness therapy in past years and my stress level was already quite low, but I've been trying neurofeedback this fall in case it could help to any degree - which it did. I've been much more stressed several years ago when some issues came up, which is when I did a lot of work on life changing and processing my past and making healthier choices and learning coping skills etc. Then I got gallbladder issues for 2 years, had gallbladder removed, gi system worked great. Two years have passed since then, and this Fall my body just started getting severely constipated to the point of being unable to hold down food for over a month, intense severe abdominal pain, intense nausea,, a lot of colon preps from my gi doctor to try to make room to eat, a lot of tests, a lot of ER visits from dangerously low electrolytes due to inability to eat. \n\nIn October it got slightly better as now I am on meds which keep me using the bathroom a little, and some medicine to lower the nausea and pain to a degree. They tested me for SIBO which I don't have, did a gastric emptying study and I was very low edge of normal so they didnt rule it as gastroparesis. I was on medicine reglan for gastroparesis for a while which helped a lot with being able to eat solids, it improved motility in small intestine, but its a medicine I could only be on temporarily because long term side effects are a big risk, so I've been off it since November and gotten some backsliding since then. I don't know what is causing the nausea, lack of appetite. Or why I am now severely constipated unless I take amitiza daily when for years I was functioning fine. My doctor thinks I just got very very backed up and my body is still recovering from being unable to eat solids for a month. I suspect either a motility issue in which case a prokinetic may help (I'd need a supplement and prescription reglan as a prokinetic isnt an option anymore), or if it's serotonin lack motility then perhaps gi neurofeedback protocol or 5-htp may help, or it's still vagus nerve affected in which case I'm hoping the vagus nerve neurofeedback protocol may help. \n\nNeurofeedback noticeably helped my vagus nerve function as far as making my anxiety drop really low to a very manageable level where I no longer worry or get anxious over things that used to trigger me a lot like people yelling at me, ER, doctors calls. And can now easily advocate for myself, stay calm, not dwell on worries. It decreased stress level as far as tension held in body and pain level noticeably. I'm not sure if neurofeedback is an option for you, I initially found it when looking into what may help panic attacks that happen occassionally even when you do cbt coping strategies and avoid triggers, my panic attacks would happen about once a month but by August they went away once I got sick. When I started neurofeedback they were already gone, but the pain dropping immediately gave me reason to see if it would help my gi symptoms. If your vagus nerve is affecting your symptoms I do think to a degree neurofeedback can help as I saw it affect some things quickly. I'm not sure if some physical issue is causing slow motility for me etc since vagus nerve work so far has done nothing to improve my nausea or lack of appetite or constipation so far and I've had 18 sessions now when if it's vagus nerve related the person I work with usually sees gi symptoms noticeably improve within 8-12 sessions. Hence why we tried a gi neurofeedback protocol which has helped people with chrons she's treated. If neurofeedback is available near you that may be something worth looking into. \n\nI'm still trying to find the root cause of my gi symptoms as scopes, blood tests, CT scans, xrays, sibo test, gastric emptying study etc have found no cause yet. I hope it will improve over time like my gi doctor thinks if it is just recovery. \n\nRegarding sibo, triphala and ginger are both prokinetic supplements which don't affect serotonin and may help with motility while treating sibo. I am using ginger right now and I see no motility improvement (but I have very severe constipation only amitiza and medicines on top seem to move since I've gotten sick in august), I do think it helps with nausea and somewhat with digestion motility as far as being able to hold down more solid food. Triphala I saw in one study compared to reglan as around as effective, and while triphala doesn't help me at all yet (reglan noticeably gave me some motility and took away nausea very well for me) in the study it worked as effectively (and to be fair for some people reglan does nothing so triphala may work great for some people).", "created_utc": "1640499065.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpzzhis", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_rhxekh", "parent_id": "t1_hpwhmi1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ibs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3g1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you!", "created_utc": "1640289111.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hppy9bo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rn0yq3", "parent_id": "t1_hppwbm3", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NevilleGoddard", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5d7"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for this response!

You are saying that may resolve with a few SATS sessions, I'll keep trying with it. Normally when I do SATS or affirmations I find one that I truly believe is true and done, so I am not used to trying to use one that does not already resonate with me. Thats why I was not sure if there's maybe a scenario that would be easier to believe is in the end. I think part of my issue with manifesting health is that the affirmations I've done so far seem to be believable as \"recovering\" improvements, not \"fully healed.\" Like I am not envisioning things into the actual end, but into mid recovery. I am struggling to vividly picture any fully healthy state right now, just small moments like dancing or walking or putting on makeup. I have been trying to come up with a SATS scene because a small moment once healed may be easier for me to feel happy and energetic versus when I try to picture myself running around a store and feel my doubts come. I'm sorry I may not be explaining well. I seem to have a lot of emotional blockage when I try to feel healed. With affirmations I more often feel that healed fulfilled state, but I normally do affirmations like \"At the end of September I'm able to eat solid food with ease.\" Or \"I can stay up all day now.\" Or \"I can drive safely and easily.\" And I am struggling to think of something more encompassing. Lately I have been affirming \"I am healthy and energetic.\" I feel something like \"I remember when..\" may resonate more but I am unsure what sort of statement for health would look like. \"I remember when 'I recovered'\"? That still feels not like being in the healed state, \"I remember when I could start dancing daily again,\"? Also feels like being part of it, not fully healed. Usually I am specific and it is hard for me to think of a specific scenario that encompasses being fully healthy and energetic again.\n\nEdit: I am struggling with the \"a scene that would imply you already have your goal and it it in the past\" part 3 of the post you linked (thank you for linking it!).", "created_utc": "1640286252.0", "edited": "1640286811.0", "id": "hpprkds", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rn0yq3", "parent_id": "t1_hppj4yp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NevilleGoddard", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5d7"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I've watched half of the Devil Judge and need to finish!

And back when I saw Advance Bravely I loved Gong Jun and really wanted him in my dream role as Wen Kexing in a priest adaptation (Word of Honor) and somehow unbelievably that's exactly what happened! I also loved Ian Yu in Men with Sword, and Killer and Healer was a dream show for casting him in another bl, casting another bl actor from Men with Sword, and another actor who is also slated to be in Immortality whenever that comes out.

The Guest is a horror that had some bromance vibes but ultimately its a trio who sort of become found family and a horror, romance is not an explicit part of the story. I would love Lee Dong Wook in something with an intense plot thats also a bl, dream scenario lol. And on kdramas, Beyond Evil isn't bl but it had some heavy bromance at the center of it and I'd be over the moon to have Yeo Jin-goo in a bl drama.

With me, my doctors were able to speed things up when I kept calling the office about my issues and asking what to do to manage symptoms and needing help asap - my general doctor could give me some lactulose to help the constipation, obviously couldn't do anything more but could put in a referal faster, my gi doctors office was able to put me on reglan immediately and look for sooner availability for scopes. Your doctors may be able to give you some meds now to help you manage symptoms, and speed up how long its taking to see a specialist/get tests. So it's worth trying to call them.\n\nIf you're low on nutrition/feeling awful/feeling faint, pain, flushed, etc. You might want to go to the ER if you ever feel real bad. Or call your doctors office when you feel awful and ask them what to do to manage symptoms now - they may tell you to to to ER. I had to go to the ER several times due to dangerously low electrolytes because I kept throwing up and couldn't hold solids down. Also if you do end up needing to go to the ER, they can prescribe meds that help nausea and vomiting stop like Zofran, can prescribe reglan, can prescribe other meds which may help, can do some tests in hospital to check for possible causes like X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound, blood tests. If your symptoms are Severe like throwing up all day unable to keep food down, or even liquids down, or you're feeling intense pain or weakness, or faint, the ER can help you Now if your doctors have no idea how to alleviate these severe symptoms. \n\nI'm sure people are going to have better advice than me and there's info on this sub for diets for gastroparesis which may help. But if you are having difficulty eating or keeping from vomiting - I was getting some nutrition from protein/nutritional shakes, tomato soup, juices, Gatorade. The month I was doing worst and in the ER every week that's what I was consuming to try and keep my nutrition decent (my doctor needed me to Last 3 weeks until she could get me in for a scope, I didnt make it and had to be hospitalized 2 days before the scopes but hey I tried). Anyway yeah liquids with high calories were the most helpful when I couldn't stop the vomiting - and again the ER or a regular doctor can prescribe Zofran to help stop the vomiting and/or reglan or another prokinetic to help with motility. If you are finding your symptoms unmanageable which it sounds like it since its affecting your life, then the ER or your doctors should be able to give you meds to try and alleviate things a bit until you can have further testing done. Passing out is reason enough to go to the ER, the frequent nausea is reason to go or for your doctors to give you a med to help, intense pain is reason enough (I went to the ER for all of these things each time my electrolytes were dangerously low, and ER/doctors were able to give some meds to cope with symptoms so they were not happening again as frequently). \n\nMy gi doctor at one point acted like me starving and unable to keep even liquids down \"wasn't an issue til I was dying\" and told me if I felt it was too much to go to ER - and it turned out I was at risk of dying my sodium had been so low. So at least for me my doctors didn't act like I had extreme symptoms until I was calling and telling them, until the ER was giving me directions to see my doctors within a week over and over, until the ER was calling them to help co manage my case since I Kept ending up in there with dangerously low electrolytes and intense abdominal pain, which is what finally got them to prescribe reglan and pain medication etc. I hope your doctors are better than mine, I just think that if you are suffering and it's effecting your life then you know how badly it's hurting you, advocate for yourself to be treated because just because you aren't dying right now doesn't mean you should have to tolerate suffering this much with nothing being done.", "created_utc": "1640130105.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hphn0d6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rlp09a", "parent_id": "t3_rlp09a", "score": "6", "subreddit": "Gastroparesis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2usbg"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I cant go on birth control/hormone options anyway - I have very bad reactions to every bc doctors have tried on me, and my hormone levels were normal.

For example for me, I know stress in my life increases my stomach pain. I've seen proof of that when I was in college I had daily nonstop abdominal pain that lessened when I quit, increased when I worked 60 hour weeks until I quit, so clearly stress was affecting my gi system.\n\nI'm doing neurofeedback for various issues right now, and a protocol for vagus nerve reset immediately lowered my pain from 10/10 to 5/10 or less afterward so at least some of my pain was due to stress. That said, parts of my symptoms have definitely been physical and required physical solutions. 2-4 years ago I had nonstop flare ups of 2 week long constipation for years, intense stomach pain whenever eating anything, I kept assuming it was \"mainly stress\" as did my doctors since I was working 60 hours a week. Doctors had me try fiber in case it was ibs, made it worse, had me try linzsess and I just puked and had worse pain and no relief. But I went down to 30 hours, still had these issues for another year, asked my doctors to look into it more - turned out to be a gallbladder issue. Needed my gallbladder removed, afterward all stomach pain was gone and so was constipation, it's possible I never even had ibs c back then and it was all gallbladder issues.\n\nI'm still mid doing neurofeedback and the protocols for the parasympathetic nervous system and vagus nerve don't help me any further, so we are exploring gi protocol that increase serotonin in the gut and motility. I've been having extreme gi issues since August including not being able to hold down solid food for months, nausea, severe medication resistant constipation (I'm now on amitiza which sort of works and before I was put on it I was in the ER weekly this fall). And it's clear for me that right now what symptoms are hanging around are physically caused - I am suspecting some kind of motility issue. Because my stress level is very low, my stress management is excellent right now, and I've already been treated for the \"stress\" effect since September and it lowered pain but didn't affect the other symptoms. My doctors have also tried various antidepressants in case it was stress caused, but so far every single one (even ssri sertraline) has made constipation worse. Amitriptyline makes the nausea and pain slightly lower at 25 mg so its what I'm taking now, but that still leaves my remaining symptoms with antidepressants don't seem to resolve. I'm willing to try some more but some have given me additional side effects making my quality of life even worse so I wish my gi symptoms would lower and get more manageable first. Like I said, I suspect there's some motility issue at play too as when I do tips for people with slow motility I get some symptom improvement. So while stress may play a role in worsening symptoms, I don't think it's the only cause of everyone's ibs. I wish stress was my root cause of ibs c because then I'd be healed by now lol! But unfortunately last time it was gallbladder issues and I suffered 2 years in awful pain just because my doctors assumed it was \"just stress\" even after I lowered my stress. Now I know that while i can try to improve my stress levels, my symptoms generally are caused by something more.\n\nAll that said - for some people stress May Be the root cause. And if it isn't, the stress might still make it worse (for me anxiety abdomen pain has generally compounded on top of the actual physical situation caused pain, so improving my qnxiety/stress does lower pain a little even though it doesn't improve the other symptoms). So I think the best bet is to push doctors to keep investigating for possible physical causes (food allergies, gallbladder issues, blockages if like me you're throwing up and cant use the bathroom for weeks even with meds, scopes, CT scans, checks for parasites or infection, gastric emptying study, motility tests, etc) and trying medications that may help with physical issues (so stuff like osmotic laxatives like amitiza for ibs c to see if it helps motility, stuff like reglan if your doctor thinks it will help treatment, stuff like fiber supplement if it's a dietary issue). And then if it's affected by stress, working on lowering stress, trying therapy options, trying antidepressants (I Wish I had gotten lucky and it had been all stress fault, cause then maybe one antidepressant would fix all my symptoms, but unfortunately I was not lol). Also antidepressants may be worth looking into just cause some affect physical motility (speed up or slow down, which can help ibs sometimes). And lowering anxiety/stress in general can help lower pain symptoms if you tend to hold tension in your body (I do so that increases my abdomen pain lol) or if it tends to give you nausea (can lower nausea from nerves) or tends to make stuff run through you (if it's caused or worsened by stress). \n\nBasically like yeah I think stress can be a factor and for some people its the cause. But its also worth checking for other things because if stress isn't the root cause then treating it may help lower some symptoms but won't fix it, so I don't love it when doctors assume it's just stress when other treatable factors can be investigated. If stress Is a factof involved there's some nice options out there for lowering stress.", "created_utc": "1640113575.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hpgiwz2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rlbo95", "parent_id": "t3_rlbo95", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ibs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3g1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Good luck!

Just a lot of pain for years until they determined it was my gallbladder and took it out. Afterward I was a lot better for a while. Then this year, 2 years after the surgery, I started getting intense constipation again that stuff like miralax did nothing for, hurting whenever I ate some foods then eventually nearly all foods, and it got worse until July when I started throwing up when I tried to eat and intense pain from anything I kept down. Then August I couldn't hold any food down and my gi doctor had me do 8 caps of miralax 3 days in a row Then 2 colon preps, only nutrition shakes for weeks as I couldn't hold down solids, and then after the constipation moved a little she put me on 3 reglan a day and I was okay. I had been backed up my entire large intestine on the CT scan I got once I could hold down stuff that week and rhe ct contrast liquid.. Better than I'd been in my whole life digestion wise etc. Then after a week I was unable to hold solid food down again. Then all of September was liquids and throwing up if I tried solid food or just much liquid more than a little a day. October I got scopes that found no issues, a GES where I was on the bottom of normal (13% food left after 4 hours), so they took me off reglan cause of side effect worries, and put me on amitriptyline for pain and amitiza to keep my system moving. October I could eat solids, November solids were harder again and I had nonstop nausea, this December I've finally gotten rid of the nonstop nausea for like 4 days now and I really want to keep it away. I am still mostly eating liquids, tolerating a little solids. My doctor has no further plans except \"see if you get better over time and check in with you in a few months.\" My gi doctor doesn't think I gp since I met the borderline for normal gastric emptying, but a lot of things here help me like ideas on how to get calories and handle nausea. Maybe I got a false negative on the ges but my doctor probably won't check again unless I get worse. I'm looking into supplements that help motility since I can't take reglan anymore - ginger isnt helping but it isn't hurting, I wonder if iberogast or Motilpro or 5-htp might help.\n\n If this issue is from my gallbladder having issues and needing to be removed, that's the only cause I can think of.

So my gi doctor made me stop it and ER also suggested I stop. I am still taking amitiza for constipation (otherwise I have severe constipation and can't hold down any food at all), and taking amitriptyline which stops the abdominal pain (but it slows motility - my gi doctor thinks the amitiza speeds up motility enough to not be concerned). I am doing somewhat better - nausea is gone now most days, no vomiting since 2 weeks ago, still no appetite and I feel sick when I eat but at least I can eat a little bit of solid food now (in september I could only tolerate liquids and threw up if I tried to consume very much so I was getting only a few hundred calories a day, now I'm getting closer to a normal amount of calories - still working on it). If/when you get a gi doctor, there are other motility meds besides reglan that they can put you on for longer term. For me, my doctor is waiting to see if I get any more improvements over time on my current meds, she thinks the med Motegrity would be too strong for me right now.\n\nGet a referal to a gi doctor asap. A general doctor is not going to know enough to investigate all the possible things that can cause these gi symptoms. The ER and general doctor gave me omeraprezole and carafate thinking it was gastritis, which did not help much. My gi doctor could do an endoscopy to check for gastritis, to check for h pylori infection and other infections, ordered a CT scan to check for physical issues like a blockage or other situations. If a doctor diagnoses you and you feel it's a misdiagnosis push them to keep investigating and or see another doctor. 4 years ago when I had gallbladder issues my primary doctor just called it ibs until I got to where anything I ate hurt intensely, my gi doctor thought it was ibs and prescribed prescription laxatives that didn't help, so then I pushed her to keep investigating and we found out it was my gallbladder causing the pain and constipation back then. As of currently, the issues I've gone through these past months no doctor has misdiagnosed me... mostly because they cant figure out what's wrong. But at least now they're aware of my symptoms and treating them with medicine, which is better than before I was getting my gi doctor to look into these issues.\n\nSo what I'm trying to say is just that best case, if you tell your doctors they can help you feel better. If they dont seem to be helping enough, or you think they settled on a diagnosis or treatment that isn't helping? Then tell them it's not helping, and the issues you're still having, and push them to look into it more or find another doctor. Reaching out for help will eventually pay off. I wish I had reached out months before I got to the point I could no longer hold down food lol. \n\nGetting a gi doctor referal will help so a specialist can look into your symptoms more. If you do think you do or don't have something you can bring it up, if you're symptoms aren't being treated you deserve for them to keep looking into what's causing them and finding better ways to help you. If you suspect gastroparesis a gastric emptying study may help. If anyone thinks it's gastritis - if omeraprezole didn't help after a few weeks it may not be that, and a gi doctor can do an endoscopy to check for inflammation.

The day I went was the first weekend this November when my nausea suddenly got Much Worse Saturday when I woke up and I felt sick I couldn't eat, couldn't do anything cause I felt too awful (not even watch tv), and had already tried zofran and ginger ale at the suggestion of my doctor and waited 2 days for it to 'pass' but eventually Sunday night came and I'd puked all weekend and I knew I needed to fix it enough to function a little/hold down something. ER didn't end up helping though but at least they checked to make sure it wasn't caused by something serious - my doctor changed my meds that Monday and that's what ultimately cut the nausea down to a more 'tolerable' level. Since then I've had a low to moderate level of nausea that's just been nonstop. Back in September, I think my high levels of pain were causing the nausea, and it had gone away in October once I had been put on better meds. \n\nMy nausea really is just nonstop since November. I wake up, I feel sick and like the idea of food sounds awful, I try to eat and still feel nausea, I try ibgard and ginger capsules and still feel nausea, I try to work through the nausea and drink something with calories, then its evening and I try to watch a little tv or browse my phone and try to ignore the nausea. It feels like when you have the stomach flu and you're past the throwing up stage but you still feel like anything you eat might come right back up, and I also have no appetite ever. So I just feel sick all day, try to make myself get some calories, try to work through the nausea. A trigger food will make it worse (I ate fatty fast food for a blood test last week I had to get done during a flare up and after I ate the onion rings and burger my nausea got so bad I was almost projectile vomiting and kept running to the restroom). Generally I've only been eating safe foods for me, mostly almond flour crackers/soft bars, mushy vegetable/meat soup, and protein shakes. They don't make my nausea worse but it just stays the same. My amitiza makes me fairly regular so when I wake up I use the bathroom, so the nausea doesn't lessen or increase really. I do not know why I've got constant nausea but I hate it and really hope it goes away at least some of the time at Some point. I really hope sometime soon, I want a break lol.\n\nI just got turmeric capsules to take in case maybe THAT will help with the nonstop nausea at all. Today I took ibgard which didn't seem to help but didn't make it worse, ginger capsules, ginger ale, nothing really helped, and then at my parent's house they gave me 3 peppermint teas and turmeric capsules and mint candies and finally at their house the nausea lessened a Little more so eating dinner felt less awful. I'm hoping that means something I tried at my parents house might be a key to helping. I also want to try metamucil like you mentioned in case it might help.\n\nI wonder if your nausea might be partly caused by pain or inflammation? Do you have pain with your ibs? Do you take anything for it? I think a degree of my nausea is caused by pain/bloating, because when I'm more constipated its worse (but I'm not letting that happen again lol), and my 25 mg amitriptyline I think partly helps dull the nausea because it lowers my pain level considerably. Similarly, I notice ibgard lowers my pain before it does anything else, so if any nausea is caused by pain that may be why ibgard was helping your nausea? When I looked up turmeric today it was mentioned as anti inflammatory so likely its also lowering my pain, which might be helping the nausea. If your ibs makes you feel you're in pain, or uncomfortable/sensitive feeling, then maybe if your pain lowered the nausea would too? Just since you mention it around when you need to use the bathroom, and your system moving things along/cramping might be increasing your pain around then. So any foods that cause stomach discomfort or bloating might be making it worse, and then any pain around things moving through your system maybe.\n\nJust curious, has the metamucil increased your bloating at all? I know with some people, fiber supplements tend to lessen bloating, or make it worse, and it can depend on which fiber supplement/type they're using that works better for them. Like for me whenever I tried benefiber I bloated worse and got constipated. I've heard drinking more water helps but I drink a lot of water already.", "created_utc": "1639619558.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hoq48e0", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_rgcg9k", "parent_id": "t1_hopw3y1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ibs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3g1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If an acid blocker helps like omeraprezole that's at least something you can use to help treat.

One of the many times I was in the ER these past couple months they gave me omeraprezole and carafate for 2 weeks to help with chest pains they thought were from gi issues and it did seem to help get rid of it. \n\nYou don't have to if you want to avoid it, but if you are concerned you might have chrons or celiacs or a structural issue you may want to push for scopes sooner rather than later, or a CT scan that can find structural issues. 4 years ago when I first had 'ibs' issues it was probably 90% or more actually gallbladder issues - but my doctors just said to take more fiber, cut things out of diet, and eventually I was eating chicken rice and crackers and still in constant awful stomach pain and constipated for weeks at a time. Finally I pushed them to look for more, they did a HIDA scan and my gallbladder was working slow, finally got referred to a surgeon, once my gallbladder was out I was able to eat most things again without pain and was able to use the bathroom most days with no laxatives/remedies/fiber supplements. If I had pushed to have my gallbladder checked sooner then I wouldn't have suffered for so many years. Likewise, it could have been celiacs (it did not turn out to be) but until I pushed for my gi doctor to check for more, she did not check for that. If you aren't feeling your quality of life is Solidly good with the remedies you're doing, or you notice yourself getting worse, or even if you just think you're doing too much remedies just to manage to cope (that's how I was this summer and I wish I'd called my gi doctor back in January when I started just bloating more instead of waiting until August when I couldn't eat at all). Then you might want to push for more things looked into sooner rather than later. An endoscopy is easy, a colonoscopy is not really that bad if you've ever had a day you had to take laxatives to really get constipation moving the prep is just like that pretty much. \n\nIf you did want to test if gluten or dairy cause flares, those are pretty easy to test. Like avoid cheese/dairy for a week then eat a pizza or mac and cheese and see if you feel awful (I immediately bloat and get constipated ToT) or if you just feel better once you cut then you don't have to try to reintroduce. For gluten, just avoiding breads/noodles/crackers for a week (there's thankfully lots of gluten free options) then try having 1 serving one day, 2 servings the next, see if it causes a flare. Also wheat and oats may be worth considering cutting - for me some gluten free breads and wheats still cause me issues, and oats do sometimes. I try testing a little at a time though, because even though I have some sensitivity I can tend to handle a serving of gluten a day, I can't handle dairy but some dairy containing things I can handle like chocolates and small baked goods. It depends on how sensitive you are (or full on allergic). An allergy clinic that tests food sensitivity can tell you how sensitive you are to each thing though, which is nice. For me they said according to my reactions I could handle the foods I'm sensitive to a couple times a week, which is true when my constipation is managed.\n\nI don't know what triggered my nausea for sure. I don't think its bowel movements as I pretty much have nausea nonstop the entire day. In September, I think the medicine lactulose was triggering it or increasing it, because lactulose bloated me badly and distended me. The hospital gave me zofran for the nausea which sort of helped. I don't get diarrhea at all unless I'm taking extra laxatives on top of amitiza to fix severe constipation - and even then everythings still solid not liquid. In October the nausea started going away because of amitriptyline, I also took ibgard for a week or two to help the pain fully go away. Then in early November I was taking amitriptyline on and off since the pain was gone while on it and I wondered if the pain was gone when not taking it. Around that time I woke up one Saturday with intensely bad nausea nonstop, took zofran and it didn't help at all, ginger ale didn't help, called my doctor. She eventually said go to ER but they didn't find any cause for my intense nausea. The following monday she put me on mirtazapine which cut the nausea down at first and gave me a very tiny appetite a little (but made me sleep nonstop and too groggy when awake) and then on week 2 the nausea came back at a low level and appetite went away again. After week 3 I asked to be put back on amitryptline because I can somewhat function on it versus unconscious all the time. I've been on it again about a week now and its dulled the nausea but its still there at a level nonstop. It makes me not want to eat and makes me feel like I'm gonna be sick. I've been so sick this Fall I've been homebound except doctor's appointments, and I haven't varied my diet except to 'safe' solid foods along with the liquid ones I've been having, so I don't think its any foods. I had a break from the nausea for a short while in October but once it came back stronger in November I haven't not felt it to some degree. Mirtazapine cut down the nausea the most but I think a lot of that was it made me sleep so much/unable to get alert and awake that I just wasn't awake enough to feel my body.

My doctors gave the usual advice \"you're constipated eat more fiber.\" I tried prunes and it didn't help. I tried more fiber foods and eventually fiber supplements on top and they all made me much worse. At that point my doctor said \"too much fiber can make people constipated, you should cut down on fiber.\" After that I cut oatmeal and fiber supplements, so mainly fruits and veggies still eating, and that helped to a degree. Turns out fiber made me more constipated. \n\nHave you tried apples instead? For a long time the fiver in apples is what worked best for me. For me it mainly made me regular and kept things a bit softer so it wasn't so hard to use the bathroom. For a while just an apple each morning helped a ton.

So I wonder if a fiber supplement like Metamucil might work better with 8 hours of sleep to go through a person without food affecting things? When I tried fiber supplements before I always took them in the morning or middle of day then ate like normal so maybe that affected them constipating me so bad. I cant really drink much extra water - in September and October I kept going to the ER regularly and had dangerously low electrolytes and the hospital figured it was because I was drinking so much water (lactulose was giving me diarrhea and then I'd drink more water and gatorade to try and rehydrate but apparently I was still losing electrolytes too much constantly). So since October I've tried very hard to just drink 8 glasses of water or only a little more so only around the amount recommended for my weight, I dont want to drink too much again and end up losing electrolytes so much. Basically the ER told me I was overhydrating lol and since they told me to drink a bit less I haven't had to go in for low electrolytes again thankfully. \n\nMaybe if I keep taking ibgard once a day it will start cutting the nausea down. I was taking it in October and it did help fully eliminate the pain after a week of 3 times a day. \n\nNausea can definitely be worsened by the constipation.

It helped with the pain last time I took it in October.\n\nI can't eat dairy, it constipates and bloats me really bad. So I probably cant eat Activia yogurt. I looked it up and \"Activia yogurts contain Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis AND our probiotic culture, Bifidobacterium lactis DN 173 010/CNCM I-2494.\" I'll see if any of the coconut milk or almond milk yogurts I can have include any of those.

I have Metamucil at home but I'm hesitant to use fiber supplements as in the past they made my constipation much worse, and I tried Sunfiber this November and it immediately constipated me for 3 days even while taking amitiza daily.

At this point I'm kind of just throwing any supplement at me that might help the nausea and intense fatigue. I've been taking ginger capsules the past week which while I don't think they've improved motility, may be dulling the nausea a little bit as at least the nausea hasn't gotten worse. \n\nYeah amitriptyline does slow motility - my doctor switched me to mirtazapine for 3 weeks (I think it also slows motility) for its anti-nausea and increased appetite effects, but mirtazapine knocked me out for 12-18 hours a day and drowsy when awake to the point I couldn't work. So I asked to be put back on amitriptyline because at least I can wake up and be alert while on it. It's not helping the nausea entirely but it helps a little, which was also how mirtazapine was, so of the two amitriptyline is working better. Since I'm also on it for pain I can't go off it or I have too much pain and nausea to work. I am considering asking my doctors to try a few antidepressants for pain instead that have diarrhea as a side effect, but they tried sertraline before and it caused constipation and didn't improve my pain at all, and my doctors mainly only considering meds which have some anti nausea effect since I have constant nausea this past month. I might eventually ask about Lexapro at some point, or wellbutrin (but I think that may cause constipation plus most meds just have that effect on me). While amitriptyline slows motility, with amitiza I'm still going to the bathroom daily. I don't know how many other options I have for stomach pain and nausea management. My gi doctor thinks this is working fine for now and I dont want to be switched to mirtazapine instead again. I think the only other pain management med she wanted to try is another in the same family as amitriptyline so it'd also increase constipation, because that one might also be anti nausea. \n\nI might be experiencing early satiety, I am not sure. I have no appetite in general so I'm just forcing myself to eat a few times a day. I haven't had an appetite since before things got bad initially in August. My nausea is pretty steady throughout the day, I think the amitriptyline is dulling it so there's times I can ignore it enough to eat a bit. \n\nI had a gastric emptying study done in October and results were low end of normal so my doctor thinks I don't have gastroparesis. I also went from liquids in September back to solids to some degree and not throwing up much (versus September where I puked most days I tried to eat solids).  I was on reglan in August and September and it did help somewhat, but overall I was doing better symptoms wise in October when I was switched from lactulose (which caused increased pain, bloating and nausea) to amitiza (less bloat, better for regularity for me than lactulose was)  and amitriptyline for pain/nausea (in October it got rid of nausea until early November, got rid of pain fully and since I got back on it I've felt the pain decreasing again, it's currently dulling the nausea about as well as mirtazapine but I'm hoping after a week of use it will help the nausea a bit more).  I was taken off reglan because it had been a few months and my gi doctor didn't want me to take it long term. Also she thinks to some degree the reglan was speeding up my system too much and that may have contributed to the degree of nausea in September (along with the lactulose bloating possibly causing some nausea). \n\nBasically my gi doctor thinks I had a severe case of constipation in August where I couldn't eat, then tried to reset my system with reglan, then I got constipated again and couldn't eat and lactulose in  September was making symptoms of pain/bloating worse even though it was helping the constipation, got cleaned out again for scopes in October where nothing was found wrong, then put on amitiza and amitriptyline and I was starting to improve but symptoms got worse again early November. My gi doctor I am guessing at this point thinks it's ibs constipation and nausea and bloating related to that, so I've been left to just stick to these meds and see if things improve. Which is making me feel a bit hopeless to be honest, but they tested for things and looked and couldn't find anyrhing else wrong. This fall I had two CT scans, endoscopy, colonoscopy, my gallbladder is removed so its not that, liver enzymes checked. She said if it was a motility issue she'd continue treating me with amitiza unless I got worse constipation in which case then she'd switch to something stronger like motegrity or linzess, but since I'm going once a day she thinks amitiza is working well and the others may give me diarrhea and more stomach cramps. \n\nI want to be hopeful things will improve but I'm getting so frustrated that the plan is just do this same thing for weeks and hope the nausea eventually goes away. I'm seeing a consulting doctor soon in case maybe they have some supplement ideas on what could help or some blood test to check for new things, but I already was given butryate and l glutamine which had little effect. I may ask my primary doctor if there's any other antidepressants that may help but I already know amitriptyline eliminates pain and at least dulls nausea and I'm not sure I'm ready to feel those symptoms worsen again. I may also see if I can see another gi doctor for a second opinion like maybe checking for an umbilical hernia with a physical exam since I'm not sure how much my gi doctor checked for that, and another gi doctor might have more ideas maybe. If my gi doctor is right then these are just annoying symptoms I'm getting for some reason and I just want to figure out how to lower them more, I miss my quality of life before this fall, I miss not being constantly fatigued and having nausea. If it was just constipation I can manage that right now with meds, the nausea is the worst for me right now as it didn't used to be this constant and never happened before this fall.\n\nI thought maybe probiotics might help as I took antibiotics in early November from a primary care doctor who thought it may help my gi issues, so maybe I have lower amounts of good bacteria right now? At the time I don't think the antibiotics made me feel better or worse, but as I'm hardly eating these last few months I imagine my gut health isn't ideal. I was tested for SIBO in November by my gi doctor and that came back negative. \n\nBefore this August, at the beginning of this year and to 2 years ago right after my gallbladder surgery, I was generally okay. I used the bathroom daily with no medicine unless I ate a trigger food (something fatty/dairy) and then a dulcolax or eating an apple would fix that couple days of constipation or it would fix itself in a few days of safe food eating. I had no pain unless I ate a decent amount of trigger food and pain would go away with a day or more of safe foods again, bloating was the same, and I had no nausea. It got somewhat worse in summer in that pain/bloating lasted more days after a trigger food, and dulcolax stopped fixing constipation as easily (along with constipation getting more frequent to once a week instead of once a month), but it all was manageable when I wasn't eating trigger foods. Then in August that's when suddenly I couldn't hold solid food down, became constipated for weeks at a time with dulcolax/miralax/prune juice/apples no longer helping. After that my doctor had me cleaned out with 3 8capfuls of miralax and 2 colon preps, a week of going regular again with reglan, then throwing up again unable to hold down food. Then lactulose, reglan, and still being unable to hold down much food and little solid food all september (which I'm guessing may have been partially cause of lactulose making me worse). But before this August, I rarely had issues unless it was specifically a trigger food I knew irritated my gut and I didn't have any lack of appetite or nausea. I'm not sure why I've been so sick this Fall and at this point it seems like my gi doctor is just waiting for the symptoms to lessen/go away over time since she can't find a cause and my medicine is treating the constipation element.", "created_utc": "1639542222.0", "edited": "False", "id": "holsrh7", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_rgcg9k", "parent_id": "t1_holc6vg", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ibs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3g1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Guardian honestly.

As bad as I currently feel, I felt way worse in September on lactulose. My gi doctor thinks linzess would be too strong for me and cause painful cramps and diarrhea, and that motegrity likewise would be too strong. Miralax on its own (when I'm not already taking amitiza) does not help me use the bathroom unless I take 8+ capfuls (and then at times it just causes severe bloating/pain and not bowel movement), similarly milk of magnesia doesn't always help and magnesium supplements don't seem to help at the doses I've tried.

So what I feel is how others can feel! And finally I felt like I could start figuring out my sexuality - gender never mattered to me, so growing up I couldn't figure out crushes cause I had crushes on all kinds of people but my parents kept saying crushes on one gender \"weren't real\" and parents/peers would say all the awful things about bisexuality that are bullshit - that I had to be a slut horny for everything, that I was confused, that I was sex obsessed etc. I was young and thought even kisses were kinda gross, it was so scary having adults imply I wanted sex with \"anything that moved\" just because they wanted to shame me and get me to \"pick gay or straight.\" Meanwhile in school I'd be called bisexual as an insult, lesbian as an insult, dyke etc. So being a teen was a mess! Very few people around me knew bisexuality even existed and the people in authority regularly lied to me about what it meant and shamed me for liking all genders.\n\nThen when I was 17 I learned more about sexuality from information sites, from some other friends who were also finally learning more about that stuff. And lo and behold I hear the term bisexual used again just like I heard it from a friend years ago when it'd finally made crushes makes sense to me lol! Bisexuality! And I embraced it! I came out, I told people off who had shamed me for liking multiple genders and acted like only gay and straight existed. I spoke up when people wanted me to go back in the closet or dismissed bisexuality. Ultimately it felt wonderful to know I knew how I felt, that there was a label for it and community. Around that time I got into Tumblr and how silly as it is, it let me meet a ton of other bisexuals at the time which further helped me really realize and accept how I knew I felt was real and I was not going to let peers and authority figures in my life be dismissive of me and try to push me into the closet and try to tell me how I felt wasn't real. \n\nRealistically I could identify as bisexual or pansexual, to me those both mean attraction to all genders. But growing up bisexuality was the only word I ever heard that connected to how I felt, and even when I tried using it growing up people just called bisexuals cruel things to try to say hurtful things. So for me, bisexuality is the community I found and word that I always found that finally made me feel not alone and like how I felt was real, and it's a word I had to defend. I spent so long in life around people who dismissed bisexuality and acted like it wasn't real and insulted it, so to me it's important to remind people bisexuality is real and I'm bisexual and I'm glad lol. I spent over a decade being told \"bisexuality isn't real, how you feel isn't real\" so for me it's really important to remind people bisexuality very much IS real. It's important to me I'm able to be openly bisexual because growing up I'd met so few bisexual people and if I had, then I would've known all the biphobia coming at me was bullshit easier, loved myself easier, felt less alone, realized there's tons of people like me. While I could identify as pansexual, ive dealt with so much biphobia and bi erasure and later finding the bi community a safe place for me to accept myself, that I just identify with bisexuality as a label more and feel I want to use the label. I'm really glad now that there is more acknowledgement of bisexuality and pansexuality now, I hope now more people figuring out their attractions can feel less alone and know there's lots of people who can relate, and know that the cruel things people say to try and dismiss us or invalidate us are bullshit.

I don't know if lactulose helping me use bathroom or the starving 'helped' in the long term or not, but it was a miserable month. My allergist back in august had suspected candida overgrowth causing the intense constipation and intense food sensitivities so I was on nystatin 6 pills a day - I took it for 1 month and didn't notice any improvement but who knows. \n\nIn October after a colonoscopy my gi doctor switched me to amitiza 8 mg 2 times a day for constipation, that has helped a ton - lowered stomach pain, works without diarrhea or issues, I could eat again a little bit and switched to meat vegetable soups and protein shakes and some almond flour crackers/bars (I'm sensitive to breads and rice so that was my carbs). I still had nausea and eating issues, my gi doctor gave me amitryptline 25 mg which helped with nausea and pain. Gradually got better and could eat a bit more solid foods like fruit, cereal, cooked veggies and cooked meats outside soups. Nausea came back in November and I'm now prescribed mirtazapine because it stops nausea and increases hunger which will hopefully all help with eating - and it has, no vomiting since i started it and better appetite/food feels more settled when i eat. So amitiza to move stool and mirtazapine for nausea/appetite are helping a lot currently. (Amitryptline helped with nausea too and gave me less tiredness so that's an option, I'd still be on it if the nausea hadn't gotten worse recently.)\n\nMy allergist in October did a blood test for candida, I still had a HUGE amount so I'm now on flucanozale for 30 days for it. As soon as I started this past weekend I noticed an improvement in my constipation and food tolerances. As of this weekend I also started flagyl antibiotic, my general doctor prescribed it because I have so many symptoms and I begged for something for it so they gave it in case it may help. I have noticed no bad side effects, I started it alongside the flucanazole so I don't know which is helping or if it's both. I suspect flucanazole is helping as its an antifungal and candida is something I for sure have. If I do actually have sibo, then the flagyl is probably helping too. Like I said my gi doctor gets the sibo breath test results next week so then I'll know for sure and she can prescribe the actual sibo antibiotic treatment for my sibo type and I can start that.\n\nIf you have nausea as the thing making it hardest to eat, ask your doctor if there's anything that may help right now. Zofran is an option for nausea (I was on it in september and it helped a little), amitrytpline helped mine for a while perfectly, and mirtazapine is helping great for tolerating more solid foods and having no nausea or feeling like the food is hard to keep down like I was before. Theres some other nausea meds too like Zofran but a bit different. Then of course sibo or sifo wise, antibiotics, antifungals, or herbal treatments may help once treatment starts if the sibo/sifo is making nausea worse (I definitely think it's Causing my nausea). \n\nI'm healing very slow, I got really bad in August and couldn't eat september, could eat a little in October, can eat moderately right now with the help of meds, but it is gradually improving. The amitiza really helped a lot for me personally just because while constipated I could not hold down solid food at all, the amitiza is keeping my gi tract moving things through. My gastric emptying study result was slow but still within normal range. There's prokinetic medicines if motility is slow though - reglan helps movement through the small intestine and helps with nausea and I was on it in August and it did help me, motegrity/prucalopride helps move the large intestine (my gi doctor thinks that's stronger than amitiza so since my current med works she didn't consider that, but it could help if motility ends up being an issue for you), I think linzess also helps motility a little bit while also working strong against constipation. I've heard ginger supplements, or triphala, or magnesium can also help with motility and are supplements you can try - I tried ginger and magnesium and noticed no improvements but I think my gi tract just tends to be resistant to a lot personally (like 8 doses of miralax may not help my constipation at all).", "created_utc": "1637724400.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hluu0xr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_r02gy8", "parent_id": "t1_hluqbur", "score": "2", "subreddit": "SIBO", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yo8f"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "How does high dose of extra virgin olive oil help with sibo?

They did not help my ibs whatsoever. They were still great though for life coping skills and general well-being.\n\nThis year I started neurofeedback and I've done 13 sessions. Originally id planned to do it because I was getting about 1 panic attack a month right before my period no matter what this past year, and my normal coping skills I learned from cbt were not working like usual to stop them. Even though for years prior they've worked. Well my ibs had also been worse this past year and escalating into severely extreme. As of now I actually think the ibs pain being so constantly extreme nonstop this year was probably causing more stress than I realized and probably causing the panic attacks, maybe bloating period pain on top of constipation ibs pain kept triggering them. Well August my gi doctor gave me multiple colon preps to clean out my extreme constipation and I was on medicines nonstop after that for the constipation (so less pain there). I was still feeling a nonstop 10/10 abdominal pain.\n\nSo when I started neurofeedback I asked her to try and treat the stomach pain mainly lol. She did a brain map on me and turned out I had stress stored in the part of my brain that controls the vagus nerve and affects the gut, so my treatment was tailored for that. Within 1 session my abdominal pain went from 10 down to a 5 and stayed there, within 5 sessions it went down to a 0 and I could stop taking amitryptline to dull the pain (which my gi doctor had prescribed). Neurofeedback absolutely helped with the ibs pain immediately. And it dropped my anxiety down to a 0 and I've been handling severe anxiety triggers for me now very well without any anxiety attacks or anywhere near the old level of anxious I'd get. So it absolutely helped with stress, anxiety, and ibs pain. For me it very quickly and obviously improved those. So if you're looking for improvement in those areas I do think it works and I saw results in few enough sessions to decide it was worth my time to continue.\n\nIt did not improve my severe constipation at all. My neurofeedback person does think if the constipation were caused by stress or the vagus nerve having issues, then it would eventually improve soon since I'm close to enough treatments for it to start giving those results. Based on my recent severe stomach health issues though, she and I both think there's probably some physical component causing the constipation so neurofeedback can't fix that. I'm being tested for SIBO, currently treating a gi tract fungal infection (which I think is worsening the constipation since treatment seems to be helping), and I'm going to ask for motility testing in case it's a motility issue causing constipation.

Also, your doctor could try meds for you as alternatives to magnesium and colace - I'm on amitiza 8 mg for the moment and it's letting me go once a day with no bloating or straining or pain, when for the last year dulcolax miralax magnesium prunes prune juice all stopped helping with bowel movements at all. Eventually I was going once a week or once every 2 weeks a tiny bit if I was lucky, then throwing up because I couldn't hold down food, had to starve and do 3 days of miralax 8 capfuls like a colon prep, then when it did nothing had to take 2 prescribed colon preps from my doctor just to make enough room to eat again. Then I was given lactulose as a laxative (which did work for a month but not well for me - it still worked when no other thing did at that point so you might find it helpful). Then another colon prep for colonoscopy and I've been on amitiza since and it's working reliably and with no issues. There's also linzess and trulance and prucalopride as options that help some people. \n\nFor fodmap, there are some apps like FODMAP helper (just search fodmap) if you wanted to try. Low fodmap is restrictive and from what I can tell, the ultimate goal is just to Start low fodmap then Test out medium and high fodmap foods one at a time and keep eating any you can tolerate, to ultimately pinpoint your problem foods. So eventually the goal is to just find the key problem foods that trigger you to avoid them, with the idea starting low fodmap will have less/no problem foods and the high fodmaps will probably be the foods more likely to include ones that trigger your symptoms. For me, I knew before trying low fodmap what my big trigger foods were already because they Immediately bloated me and caused pain - potatoes, grains. An alternative to trying low fodmap could be just trying to eat foods you know tend to not hurt you (say you know cheerios with almond milk,, and chicken with rice don't hurt) then add a new food and see if it triggers symptoms. Trying out new stuff gradually so you can catch the foods that hurt (like with me garlic apparently was triggering some pain but I didn't catch it until I paid attention to the stuff added in with my chicken lol etc). \n\nMy doctor basically ordered me to try low fodmap so I just downloaded an app, was already sticking to my \"safe\" foods I'm used to, and now I'm introducing new things (any low fodmap foods I wasn't sure if they hurt or not im trying first since they're more likely to also be safe foods, or any high fodmap foods I'm betting I can tolerate based on past experience so I'll make sure they don't cause symptoms now). If you get pain or ibs symptoms from food, you probably already have a usual diet you feel is \"safer\" so checking those foods in a fodmap app you might notice a high fodmap you still eat constantly that might be the one thing still worsening your symptoms (for example I constantly ate apples which are high fodmap and so I just tried replacing them with oranges to see if I feel better). Tldr: low fodmap is restrictive and yeah you dont need to be on it long term and it is hard. If you Think food is a major trigger for your symptoms, just broadly keeping in mind what foods tend to be safer for you then introducing/testing less safe foods one at a time may help you pinpoint some foods that particularly worsen your symptoms. That might be easier than strict fodmap, I mainly just used fodmap to see in my regular diet if I was still eating something high fodmap and so maybe something still causing severe symptoms. For me low fodmap has never helped my symptoms in any significant way, just avoiding the big foods I already noticed caused me pain and constipation helps.\n\nTo add: for some people an ssri or other med may help with the pain and sometimes constipation or diarrhea.

I am going to see a dietician at the end of November who's putting me on FODMAP, I'm already trying to eat low fodmap. I only have been tracking the scale for the last year because like clockwork, if I bloated over 5 lbs I would be in immense pain nonstop, and I would bloat if I ate any food that hurt me. And if I bloated over 10 lbs my food would no longer stay down, which was horrifying. Now I am watching it to make sure I'm not losing weight anymore as September was horrifying losing weight, and to make sure if I bloat and my medicines aren't working or I've eaten something that hurt me I notice before I'm unable to hold down food again. I can't wait for the day my stomach is stable again. When I mention throwing up it was because my body was just doing it any time I tried to hold down food in the last few months, until 10/11, and it was awful.\n\nThe only reason I don't think its SIFO is because in August one of my doctors at an allergy clinic prescribed me nystatin for suspected Candida infection, and I went on the candida diet and followed all treatment directions, and remained on that treatment a month, but just continued to get worse. I am getting a blood result back soon from that office on if I have candida or h. pylori infection though so it was tested for and I'll know more soon thankfully. \n\nI agree POTS is a definite possibility and if it's relevant then hopefully my heart doctor will bring it up soon and have some treatment plans for the heart side of things.

Years ago I'd had constipation for 2 weeks at a time and it never affected my ability to hold down food, so these past 3 months have been extremely scary.

So I did things to prevent myself from feeling drained: I limited chinese to 10-20 minutes of immersion every few days at first or less (until maybe month 6). And kept most of my studying as reading books (on grammar, hanzi) and on flashcards (anki, memrise). Or on watching dual subtitle content so I could watch mostly in english and just look at a handful of words in chinese as I got curious. Since watching subbed content in english never made me feel drained. Since you're only 5 months into studying Italian, maybe an hour is just really mentally draining for you right now? \n\nIf it is caused by just feeling really mentally strained by trying to focus, then it will go away as you improve. By about 8 months I'd worked up to a level where I could watch simple shows in chinese for 40 minutes straight every day or two without feeling it took so much focus it left me drained (still much more focus than english though). Reading at first, months 10-14 was similar. At first I could only handle it in 10 minute chunks before I'd feel drained/tired. Then eventually up to 20 minute chunks, then eventually multiple 20 minute chunks per day  with breaks in between to read as much as I wanted that day. \n\nTaking breaks any time you feel drained helps - just like if you were working a ton in your native language and started feeling strained. And breaks to keep your energy up. Picking easier content for you or shorter time periods engaging with it, again so it strains you less. Preparing for harder material before engaging with it also can help - that's why I did so many anki flashcards in the early months, so I'd stop running into heaps of unknown words every minute I watched a show. Then in reading, so I'd stop running into so many new words even in graded readers. Also, just in general the more you practice immersing while letting yourself be allowed to not always focus hard (so letting what's confusing just pass you), the less draining immersion feels. That's how I built up from watching 10 minutes once a week to 40 minutes+ most days a week. It took months, but eventually I got used to letting what confused me too much just pass by.

I also use the app Idiom, and they have a search/url bar for finding content and I can backspace in it if I make errors so it works with less issues. Your apps video content tool is better in some ways than Idiom.\n\nAlso having a bookmark feature for Web Assistant (or External Content section) would be nice so I can find content I was in the middle of reading/watching during my last session. In the External Content section, I can go into the different areas, but when I search it seems like its only searching the level of folders its in - so if I'm looking for Yoyo Chinese Drama channel on youtube for example, I need to go all the way into the Television Program folder before I can search for it. I also noticed its missing a lot of chinese channels - I figured that is because the External Content section is probably already-found and saved channels, so I just went to the other chinese youtube channels I knew of with the Web Assistant area. In the External Content section, I run into the similar issue where if I type anything into the search bar, I cannot backspace and fix it if there's a typo or if I got zero results. This is a big issue because its easy to make a typo, and then I have to go to the previous folder and then re-enter the folder to attempt to search something again. \n\nI think the main issue is just backspace doesn't seem to work in any url/search area for me (Android version of app), the search options are quite limited (which might seem worse because of the difficulty of backing out when an error is put into the url area), and there's no way to bookmark videos/websites I've found and would like to continue watching/reading again later (if there is then I just haven't figured it out yet is all).", "created_utc": "1631719530.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcyku12", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_po87ca", "parent_id": "t3_po87ca", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I don't know if it would be efficient, since lessons and/or flashcard sets might cover words in more order of frequency and introduce grammar in more beginner to advanced order. You are doing duolingo with it, which is probably good for some of that too.\n\nYour plan will work though. That's basically how I learned french, except I also read a grammar guide summary on a free website in a couple weeks before I tried. I learned 300-500 common words from a list just by looking at the list regularly with its sentence examples, read the grammar guide, then tried to read. I started simple with news articles and wikipedia before pushing into books several months later. But yeah within several months I was also basically going through a French novel I'd found at a thriftstore and trying to read it this way. The whole time I studied this way, I looked up a handful of keywords per page (or news article) and tried to guess other words - I basically just looked up enough to follow the main overall idea. Then to pick up some details, once I could follow the main ideas without word lookup, etc. So if you plan to look up every unknown word and grammar, and memorize everything, you'll probably pick things up much faster than I did! And if you hate reading grammar guides, your plan is still going to teach you grammar if you like studying grammar by looking it up as you read it.\n\nSo again, don't know if it would be efficient compared to some methods. But it would work, you could learn to read a language this way. And if its fun to you, and you can motivate yourself to do it regularly, then what's the most efficient study plan is whatever one you will actually do and continue to do. \n\nYou'll still eventually need to do other things to improve listening skills, speaking/writing. Reading easier things at first with more common words or more prior context you have, may also help it to feel less difficult.

I did notice studying Esperanto for a while helped me learn languages in general better. But for me I think it was mainly because Esperanto's grammar and word endings was so regular and the patterns were just so obvious to notice. So it helped me learn how to break down grammar and patterns when looking at a new language. Then even if I saw some irregularities, I could recognize common patterns in a language I studied As patterns quicker. If you have already learned some other languages, then you probably already have a good ability at recognizing grammar and word stem/ending etc patterns. So Esperanto wouldn't really teach you that as a new skill. Aside from strengthening the skills of recognizing new grammar structures/pattern, I don't think it particularly helped as far as actual similarities to another language. My French knowledge makes Spanish and Italian easier, Esperanto doesn't. \n\nIts possible Esperanto has some German like grammar, that's very regular, and would help you recognize that 'new grammar' pattern easily when seen in a language that isn't Esperanto. I didn't study enough Esperanto to notice if that's true. I only studied the basics of it, once it helped me with recognizing patterns, I went back to focusing on French.\n\nSince you have previous experience with learning other languages, its probably more time efficient to just continue with German. That said, you can learn a lot of Esperanto in 1-2 months.

I found mystery novels (particularly with modern settings) to be one of the easiest genres to start reading first. Because they usually are broken up into smaller cases lasting a few chapters, and after a few cases most chapters continue to revisit the same settings and main characters. During each case, the same locations are revisited over and over, the same suspects and detectives and witnesses are brought up, the same objects relevant to that specific case. So I got a lot of repeated exposure to the same set of new words for several chapters so that by the end of a case I felt much more comfortable with that whole case's 'main topics.' Then in the next case, I also was more familiar with: homes, basic town locations, offices, investigative questions, identifying the key new words for the new case's 'main topics.' \n\nI read specific chinese novels by authors I like. But I've seen Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie suggested before. And I think those novels work decently well for this - because they stick to just a few topics repeatedly for each case. I personally like Alice in Wonderland and Sherlock as earlier novels (they're easy to find in parallel texts), or just a novel the person likes that's on the easier end for them to read if possible.\n\nAs an example my first mystery novel's first 10 chapters were about a man staying in a hostel, interacting with the only worker there, and working at a clothing store when he finds a clothing belt that is haunted by the ghost who sewed the belt. So the repeated words involved a job, a hostel/home, sewing, clothing, ghosts. Then the next case was about that hostel again, a filming set, a job working on that set, a new murder mystery (so half as many 'new topic words') etc. By the third case at least 70% of topics and locations were mentioned in the previous chapters and still being reinforced, and new topics were being repeated over and over so I could pick them up easily. \n\nAnother type of story I found easy to transition to: children's stories about solving problems. Sometimes these are mysteries, other times they are just the character's problem solving by practicing something. Like adult mysteries, each story arc would be about only a few topics and keep repeating it. The second book I read in chinese after The Little Prince, was a children's story about a cat that wants to learn to speak to help a man who sells newspapers in the park she lives in. So she visits a poodle, and the poodle's new friend the bird, and learns to speak from the bird - each chapter mentioning those settings and tasks over and over. Then in the next arc the cat hears of a mother in a coma of a human who visits her. And so the cat has a dream to go to the hospital, and sing to the mom when the child can't. The only new topic was the hospital setting, which was reinforced for several chapters. Unlike a full on fairy tale, this kind of story was set in regular daily life for the most part, with the problem solving meaning a lot of repetition in topic. And like The Little Prince, the cat didn't understand how people talked or why people had jobs, why some animals are pets, related humans sick to the cat sick having been to a pet hospital, the cat learning to 'grow up' by having a wish and what a goal is, so some concepts got explained in the story to the cat. Christmas and New Years got mentioned in this story, through the cats interpreting the decorating and celebrating, along with how the seasons work. \n\nSo yeah, just stories about mystery cases, or about problem solving/working toward a specific goal. In a way, Harry Potter also isn't too difficult because it sticks to 'this happens in a school' so most topics are school and daily life related, there's some action, and then some niche magic and made up words. But its overall pretty limited in settings until later on in the series. Any novel where the setting does not change much, topics stay mostly surrounding one thing, seems easier to me for learning new vocabulary and it getting easier during the same novel. The reason I go for mystery novels so much, is because I do get a fun change of topic/scenery every so many chapters, but it changes infrequently enough that I can get used to one set of topics comfortably before I have to learn new ones.", "created_utc": "1631289035.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcbpo0q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pl4a21", "parent_id": "t3_pl4a21", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "For me, I'd consider that 'level 5 comfortable' to be where a native speaker generally is for most texts, which is around 98% or more for comfortable reading and new words comprehended from context. Sometimes even native speakers reading a new genre or technical text will need to look up words because there's more new words than the amount that can be easily comprehended from context. So I would say, if in your specific domains you usually read in you comprehend 98% then you are probably there. \n\nFor example: if you can read general non-fiction for your particular daily needs/usual interests/news (but say clothing mending with sewing technique articles are confusing because you never sew or read up on that hobby), and some fiction is 98% or more if its genres you generally engage with (so say modern mystery and daily life novels - but if you read a novel set 400 years ago with a decent amount historical terms you may have to look some additional words up). \n\nI would imagine for certain domains you'd hit 98% comprehension sooner - like for daily life conversations and general discussions on what your hobbies and daily habits are. So you can probably start writing on those topics sooner compared to being able to summarize an article you read on the state of the economy/the plot of a murder mystery you're reading. This would all be based on if you're waiting to write until you comprehend 98% in some domains.\n\nPersonally I start writing a little before I start speaking. I try each skill for a few months, then stop and learn more for several months, then try again. Each time I'm trying writing/speaking on topics I'm more familiar with (which expands each time I'm learning more in between writing periods). For me, the production practice every several months means I can get some immediate correction on if I'm using a word I've learned wrong, on if there's a more natural way to phrase some things I 'think I can produce fine', and catching any ingrained bad-grammar habits before they're super long term so I can correct them. So far its been going well. I don't think I'm going to focus on it closer to 50% of my time until I refresh my grammar and read through a grammar guide again. I want to read through a formal guide again, and do some writing drills/practice with those examples to base my structure off of, before I push into production more. I know each time I've tried my production has gradually gotten better (better vocab, better grammar). But it hasn't been in a reliable way. Whereas now (or very soon) I'll have enough vocab and grammar I easily passively understand, its just a matter of needing to learn to reliably produce it correctly myself. \n\nI have a friend who uses duolingo, and yes it only has beginner vocabulary, but my friend has much better automatic production of correct grammar simply because they have to drill it constantly when using the app. Whereas I have a much larger vocabulary to speak about most topics I want to on at least a basic level, and my grammar is 'understandable' but it is not in a 'drilled habit' of reliably correct structure. I can be understood, but because its not always actually correct grammar, I worry I am reinforcing some bad structures because its understandable so I don't get the pressure to fix it that I would if I was working with a paid tutor and grammar drills. \n\nSummary: Start writing as soon as you want. Writing is easier than speaking, is helpful for eventually building good speaking skills (improving your active vocabulary, reinforcing use of correct grammar structures, writing gives you time to recall vaguely active vocab and double check your grammar). And whenever you start production whether its early or years in the future, you'll still need to work on strengthening active vocabulary you can recall instantly and correcting any weak grammar usage you have in production. So whenever you start writing is whenever you start working on improving those areas. If you want passive vocabulary to somewhat help make learning active vocabulary a bit less work, then start with writing in domains you're more comfortable in (if you can comfortably read about X topic or X level texts then start with trying to write like those so you're using the same vocabulary/grammar you can comfortably passively understand).", "created_utc": "1631287828.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcbmob1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pll2pr", "parent_id": "t3_pll2pr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you have any way to turn on dual subtitles, that may help. Like looking up chrome extensions for dual subtitles (Learn Languages with Netflix extension did this). Then when you're watching, whenever you get curious about a word you can glance at the german subs and try to figure out the word's meaning with the help of your english subs too. Just seeing the german subs alongside english might help you start figuring out what some german words mean.\n\nOr just having some translator app on your phone like even Google translate. When watching, if a word or phrase particularly interests you, look it up. Even if you're only looking up 5 words/phrases an episode, that will add up. \n\nAlso just like RyanSmallwood said - if you hear a particular line or word and from context it probably means the english subs you see with it? Feel free to repeat the german line/word out loud. That's the first earliest thing I did with chinese, I was watching dramas from early on. And I had dual subs but couldn't read any chinese and was too lazy to look up chinese words. So when I heard a phrase and it was clear it meant the short english subs roughly, I'd repeat it to myself. I would also once I learned some more common words in my target language, rewatch scenes or episodes sometimes I'd watched before with english subs. But the rewatching felt a lot harder until I got to a certain level. Mostly what just helped at the beginning, was trying to get used to listening for the language, and trying to match it to some english words in subs when it was obvious enough to. \n\nNow that I'm 2 years into studying, shows with only-english subs I can do the same thing but now its more to make sure I'm still paying attention to the chinese words I'm hearing (since now I can hear and follow a lot of them). I still also pick up some new words this way - now that I'm intermediate, its pretty obvious if I hear one or two new words in a sentence. So I can try to pick it up or if I need to then pause or replay the line real quick to see what english word in the subs it roughly meant (or figure it out from context) and say it aloud to myself to remember the pronunciation.", "created_utc": "1631284380.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcbe975", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_plihzp", "parent_id": "t3_plihzp", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If I am considering something totally passive immersion? Then for me that means I'm not focusing on it at all on purpose. So for me, none of my immersion I consider totally passive. So when I mean 'passive immersion' in my own keeping track of how I study, for me it mainly just means 'I was not focusing on the immersion completely.'\n\nSo for me, what I consider my 'passive immersion' is when I put on an audiobook or some kind of audio in the background as I play around online/browse reddit etc, in the background as I clean or do not-too-focus-intensive work tasks, play to listen to as I go exercising (I don't bother looking up words or fully focusing since I'm enjoying the scenery and busy exercising), play as I drive, etc. I prefer audio flashcards (because it almost feels like active study like anki but I can multitask), or audio I have prior context for (either something I've listened to/read actively before or something I know the vague general setting of like a new chapter of a novel I've read previous chapters for, an audio drama for a show I've already watched in english or target language, etc). When I have some kind of prior context, I feel like there's a lot more immediately comprehensible things I hear even if I'm not paying attention much, so its easier for me to learn some new things/reinforce what I know even if I'm not focused on it much. \n\nThat said, if you do totally passive immersion - as in do not plan to pay any attention at all - there's still some chance of some minutes spent while its happening that you'll happen to focus on it anyway, so its still probably more immersion than doing nothing at all. \n\nNukemarine had the idea to play background audio throughout the day of both things you've actively studied before (so you'd get used to comprehending them immediately instead of after a delay of thinking like in flashcards) and shows you've seen (not all comprehensible but you had some prior context at some point). During some points in a day, if its constantly playing, you're bound to notice it and pay attention to some degree - like if a tv is playing in a waiting room and you happen to take a break from a phone/reading/talking to someone. I think Matt also had this idea of passive immersion in the background, as did many people doing Refold/mia. I've also seen outside of Refold, people mention the benefits of re-listening to things you've actively studied/actively immersed in already. Like having actively immersed with a podcast or actively read through a novel chapter, then listening to that podcast again in the background a lot or listening to that audiobook chapter a lot. Over time, things that took effort/some active word lookup or replay/re-reading to comprehend will get easier to just understand immediately. I've personally noticed this happening for me, and ever since I started listening to way more audiobook chapters and condensed audio in the background throughout my day. It has helped my speed for picking up new words/phrases, and improved my listening comprehension a ton. \n\nJust in general, http://www.thewordbrain.com/ mentions that about 1,500-2,000 listening hours is needed in a language to fully develop the ability to parse the sounds of the language. For that specific skill, passive listening counts even if you don't understand the words and are just listening to the sound (like listening to immersion audio the way you'd play the radio, a youtube video, an instrumental song etc, in the background when working). So in that way, passive immersion's useful even if you're really not actively studying any of it as far as actively trying to follow the plot/lyrics etc.", "created_utc": "1631282092.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hcb8yte", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pli9zq", "parent_id": "t3_pli9zq", "score": "7", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I sort of agree with [The Word Brain](http://www.amedeo.net/wb/TheWordBrain2015.pdf) (page 18). For me, my experiences lined up pretty well with the estimates it gives. \n\nFor a highly related language like French, definitely by around 5k words I noticed reading whatever I wanted without a dictionary became very doable, as long as I have 3 or more sentences for some context in case there's an unknown word. For a language with very few cognates with my native language like Chinese, I know over 5k words now and while I can read the 'overall main idea' usually, whether I grasp new words in context or need a dictionary for a decent portion of details totally depends on how close the material's reading level is to my own and to topics I'm already familiar with. So I think 15k words is much more realistically close to how many words I'll need to learn for reading to feel more like reading in my native language english for me feels. \n\nI've read in articles people have mentioned about reading, anywhere from 7-8k for comfortable wide reading skills where reading no longer feels harder or more limited than in one's native language, to 15-30k words for 'can read anything with 98% comprehension and very few unknown words.' These ranges also seem to make sense compared to my experiences - for me I would guess 7-8k for languages more similar to my native language, and 15k+ words for languages with less similarities.", "created_utc": "1631205615.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hc76s4g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pjxvx8", "parent_id": "t3_pjxvx8", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This is going to be a little bit in reverse but it may apply to you. I studied French mainly to learn to read, and eventually got to a point after 2 years where I could read whatever I wanted (provided I had 3 or more sentences of context) without a dictionary at a level I was happy with. After that I kept using French but not studying as intensely, except for pronunciation and production skills at various points. So my reading level in French is good enough for my personal needs that I no longer need to actively study it or use a dictionary for reading (at least not any more than I use one for my native language). I have had my Google account in French for years now, so I've also had google searches for definitions in French, sites that use your google language in French like wikipedia, in French for years. At this point when I see French online its like reading my native language. Non-fiction is very easy to read quickly. Fiction is a bit more dense of a read for me, particularly if its a new author's style - so reading speed of fiction may vary.\n\nFor Spanish, all I have done: I listened to several LanguageTransfer lessons, I read a few chapters of Spanish for Beginners by Charles Duff, I read maybe 100 pages of Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish. Combined study time is probably 0.5-1 hour a day for 3 months tops. So I do have some basic Spanish knowledge as far as some super common words, cognates, some basic grammar. Madrigal's book is very good for covering a lot of cognates and recognizable word changes to near-cognates.\n\nI had a Linguistics book in Spanish and needed to read it, I read about 50 pages in an hour and it was not particularly challenging, no dictionary required (though I'm sure that would've sped things up and given me more concrete definitions for some things). This was a non fiction book with a lot of technical terms, so I think it probably was much easier to read than a work of literature. So French reading skill absolutely gave me some Spanish technical reading improvements. If I had known none of the very-basic spanish words though, there may have been less reading-skill carry over. And I think in works with less cognates (like fiction) this benefit would not be as great if even there. Since your goal is academic papers, depending on the topic yes reading skills in one language will help to a degree. If/when you have some reading fluency in Spanish academic works, try out reading a French one. \n\nThere's also learning books specifically made for learning to read. There's quite a few \"French for Reading\" textbooks that are really well designed, catering specifically to developing reading skills fast, if your main goal is just to read better in French. I've seen the textbook French for Reading by Karl C. Sandberg , Eddison C. Tatham which I liked. And French for Beginners by Charles Duff that pushes into teaching reading skills/practice immediately. These kinds of books dive right into teaching for reading skills. I think it can be quite quick work to study French if its mainly just for reading purposes and passive comprehension. \n\nFor fun, here's how much cognates/somewhat similar grammar helped me with no prior knowledge. My French reading skills actually help my Italian reading skills a bit! I picked up Dante's Inferno the other day and was surprised how many words I could make decent guesses for based on similarity to french and spanish words I can read. Not enough to fully grasp Dante's Inferno, but enough to know I'd be looking up handfuls of words instead of every single word. So when starting the textbook L'italiano Secondo il Metodo Natura (which to be fair is already designed to be immediately comprehensible to a beginner), I am finding many words to be much easier to remember as 'quite close to things I learned in French.' \n\nHowever, take this with a grain of salt. For one, because there are false cognates which can really screw you up in other romance languages so what looks like a cognate does NOT always reliably mean something similar (however I think in academic non-fiction writing this is easier to spot if you have some familiarity with the topic you're reading on). And second, I have italian family members who spoke bits of it to me growing up, so I suspect a lot of aspects of the language are much more 'familiar' to me just on hearing or seeing again because I've definitely heard some of these things before. Whereas with Spanish, that 'familiar' feeling rarely happens and reading-ability boosts are mostly due to guessing from cognates and similarities.\n\nEdit: because someone mentioned pronunciation. I should add that in the little spanish and italian pre-study I've done, I've heard at least enough basic pronunciation differences from french that the three languages do Not sound the same in my head. Right when I first started spanish, before I'd studied the sounds, I struggled when seeing spanish because in my head it was read like french and that just confused me immensely/got me stuck a lot. So for me there was some value in going through some pronunciation/sound basics to make sure a language is distinctly different in your head.", "created_utc": "1631204938.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hc755wa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pkg3em", "parent_id": "t3_pkg3em", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Ohhhh <3 <3 <3 DEFINITELY final fantasy vibes.

In the long run, you'll get to your goals in each language eventually if you keep studying them.\n\nThings I personally noticed when I've studied multiple at once:\n\n- for me, it was easier to learn them in different stages. So starting japanese once my french was B1 and I could read in it with a dictionary and chat in it and was past learning the basics, so that I was not learning the same kinds of words and grammar at the same time. Likewise starting Russian once my japanese wasn't absolute beginner etc. Basically staggering when I started a new language worked better, I personally got confused if learning the same topics at the same time in multiple languages. I paused japanese after 2.5 years, studied only Chinese for 1.5 years, before resuming japanese - because I knew if I studied both at once I'd cover to many similar subjects still until my chinese got better than my japanese. Having chinese at intermediate before I resumed japanese from upper-beginner, worked better for me than doing both at beginner stage at once. It may be fine for others.\n\n- Personally, spacing out study of very similar languages. I tried to learn Spanish when my french was high-beginner, it was awful and I constantly confused the languages. My french is solid intermediate now, and now when starting Italian I have very few issues confusing the languages. I noticed I needed to develop an internal 'sound of the language' before starting another language that sounded somewhat similar for me, otherwise I got very confused very easily. This was even true to an extent with quite different languages like japanese/chinese and russian/french. The more I developed a sense of 'internal sound' for a language, the less I get it confused when studying another.\n\n- Limited study time. I imagine if you can increase your study time, no language 'days it will take to improve' will change. But if your hard limit is 'I can only study languages 3 hours a day' then adding more languages means each one will take 'more days' to improve. If I study Chinese for 2-3 hours a day I can make progress at a speed that motivates me. If I study Chinese and Japanese for a combined 3 hours a day (so only 1.5 hours each a day) then both languages will take more days to see improvement, and I may become demotivated it's taking me even more months/years to hit specific goals. If you can increase study time per language, this is not an issue - like say make 6 hours for study time, or 9 hours if you study 3 languages etc. (Or if you planned to study Spanish 1 hour, then adding another hour for the next language etc). While in the long run French may take say 1000 hours to learn, if I'm studying 3 languages at once and then french gets 1 hour of study time instead of 3? Then french would take me 3x as many days to hit my milestones. So keep this in mind as far as if you can stay motivated/divide your study time in a way you're happy with personally.\n\n- Changing my goals and which language I focused on periodically. This helped me with motivation. For example: I would have a short term goal to learn 1000 new words in japanese over a couple months, and for french my only goal would be 'maintain current level.' So I would spend 2/3 of my time in japanese doing heavier study, and 1/3 of my time just reading or chatting in french regularly. I might make small improvements in french but mostly I'd just have the goal to maintain it. Meanwhile I'd make faster-than-usual progress in japanese since most study time would be going to it, and the progress I'd make in 2 months would motivate me. Then I'd have learned enough words to practice using/reading them - and could switch to maintain that japanese level, while spending the next 2 months focusing most study time on French pronunciation improvement and listening skills. I would rotate my goals like that, so that in the short term I could see a bigger milestone improvement in a specific language and keep myself motivated. I personally needed to see some significant improvement every once in a while to keep getting myself to study.\n\nSummary: its not significantly harder. You may find, just like studying different subjects in school, a certain structuring of the study time/when you start studying specific topics in each language, works better for you. The hardest thing I think is making enough study time for Each language per day/week that creates enough daily progress to keep you motivated. If you have a Lot of free time? This isn't hard. If you only have a few hours to study per day, then multiple languages very quickly slows down 'daily progress.' But in the long run, a language will just take X hours to hit milestones, and that won't change if you study multiple. It just means days to reach X hours may change depending on how much study time you can do per day per language. Also - there's no reason you can't try studying multiple, find out if it works or not (and if it does how). If it doesn't work, you can always try again in the future. Or just resume study of a new one once the first language you're studying reaches your goals etc.", "created_utc": "1631034234.0", "edited": "1631034757.0", "id": "hbyabub", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pjnycu", "parent_id": "t3_pjnycu", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "It depends on the goal. For French my old goal used to be just 'read whatever I want to without a dictionary.' At about 2 years in I accomplished that. So I left my google account in French (since it had been in french, so I still get a little french reading each day), and just read as desired (every few months to every 6 months). Reading ability is passive so I retained it fairly well without needing to use it much - when I haven't read for a year it comes back within a page or two of reading again. \n\nRecently I have a new goal of improving active speaking skills/grammar when producing french. I have french friends but we don't chat in french much and they don't get annoyed if my grammar has errors sometimes. But I'm looking at some jobs with a french language requirement, so I'll eventually need to do actual grammar drills until I get in the habit of mostly correct sentences when speaking/writing. Also my active vocabulary is weak right now from non-use, so I need to re-learn it and improve it for speaking. Speaking requires more active use to retain for me, so once I've done some grammar exercise prep work, I'll probably try to get into speaking/writing weekly. Then if I get a job, obviously continue that as it will be necessary. If I don't get a job, then probably scaling back to writing/speaking once or twice a month. I probably need at least that much to retain my active vocab.\n\nChinese - my initial goal was to read what I want in chinese with or without a dictionary. I'm getting much closer to reading without a dictionary for the goal novels I wanted to read than I thought I'd be. So now I have added goals of: decent pronunciation and production of grammar, decent listening comprehension so I can listen to audiobooks when too lazy to read, and being able to translate with less strain. I did have a goal of watch shows without dictionary/english subs but I hit that already unless I want to do translation of subs for others. Translations a bit of an additional skill, so that needs development now. Listening goes well with my reading practice, so they're both progressing. Speaking/writing skill will be my last to work on if I get there, since there's no specific need to speak correctly soon. Right now I speak/type fine to chat with friends or online for what I chat about. I just want it more corrected in the long term. Once my reading/listening goals are hit I plan to do what I'm doing now, just less regularly - reading and listening to novels I like. Maybe doing more translation/transcription then, since I'd still be working on translation goals. \n\nFor speaking, if I ever get there... which who knows, I imagine that's 4-6 years away... then like french I just plan to speak/write more like 1-2 times a month to maintain my active vocabulary and grammar patterns. I already speak/write intensively about every 6 months of study. So it would just mean a bit more time chatting, compared to now when its spent on reading time. I imagine for both french and chinese, I can eventually scale down production skills to once every 3-4 months. I only speak french every 6 months to a year, and a level of base active vocab/grammar sticks or comes back within a few days. So I imagine with enough practice, much more will come back even after a break in using it. \n\nWith japanese, I studied for 2.5 years, then abandoned completely for 1.5 years. Then when I picked it up everything came back within 2 months and I was learning new things again. I stopped again for a few months, came back, and within a few days was able to pick back where I left off. So I think, to a degree what you've learned Well will come back relatively quickly even if you don't use it for long periods. But I think active skills are harder for me to maintain with long gaps between using them, whereas passive skills I maintain very well.", "created_utc": "1631029658.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbxz5nn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pjofut", "parent_id": "t3_pjofut", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Depends on language.

But its odd - any language I randomly wanted to study, later on I found reasons for it. The first language I learned to do anything considerable in, French, I literally only started trying to learn because I'd failed at learning several other languages and wanted to see if this time I could be more successful. Then while studying, I found old french books and really wanted to read them, and that personally motivated me, and I got really into french for reading! It's only now years later, that I happen to have french friends where reading/chatting in french is relevant on a regular basis, and happen to be seriously considering some jobs and education plans where french is a requirement. \n\nI wanted to study japanese because I simply wanted to experience some of my favorite stories in their original language before translation. That is still the main motivator, although I've found more goals now. Italian I just want to learn because I have family that still lives there and speak it, but I rarely get to speak with them. Somehow I've ended up with some italian friends now and even more reason to want to speak it, I've gotten into reading italian recently and now wanting to understand is a lot more immediately useful for me. When I was young I wanted to learn ancient egyptian, and while that was a mess of me not knowing what to do, it made me curious and started my love of studying languages.\n\nWhen I started chinese in high school, it was only because I was sick of german classes. My chinese teacher was from Beijing, was a supportive figure in my life school wise, and really made me feel positively about wanting to study the language and keep pursuing making art which I loved. So later as an adult simply watching a chinese show made me want to pick it back up, made me want to learn to read just to read the novel of the show (that hadn't been translating) then everything spiraled and here I am now lol. There's the practical reasons of wanting to read in it, translate it for friends who want to read the same novels, and watch shows when no translation exists or I'd have to wait. But there's also just that I have reasons now I use it regularly, chat with people, and friends also learning it so its something we are sharing the learning process of somewhat. \n\nI studied some spanish once on a whim, just beginner things - I had a 'Spanish through Reading' book and I was curious how well the learning method worked lol, and a few other 'learning resources' I wanted to test. I never got far, but studying the pronunciation made my french and italian better because I could notice all the differences easier. Years later it helped me with reading a spanish linguistics book I wanted to read, and now with Italian the spanish and french I know is helping a lot with figuring out cognates and those kinds of similar words.\n\nI think if you want to study a language, its worth it.

The first few months I had no particular personal motivation, but because I was learning french I ended up buying old 1930s French books from a thrift store that looked interesting. I love books. I love history. I very much wanted to read them. I got motivated, and that definitely initially drove my urge to really learn french to read and very much succeeded. Now, years later, that pays off because I have french friends that using french with is useful, I have places I'm seriously considering applying for that require french, and so I'm already in a much better place then if I'd just never given french a chance. \n\nI had no personal reason to learn it at first, but picked up reasons by starting to study it.

I looked up a common 2000 word list with sentence examples and read/reviewed parts of it for 5 months. I printed out parts of the list and read/reviewed every week to month a bit. I read through a grammar guide summary in the first 6 months and just read through, didn't do exercises or get stuck on things I didn't quite get. I did some basic pronunciation study. Then I immediately started trying to read - first just small news articles and wikipedia in months 3-6 and looking up a handful of words or less per article then figuring out the rest from context, then months 6-12 informational textbooks/articles/history books. Months 12+ graded readers from the 1930s, Le Francais Par Le Methode Nature which is a graded reader with over 2000 common words in context, grammar in context, and teaches french in french (ideal comprehensible input). \n\nAfter a year in I stopped needing to look up words and could guess meaning of a vast majority of words from context, it became 1-2 word lookups a page or chapter IF they seemed like key words for meaning or a detail I was curious about and I felt like looking it up. At 1.5 years I read through a grammar guide again with much better reading skills, the guide was entirely in french. \n\nThen I started listening to LanguageTransfer, Teach Yourself French audio, Coffee Break French audio for a refresher on pronunciation because my inner voice for french was incredibly weak. I made a major mistake of very little listening immersion until then. It took a few months to develop a decent speaking accent and more decent inner voice during reading for french by listening to that french and shadowing. I still work on listening skills sometimes, mainly only audiobooks or youtube videos to reinforce listening I never did. My accent somehow is still decent and liked by my french friends which I'm grateful for. My production skills are basic comfortable A2 but I can talk about more subjects if someone else says the words first - I have a big passive vocabulary from lots of reading and a very small common word active vocab. But after about 2 years studying french, I was able to read whatever I want in french with no dictionary and comfortably (without mental strain) and be basically conversational/read texts and emails friends send and respond. \n\nI still want to work more on listening skills, and perfecting output skills so there's no errors and larger active vocabulary from more usage. I cannot work in french, only translate from french, because I truly neglected output. But I accomplished my goals of reading with a very messy badly attempted plan that was similar in many ways to refold. I only studied .5-1.5 hours a day, so a person doing Refold and many hours a day will improve much faster. And a person who focuses more on listening input, and more on output once they can read than I did, would likely have a very good french ability after 2 years. So I got into refold after I learned french to that level, because a similar strategy worked so well for me before. Refolds encouragement of early immersion and often, being brave with it, has helped with chinese immensely. And srs in general has helped with chinese and japanese a lot, where with french and its many cognates srs benefits weren't as critical. I have outputted within 3 months for japanese, then taking a break and outputting after 2 years - it didn't hurt me. I outputted at 5 months a little, then every 5-6 months in practice bursts with chats and shadowing apps ever since, which has only personally helped (especially with tones and ensuring I'm comprehensible to native speakers and correcting obvious pronunciation errors they hear that I hadn't noticed). So early output did not destroy my learning, however I don't know if waiting may be more effective in the long run.", "created_utc": "1630783276.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbloop1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_phkl3d", "parent_id": "t1_hbloo9w", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Not the complete method. But I have seen different things that Refold suggests doing, suggested by other language learning methods and other full-learning-material courses.\n\nSpaced Repetition System - digital srs flashcard systems have been tested and shown to help learn and retain info in an efficient way by timing when you study based on when you'd need to see something to not forget. Memrise, Anki, and other programs use srs repetition, so that is good for memory. Doing flashcards in an srs study plan would be equally effective. And doing flashcards daily/at a random schedule would also be somewhat effective, its just you may need to review more times if you're reviewing things you already learned regularly/forgetting to review other things in a timely manner. So doing an srs review schedule generally saves some time. That said - studies have shown you just need to see a word several times (6-12) to remember it, so happening to come across words regularly in immersion through reading/watching/listening can also help ensure that even if you're reviewing at random times, you're exposed to the language frequently enough with immersion that for many (at least common) words you will see them enough to remember them. So in that way, immersion compliments/helps even a random review schedule as far as helping you to remember things. http://www.thewordbrain.com/ goes into how spaced repetition study can save you some review time, as do a plethora of articles online for more than just language learning.\n\nImmersion - somewhat beneficial no matter what. Because you must practice comprehension to get better at comprehending what you DO know. You must read more, to improve instant comprehension on sight and improve reading speed of things you've already studied and know. You must listen to improve ability to recognize and hear instantly words you have studied. And once your comprehension hits a certain point, in our native language we can learn many new words/concepts given the surrounding context. So we eventually will get the same benefit from immersion during some periods of immersion when we comprehend enough. And similar to review benefits - if we look up words when immersing, we are starting learning/review process with either new words or words we've previously studied or forgot. And that will add up to learning those new words once we've read their meaning at least once (in flashcard study/textbook/immersion/course etc study) and then seen the word enough times/re-looked up the word as needed enough times. Usually 6-12 times over a decent enough time period (like a couple months) for it to get remembered. This research article mentions general SRS effectiveness and attempts to build an even more efficient spacing for review: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/10/3988 . The book [Principles of Learning and Memory](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Principles_of_Learning_and_Memory.html?id=zWuLBQAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) goes into how spaced review is more effective for remembering things than cramming. Again, a plethora of articles exist on why spaced repetition studying is efficient (although any schedule of spaced review is likely to eventually lead to you remembering, just spaced repetition based on when you may be likely to forget if you don't review may be more efficient time-wise).\n\nListening to the language (like during immersion) also helps with learning. The Word Brain page 24 (linked above), mentions needing 1,500-2,000 hours of listening to a language to achieve semi-perfect sequencing abilities. So every time you listen to an audiobook, radio, compressed show audio, watch a show, listen while reading, podcasts, passive or active, you are at least somewhat adding to the amount of time you are listening to the language. That adds up. And listening skills will improve as that time adds up. So simply listening more to a target language has been shown to help listening and parsing ability to the specific sounds of that language. On a quick search, I'm only seeing anecdotal comments of people saying it took them a couple hundred to a couple thousand hours of listening to parse sounds. This book [Teaching and Learning Second Language Listening: Metacognition in Action](https://books.google.com/books?id=58AyEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT56&lpg=PT56&dq=how+many+hours+of+listening+to+a+language+to+parse+sounds&source=bl&ots=FGvC8IYkNp&sig=ACfU3U2fh8fLZZbW375YYPw2x_ws4WghkA&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj94_Of-OXyAhVZV80KHWCCAVMQ6AF6BAgvEAM#v=onepage&q=how%20many%20hours%20of%20listening%20to%20a%20language%20to%20parse%20sounds&f=false) (ctrl+F 'parsing' and 'perception' and read those sections) mentions that the perception and parsing listening skills improve over time (so immersing to listening material regularly or chatting regularly etc would contribute to practicing) and initial skill we start at depends on our native language. It mentions that if our native language has a lot of similar sounds, we may not have to learn to percieve and parse as many new sounds. So, based on anecdotal stories and some research, at least some hundreds of hours or more of listening is needed to improve perception and parsing listening abilities. Which immersion helps with.\n\nGrammar study - Refold mentions looking up grammar as curious, and glancing at a grammar guide and reading through it as a beginner/intermediate if desired. I have seen several polyglots and other language learning method blogs suggest doing similar things as a beginner. I have seen some encourage doing a quick breakdown of sentence structure basic grammar before diving into a language, some suggest doing a basic course first as a beginner like Assimil or Teach Yourself (which usually covers basic grammar structure at least), some literally look up grammar summaries and read through them while gently reading through then moving forward after they don't understand some points and just planning to re-read those sections later as they run into the grammar points in immersion and get curious (https://sakubi.neocities.org/ grammar guide suggests this, many japanese learners use Tae Kim's guide similarly even if not doing Refold method specifically, I started doing this years ago before I found refold as it matches my learning style and it's worked great for me, Nukemarine's memrise courses are structured this way, etc). Basically, if you go searching for grammar-study suggestions from a variety of language learning blogs, many non-Refold study method learners do something very similar with grammar study approaches. \n\nSo there are several pieces of Refold method that are utilized and suggested in a plethora of different 'language learning methods' people use in general, and courses in general have suggested. \n\nAbout when to output language specifically: Refold suggests waiting, and when I've read various other language learning methods suggestions vary wildly. Generally most courses overall suggest doing some basic pronunciation study when you start to learn basic new sounds of the language and basic sound recognition (including Refold). So even classrooms (at least good classroom courses) will do at minimum this portion of study before having anyone speak in general (except perhaps survival/basic phrases like hello/goodbye/please/thank you/1-10/my name is, which may partially be just to keep students engaged especially younger kids, partly to get started on prep for anyone who's just learning the language to be a tourist asap and needs basic phrases to get by). The 'basic tourist prep' is also likely why stuff like Pimsleur, phrasebooks, and many beginner courses, go over 'buying things' 'travelling' 'ordering food' 'getting travel plans' asap - tourists may not care to learn correct pronunciation because they just plan to learn these quick things to speak for a couple weeks or less then either learn more Fully or drop the language. Overall though, most language learning individuals online, methods, and several textbook self-study courses (like http://gigafrench.com/) suggest some silent period to really delve into listening skills and pronunciation study before speaking (the shortest I see still being a few to several months). So most study methods do have Some length of a silent period. Refold has a particularly long one of a year to multiple years, and that may make it geared toward learners who'd prefer to output later and improve input comprehension skills first. Despite this, there are several individuals Refold has done 'MIA interviews' for on the youtube channel who Did output super early because its what kept them studying/motivated or speaking with others was a major goal they wanted to do asap. It did not seem to harm their overall language learning - at least compared with the alternative for them personally, which may have been giving up if they couldn't use the language to output when it was such a largely motivation personal goal for them. Luke's interview in particular he started output on the earlier side: https://youtu.be/dDZgec6uzMs . So I'd say doing output before 1-2 years of study will not necessarily ruin your chances of learning/speaking a language if output is a big motivator for you.", "created_utc": "1630783271.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbloo9w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_phkl3d", "parent_id": "t3_phkl3d", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "These are all really good points.", "created_utc": "1630768724.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hbks3jd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pfpm9p", "parent_id": "t1_hbkkvqk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Part of it may just be you're only a few months in. Chapter 20 of Genki only a few months in is GREAT. You're doing really well. Reading for me felt like this up until year 3 so like just the fact you're trying in small doses already to look at some longer texts means you probably will find them less intimidating in less time than I did - I did not even risk looking at manga-length paragraphs until 2 years in, which I think held me back a lot lol.\n\nI think part of it is lack of cognates. Japanese has few cognates, outside of katakana. Whereas in any latin language, you can look and find thousands of cognates or words with similar enough stems/roots/endings to start guessing what they might be similar to in another language you do know. I studied french and simply from the carry over of being able to read french, I can brute force read spanish textbooks when I want to despite knowing no spanish except very basic 'hello/bye/how are you/thank you/1-10.' Japanese does not provide that benefit. I also study chinese, and having an intermediate level in that did happen to somewhat carry over when reading - making kanji much less 'completely unfamiliar with no guesses I could make about meaning given the context except grammar.' I started chinese at 2.5 years into Japanese, then re-picked japanese up after 2 years of chinese. And the increase in 'not totally unfamiliar' kanji helped a ton in making japanese less daunting when I see novel chapters.\n\nBecause japanese has a lack of cognates and similarities in word structure to languages you may know (for me that'd be english), you have none of that 'extra' stuff to lean on for context to help you. Increasing vocabulary is what helps the most. The more japanese words you know, the more kanji you see in multi-kanji words that may help with meaning, the more you might start running into a new japanese word similar to a japanese word you know - getting more 'similarity' benefit to make reading less daunting. At year 2 I quickly went through 2000 common words in an srs (Nukemarine Memrise and Genki), and then after that manga was significantly easier for me.  At year 3 I brute forced about 1000 common words by frequency (from Clozemaster in sentence context) that were mostly not on the other srs list I'd used in the past. That significantly helped. I think the vocabulary was likely the thing making large texts much less daunting, assuming your grammar comprehension is improving at a normal pace. \n\nGrammar knowledge also helps make sense of long texts - that's a benefit clozemaster provided. I saw so many messy sentence examples that were more like what's in manga and jdramas with slang and word changes, that I finally got used to grammar situations I hadn't been prepared for with my other grammar studies that were more textbook-example like. The more you understand general sentence grammar, the more context you have as far as at least being able to go: this is the subject, these are verbs in negative/past tense/affecting X thing in the sentence, this is a place, this is a time, this is an adjective, this chunk is about one thing and that chunk is about another etc. Then even if you don't know every word, you know generally if you need to look it up to grasp the main idea, and if its people talking to each other a good guess it might mean 'talk' if its a verb, or people+hand+verb+object you might be able to guess the kind of verb they'd be doing with the context you understand.

Your ability to perceive the sounds is probably improving, so you are noticing some pronunciation errors more easily now. Listening comprehension improves over time as you listen more and get better at it.\n\nThe more you notice pronunciation issues you're having, shadowing a pronunciation guide and trying to pronounce the sounds again and words may be a good idea. Perhaps you can catch specifically what you're hearing that sounds wrong and improve it now. I do that about every 6 months - go through a pronunciation guide I like again and do this to make sure I'm saying initials/finals/tones correctly. At least as far as my listening comprehension can tell. It's helped a lot. Using learner podcasts or textbook audio/language course audio may also be useful in a pinch. \n\nFor actual rhythm of speaking and sentences, like how phrases flow together, shadowing sentences and audiobook portions can help with this.

Do NOT let the name fool you or cover fool you into thinking this novel is in any way cute. Do not read this novel unless you have a strong tolerance for incredible levels of angst, horrific critique of society and the genres it contains, fucked up characters. Its an incredibly well written - and well translated - novel. It's fairly long but not Joy of Life long. Meatbun in my opinion writes as well as priest at least, perhaps better when it comes to long plots. It's xianxia and it uses the tropes, calls out the tropes, sets up expectations and annihilates them, and it all starts with 'the most evil emperor ever' killing himself and reawakening back as his younger self before he became 'most evil fucked up emperor ever.' Which is a wild premise to start with and main character to pick. The story then quickly establishes that: the whole world he lives in is pretty fucking brutal and cruel in general, many people are happy to hurt others, and a LOT of the narrations in this are hugely biased unreliable bastards who see the negatives in others and themselves before noticing if ever noticing or mentioning their good traits. This novel is also incredibly romantic, an incredibly fun and Heavy xianxia action with a lot happening, might as well be a phenomenally written glorified cookbook because you will want to cook every meal you read about in it. It has a cdrama adaptation Immortality that's been filmed and is awaiting airing with the dream best cast somehow picked. Back to the novel - its phenomenal, incredible, one of the best things I've ever read because I love biased narration and characterization and this story does it so well in heaps and bounds while also telling a tight very intense story. Any novel written by meatbun will make you sob and tear your heart to slivers and then piece it back together later. I have not heard of an author in the bl genre who writes more emotionally horrifically/tragically. If you think tgcf is 'too angsty' at any point probably should not read 2ha. If you think SVSSS had some tragic stuff happening but only endured it because it was presented with a very soothingly comedic narration? You probably should not read 2ha. 2ha does end happy but a lot of characters you will love will absolutely suffer and die, anyone in this novel will suffer tremendously, the whole premise is dark as hell and that should say something. If you like well written, want a good xianxia adventure that's dense and meaningful, want well written characters with satisfying arcs? 2ha is intensely meaty and such a good read I read over 100 chapters in a few days in the translation. Really though, mind the premise. I wouldn't say its particularly angsty if you can handle Evernight, other intense xianxia/wuxia, older cdramas. But if you come to these stories FOR fluffy romance absolutely do not read 2ha just because the title sounds cute and you think it will be more silly fun action fluff like svsss. You will absolutely not be getting a soft fluffy time. All that said, 2ha's main narrator has a very enjoyable dark humor which I do find lightens the mood a lot that would otherwise be bleak, there are a lot of hopeful warm moments between friends and lovers, food is a love language and scenes with food tend to be intensely comforting, and I do find the hero journeys in it very hopeful as there are characters trying to hard to help and do the right thing and make the world a kinder place to live in while thinking of themselves not much nice and generally living around/needing to handle such brutally cruel people. There is a lot of humanity and hope in 2ha. Which was a suprise to me when I read the premise which sounded like comedic fluff -not true - then a double surprise when the narration opens with a dark comedy tone/serious heaviness and 'I'm the most evil person ever let me show you what I've done.' I basically gave 2ha a shot because 1. it was recommended based on svsss as a 'serious' take on such genres - which like no if you loved svsss that doesn't mean some of the heaviest stuff ever is also your thing lol. 2. In The Untamed I loved messed up characters like Meng Yao and so the idea of a story going 'Hello I'm pure evil and I'm your narrator!' had me intrigued about WHAT a chinese novel based on that premise would even look like! Because quite often, in xianxia, anyone who is evil is 'evil' and anyone who is good is simply the hero. While there may be some nuance beyond that - LaR being an exception I love where that trope is very much not reliable - generally if you look like Meng Yao/Wei Wuxian/Mo Ran you are pure evil for story purposes. And anyone similar to you may be scapegoated, you will be scapegoated for any additional evil, you will be painted as evil even if some of what you did makes sense given what a hero did to you, etc. And a hero can be Heavenly Realm most-abusive Emperor ever aligned and still be considered completely justified no matter how abusive this hero is getting - see Eternal Love's heavenly clan versus Love and Redemption's version that calls this trope out. So for me it was a new thing to see a novel upfront say it will be telling this story 'from the villain's pov' when rarely is the villain's pov even considered. In summary: its a hell of a novel, I still use its food recipes, I have many friends still completely gutted in a 'I'm glad I was' way by the level of tragedy contained before its happy ending is reached).\n\nAnd some GL novel recs, to be fair!\n\n- Female General And Eldest Princess (Also known as FGEP, \u5973\u5c06\u519b\u548c\u957f\u516c\u4e3b.

I hear constant recommendations for this novel, Space time research institute and time travel, leading to a very Jade Palace Lock Heart time traveler type story set in historical China.

This is the book that got me into learning chinese, based on the drama that got me into learning chinese. The drama is xena/x-men/Buffy/Torchwood having a ridiculous time, and then I found out how much censorship tore the plot to pieces because the novel was not sci fi it was modern-setting supernatural which is not a genre they can make cdramas. Got the novel, have been reading it ever since. Priest writes a plethora of genres - sci fi if you like star trek eqsue things Can Ci Pin won the sci fi award in China and I know once I read it I'll be screwed because I'll love it too much, wuxia, xianxia, modern supernatural, MODERN wuxia which is WILD to me, mutants sci fi, Steam Punk Historical set in ancient China, Steampunk Historical set in victorian England, modern crime thriller horror - if you pick a genre priest has probably both written for it and mashed it with another cool genre. My personal favorites are: Guardian - which involves gods reincarnated, demons and ghosts, murder mysteries action and horror and is all my favorite genres mashed into one thing; Silent Reading - modern crime thriller/horror which is truly horrific at times and really fun to figure out the murders and probably my favorite for writing style, Tian Ya Ke/Faraway Wanderers - because all the main characters are villains in a wuxia and its fascinating watching two murderers try to carry out revenge/retire/accidentally adopt children and re-find their humanity. Tian Ya Ke \u5929\u6daf\u5ba2 just had a drama adaptation Word of Honor which was intensely well made, Zhen Hun has Guardian which is intensely lovable if you enjoy Buffy or Torchwood but very different from its novel. Popular novels by priest include: Can Ci Pin - which won national awards and is a very political future-set space sci fi, Sha Po Lang - Steampunk Ancient China, the Pope is a character in it, mech suits are in it, a cdrama adaptation has already been filmed and we are just waiting and I personally hope all the steampunk elements didn't get torn out, it is one of the Most popular priest novels in chinese fandom. Every novel priest also adapts a very different writing style - Sha Po Lang \u6740\u7834\u72fc to me reads almost like Lord of the Rings and 'old english fantasy' set novels and also reads sort of 'another time' in chinese, Guardian reads very horror, Silent Reading \u9ed8\u8bfb reminds me of reading english crime thrillers a lot and its chilling and probably my favorite style of the bunch I've read. Priest uses a large vocabulary for webnovels, and is very description thorough, but I do find priest readable even if challenging at first adapting to the new genre. Can Ci Pin \u6b8b\u6b21\u54c1 as you'd expect from a sci fi set in space has such a variety of names/cultures of humanity a la Star Trek setup so getting used to Russian/English/bizarre new-sci-fi names along with the made up sci fi terms for mech suits and mechanical things is an initial hurdle. Tian Ya Ke is the easiest of the bunch to read as an older novel by priest, much shorter like its predecessor novel Qi Ye - a reincarnation historical political, and if you know wuxia and palace genre terms can be read without much trouble. Zhen Hun and Silent Reading are fairly readable if you know modern vocabulary, horror genre and crime genre words. The Victorian London Steampunk I plan to check out too along with the other new sci fi novels priest's done recently like the wuxia-modern novel. Priest doesn't just write danmei either. The wuxia-modern novel is a BG novel \u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u65e0\u516c\u5bb3, Legend of Fei/\u6709\u532a is a BG wuxia novel/cdrama. Another space sci fi that is BG romance:\u963f\u82f1\u96c4\u65f6\u4ee3. Priest writes very plot heavy, so expect a very meaty world and story and romance more as an icing on top/thread throughout).\n\n- \u6d3e\u81ea\u6551\u7cfb\u7edf by mxtx (Scum Villain's Self Saving System, SVSSS, by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu. There is a donghua adaptation. There is also the Popular \u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 by mxtx that was adapted into the popular The Untamed cdrama. I personally recommend svsss IF you already have read a harem novel before, seen a xianxia novel/drama/donghua before, seen a transmigration story before, or are familiar with the tropes in such works. SVSSS is a satire piece, so its hilarious and written with heaps of sarcasm and humor. I think it may be the easiest of mxtx's novels to read, because as a satire novel it sticks to the obvious words and names for things, very genre usual easy words, the tropes are extremely easy to spot that way when they're made fun of or something interesting is done with them later you can tell what it was originally. Its super easy to read, has an easy to find funny audiobook, has the lightest tone 'emotionally' of mxtx's works, the simple writing style is nice for the humor, and if you are brand new to any of the genres listed above? It does take some time to lay out the basic tropes in the start of the story and call them out so you can learn what they are. Also as such it has some super common vocabulary for such genres so if you spring into a harem novel later, a cultivation novel, xianxia, transmigration, etc you will know some key words. Its not high art but I do appreciate what it does to call out webnovels, specific genres and tropes, and play with everything. The romance is basic, is there in a few chapters more center focused, but mainly this is a satire work. I also think if you want to get used to mxtx, its a good novel for seeing that mxtx is aware of tropes and how to play with them/notice them. Which is good prep for mxtx's other novels where such things are done in more subtle specific ways for specific effects. If humor is not your thing: then \u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 is the one to pick if you like horror/mystery/xianxia/wuxia and liked The Untamed. \u5929\u5b98\u8cdc\u798f is the way to go if you liked Heaven's Official Blessing Donghua, like angst/xianxia/ghosts or would just like to see mxtx's more universally liked novel/longest novel. All 3 have easy to find audiobooks, \u5929\u5b98\u8cdc\u798f is getting a cdrama adaptation. I have only read svsss so I can't speak for the others. I have heard mxtx does not write very fancy, which if svsss is representative I would agree with - mxtx is easy to read, but not thick with engaging beautiful descriptions and terror/beauty/awe like a priest novel. Upside is also not a brutal amount of potential unknown words. mxtx is a popular author so may be worth checking out just to see why so many people are into their stories? Which is why I initially checked out svsss. SVSSS I really enjoyed for how much it also taught me to recognize xianxia and harem story tropes/pitfalls, because in cdrama land for a huge range of shows that makes them easier to either tear apart and figure out why you hate them or realize they're doing something you like and figure out why you're enjoying them. I heard MDZS plays with some usual danmei tropes, along with grey morality and mob mentality themes, and breaks the usual xianxia tropes in some ways. TGCF I have heard is the most well loved but I'm not sure on it's themes, just that people say its incredibly sad at points).", "created_utc": "1630520538.0", "edited": "1630520739.0", "id": "hb7ub4j", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pf3e4x", "parent_id": "t1_hb7u68o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "What genres do you like?

It's available on youtube with a few readers who read it aloud while showing the corresponding text, as well as available on many other sites, in english-chinese book form, in english-french-chinese book form which is how I read it, etc. It's also referenced in cdramas sometimes).\n\n- \u7405\u740a\u699c \uff08Nirvana in Fire - if you enjoyed the cdrama, which many loved a lot, then the novel is also worth checking out. I personally only saw the first few eps of the cdrama but it was enough to know I'd eventually like to finish the show, and read the novel. The cdrama is usually THE cdrama I see recommended to people).\n\n- \u5168\u804c\u9ad8\u624b (The King's Avatar - especially if you already enjoyed the donghua or cdrama, because this novel is intensely long and has a very easy to access audiobook and text, so if you love it you could probably just study from it for a long while if you wanted. Language is also fairly easy as its mostly modern, with the more specific words being gaming/technology specific so once you learn them there will not be a ton of unfamiliar words or irrelevant words to daily life).\n\n- \u5e86\u4f59\u5e74 (Joy of Life - recent cdrama hit, a sci fi/period story with a lot of politics and intelligence, its a well loved novel and drama, like The King's Avatar this novel is HUGE and you will not run out of material easily. Because both the drama and novel I've seen so often recommended, they're both on my to-check-out list). \n\n- Any novel by Gu Long (I'm personally fond of \u65b0\u8427\u5341\u4e00\u90ce of which it was easy to find the text, audiobook, and translation - I happen to find the cdrama very fun and wanted to read the book. Gu Long's been recommended to me by friends, I love how straightforward he writes it is very readable and easy to follow, and if you either like the wuxia genre or would like to check it out and see if you do, he's a well known author in the genre. Gu Long wrote a ton of novels so its worth browsing and seeing which ones you personally might prefer to read).\n\n- \u5c04\u96d5\u82f1\u96c4\u4f20 (Legend of the Condor Heroes - another well known wuxia novel, a reason I've heard many people got into reading chinese and/or wuxia, I've had the 2008 cdrama recommended as several friends favorite drama ever, it has an english translation and is easy to get a copy of, there's also manhua if you're interested in reading that for fun. Again if you want to check out wuxia, this is one worth trying. This is my friend's favorite romance story, wuxia cdrama and novel). \n\n- \u7409\u7483\u7f8e\u4eba\u715e (Also can find this under \u7409\u7483. This is the novel that cdrama Love and Redemption was based on. LaR is my favorite romance-containing xianxia and one of the only ones I not only tolerated but loved, had some very fascinating themes and I've already read/listened to 20 chapters of this. Its also written very straightforward for a xianxia, so once you learn basic genre words or if you're already familiar with them from watching xianxia cdramas, it has a comfortable vocabulary and is relatively easy to read. It has an official audiobook, although I'm looking for fanmade ones because the official audiobook tends to end its sections in the middle of chapters. I highly recommend the show if you only watch one romance xianxia, because it both contains a TON of the tropes that are common to the genre and then does something different with them or completely anihilates them. If you've ever seen Eternal Love - which I did and hated, but also you may want to check out because for some people its THE top most-loved romance xianxia - comparing Love and Redemption to it was healing. Because it presented so many seemingly similar tropes then did such different things with them later on. Also was fascinating to compare LaR and its differences to Ashes of Love, 2ha, SVSSS - which plays with tropes using satire. It should be noted: if you DID enjoy Ashes of Love, Eternal Love, or Love and Destiny cdramas - corresponding webnovels exist and are easy to find if you'd like to read them).\n\n- \u76d7\u5893\u7b14\u8bb0 (The MANY The Lost Tomb cdramas are based on this book series. Do you like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, Lara Croft? Then this series is worth checking out. If you love anything ranging from horrifically bad to the point of hilarious 90s esque cgi to actually incredible cgi depending on the drama you pick, the dramas are also worth checking out. The writing starts off very simple and not particularly fancy - so I'd compare it to novels for pre-teens/teens. Then gradually the writing improves over the course of the series a bit, still staying fairly straightforward and easy to read. The plots are fun, the adventures are fun if you like tomb raiding stories and/or horror, and the main characters are lovable enough they've dragged so many freaking people into the dmbj pit lol. I love the series - very easy to find online as it has its own site, audiobooks I had to dig for but there are at least 2 that exist for the entire series and aren't very hard to find, and its also easy to buy physical copies of both several of the books english translations and the chinese novels. Also there's a translator who is making english translations of ALL other content not yet officially printed in english, so its very easy to find english clarification if needed. A great series if your reading isn't strong/you don't want to work to understand, and enjoy horror/tomb raiding/adventure stories. The audiobooks have a VERY horror feel to them. Its a long series that is Still getting new novels written for it, so you don't have to worry about running out of material. Additionally if you get into the cdrama versions, there are SO many shows to pick from and they range dramatically in strengths/weaknesses and the cast is always different so you may find some or all of those shows your kind of thing as well). \n\n- \u9b3c\u5439\u706f (Ghost Blows Out The Light. This series is what \u76d7\u5893\u7b14\u8bb0 was initially a fanfiction for before it spiraled into something entirely its own thing, is often recommended as written more stylishly, and is pretty well known. It's also fairly easy to read, recommended reading level is if you can handle HP then you can handle \u9b3c\u5439\u706f. It's also a tomb raiding horror action genre story, also has cdramas based on it. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy the genre).\n\n- \u4ed6\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u8bf7\u95ed\u773c by \u4e01\u58a8 (English title and corresponding cdrama titled Love Me if You Dare. I'd actually recommend anything written by Ding Mo. Ding Mo often writes modern mysteries, sometimes crime, and so the vocabulary is very daily life, professional, or mystery genre - all of which I like knowing how to read. The writer is often recommended to me for a good mystery novel, dramas based on the novels are also often recommended to me - and there's a few dramas based on Ding Mo's novels with actors I can confirm are great. Examples of cdramas based on Ding Mo novels: When a Snail Falls in Love, Love Me When You Dare, Memory Lost. Also the reading level is not very high for these, they're very approachable and straightforward to read if you have a good daily life vocabulary. I've heard the writing style is also nice. I have several Ding Mo novels on my list to read, and they are very easy to access both on websites and if you would like to buy print copies).\n\n- \u5c06\u591c (Ever night. A very popular cdrama adaptation of some of this story exists. Also a very readable edited machine translation into english exists. This novel is intensely long, intensely well loved, has several easy to find audiobooks on ximalaya and across the internet.

You will search novel name in chinese followed by either: \u6709\u58f0\uff0c \u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269\uff0c \u6709\u58f0\u5728\u7ebf\uff0cor  \u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269\u5728\u7ebf. If the webnovel has an audio drama TOO, be mindful of that and if you see the word for Audio Drama \u5e7f\u64ad\u5267 avoid those ones (I usually avoid any link that says \u5267 instead of \u8bfb\u7269), or listen to the audio file's start and make sure that sounds like narration and NOT mainly dialogue. Mainly dialogue - you're listening to an audio drama. All audio is matching the text of the novel you found (except maybe some transition words said differently) - you found the audiobook. You may need to search a little bit, as sometimes people make audiobooks which cut out several paragraphs of the text when read aloud. However, so many audiobooks are out there, I can generally find audiobooks that fully match the text and include everything (except for a few changed transitional words sometimes). So I recommend testing that the first chapter of audiobook matches the text before deciding to use a full audiobook's files. Also its quite normal for some chinese audiobooks to stop in random spots compared to chapter ends in the text. So be sure to keep track of where one audio ends so when you start the next one, you can start it from where you left off. Mostly I only have this issue with officially made audiobooks - fanmade audiobooks I've found tend to match up perfectly to chapter lengths making my life easier. Bilibili and google I'd recommend over youtube - because bilibili uploaders often break the video into timestamps for the start of each chapter (making life easier), and sites found through google are usually audio-hosting sites so you can just click the chapter you'd like to listen to. Whereas youtube some nice uploaders upload by chapter, some do not. \n\nAlso, if you ARE interested in audio dramas - bilibili often has chinese captions for audio dramas, so you don't even have to go looking for transcripts. Youtube usually has english captions for audio dramas, so that's more useful for if you know most of the chinese and would rather use english to double check comprehension or look up an occasional unknown word meaning. \n\nTruly though, google WILL eventually find an audiobook that matches the text of nearly any webnovel. I had to dig a bit for \u76d7\u5893\u7b14\u8bb0 audiobooks (which were way harder to find than The King's Avatar audiobooks), but eventually I found a site through google with all of the main books and all of the text included (only issue was it ends the section audio files wherever it wants instead of at chapter ends, w0hich sometimes happens with chinese audiobooks so that's normal). \n\nOther audiobook options. Go to a chinese site/app that hosts them. Ximalaya has tons of audiobooks (just search the novel title and often official and fanmade audiobooks and audio dramas will be on there). The site is easy to use without an account on a computer or phone web browser, and the app is easy to install. https://music.163.com/ is phenomenal, fanmade audiobooks galore (just search the name of the novel and \u6709\u58f0). QQ also has a ton of audiobooks (I think some fanmade and some official). https://m.missevan.com/ has a ton of audio dramas (that sometimes have chinese captions - if you turn scrolling comments on they're usually colored comments toward the bottom or top). Most audiobooks I'm using right now I've found on music123, ximalaya, qq, bilibili. I found them all through google just searching chinese novel names and \u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269 or \u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269\u5728\u7ebf\u3002\n\nThere's just a ton of audiobooks and online text for chinese webnovels, so do searches in chinese and you will find what you're looking for within a couple pages. Also - I've found the Sherlock Holmes books in text and audiobook (text on a site, audiobooks on youtube), Harry Potter series in text and audiobook (audiobook on music123), 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami, Agatha Christie, Pride and Prejudice, Alice in Wonderland. So you are not limited to novels originally written in chinese if you want a novel more familiar to you or closer to your reading level/topic desired. Additionally, Pleco app sells graded readers with audiobooks - so you can always purchase them in Pleco, then read the text in pleco alongside listening to the audiobook. \n\n*For 'a rough audiobook in a pinch' options:* \n\nFind your novel text through a search engine. Open the site you found in https://getidiom.com/ Idiom app (its free) - you would go to Reading section, paste the url. Click the headphones icon on the top of the screen - it will now play generated audio per sentence, allowing you to go back or forward as desired and pause as desired, while staying matched up to the sentence its highlighting as it reads. \n\nAlternately, on ios Pleco you can open any file (website or txt file you saved etc) and then click the megaphone button to have it dictate the text aloud (or highlight certain sections to only have those portions dictated with the sound icon). I just got a samsung so I'm still trying to figure out how to do something similar in this version of Pleco - but Idiom is working for me for now. In addition, several eBook readers (free like Kybook Reader and paid apps) can dictate text aloud. Also several phones can have Read Aloud tools turned on in the Settings-Accessibility section, which will allow your phone to generate audio for any website you find with text. I believe Google Translate will also read-aloud pasted in text in a pinch. These are all options if you want to practice ANY increased listening, even if its not a real speaker. They don't sound as good, but it is something. Additionally, in Pleco you can control speaking speed, so if you're trying to train yourself to listen faster or read faster you can practice comprehending an audio at 70%-80% speed then working your way up to 100-110%. Youtube also has video-speed options for practicing that if you'd like to practice listening speed with audio of real people.", "created_utc": "1630513137.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hb7c4il", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pf3e4x", "parent_id": "t1_hb52trv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I used to and still love photos for this reason. For a lot of my childhood, I'd rely on photos to know what I was doing as a kid - that I had birthday parties, who were friends, what I maybe did. I had a few memories but I mostly relied on asking other people what happened in photos, growing up, because I just couldn't remember any memories myself. \n\nI would imagine people who can remember their childhood don't need photographs to prove 'oh I went to the ocean when I was five' and 'oh I was given a guitar shaped cake' or 'oh I got to have a birthday party thrown especially for me at 8 because I begged' and I learned because there's a photo of us all in a hot tub and my family's told me stories about what happened. Or my family told me stories about a trip and that's how I 'know what happened' that and a photo. Sometimes memories will come back a little if I have a photograph or a video - usually still it's related to some friend. My earliest memories I can recall myself are as a toddler I had a friend and I remember saying goodbye when I had to move away, and I remember getting to watch my favorite movies and play games in my big sister's room when I was 5 and how her room looked, and I remember my friends a bit on my own. But most family events without photographs I can't recall at all and with them I just guess what happened or ask what did, I usually only remember the parts with my sister or my nieces. Like you can guess, in my teens I think I probably just got gaslit a lot because anything my family said happened based on a photo I just agreed with since I couldn't remember either way, and it wasn't until mid teenage years that I even realized parents can lie so much to kids because I realized just how much my mom was lying to me about a lot of things. \n\nWhen I hit pre-teens and teens I started having more memories if friends were in them, from then on I can remember some things fairly well and usually have friends I had associated with certain memories, or if they're family memories then memories of playing with my nieces and watching them. \n\nI wish videos had been a bigger thing when I was growing up. I know there was once a video of my birthday at age 4, and I had two best friends, and it looked like a nice party with a guitar cake and me getting to be with friends. And there was once a video of my sister's wedding when I was 14 where I could actually see how my family acted, how I acted. But those videos got lost, and mostly growing up photos were if we were lucky and it was a big event, videos were rare.\n\n*All venting below, feel free to ignore (unless I guess you've got some buried health related trauma too in which case idk maybe it might help someone):*\n\n It's also weird, that the more healing processing memory work I try to do the more I realize how much my cptsd is tied up in health issues as a kid. So in a way I sort of wish I could remember in retrospect how much of my parents acting controlling was them afraid I was dying/gonna die, how sick I really was. The more work I'm doing the more that seems to explain why they panic more now and regress even though sometimes they can manage to be respectful now since they're afraid I'll cut them out. \n\nI'm sick again, was dying again, and I do think they don't want me to die. I know in retrospect growing up a lot of the harsher stuff they did like not let me do climbing and intense sports, freak out when my chest hurt (I had a totally fucked heart that was killing me apparently), freak out when I Lied about pain probably because if I was in actual pain I was gonna have to go to the hospital, and tried to push me to do sports/be independent/how much they focused on me eating enough/too much sometimes after the second surgery to get strong to help with recovery, was them not telling me how fucked my health was and trying to just push me to do what might help without telling me. \n\nI didn't know I was underweight and dying as a kid lol they weren't gonna tell me I think they didn't want to scare me, they'd just get horrified when they hear people got into fights with me and had hurt me and react extremely trying to make me afraid to get in any situation where a stranger might fight me. Idk just like in retrospect I don't know how much was them failing to handle delicately how the hell to keep a kid alive that's dying by overreacting, and how much of my memory loss was me straight up blocking out memories of being in pain (which I know happens because I will still slip and immediately forget times when I've been in intense pain because it happens so often I try to forget bad memories). \n\nI know even the times in a hospital as a kid, literally all I can remember is how much IVs traumatized me from one nurse stabbing me over and over for a half hour because she couldn't get a vein in a 5 year old in the middle of the night, and my dad with me constantly, bringing movies I liked and movies I might like and having them play on repeat and trying to find things I wouldn't mind eating. I don't remember pain except that my 5th birthday I threw up and couldn't enjoy my party and hid and my best friend showed me hot wheels to try and cheer me up and that night I had to go to ER and it took a week to leave. My parents told me in retrospect about if I'd cried, screamed, had a fever, etc. My parents told me as an adult just how sick I actually was, once I was fixed and had been fixed a while and I imagine they were less worried. I just remember the needle as a kid which is why I'm still horrified by them even though I know they don't hurt bad now, why I can't watch anything medical in shows or documentaries and have to read any medical info in small doses because I feel too much phantom pain and fear, and I remember my dad trying to put on movies I'd like each time I went to the hospital. And its hard to forget the needle thing because I've needed so many surgeries as an adult I keep having to go through it again. \n\nSo much of them being pushy as an adult too, which was disrespectful, I think in retrospect was them afraid I wouldn't have healthcare and would ignore medical issues like they used to when they had no healthcare, when I get sick so easily and they don't wanna see me dying again, was them afraid if I move too far away they can't get the money to get to me and drag me to a hospital if I need one or check on me and make sure I'm doing okay. Even now I think mainly my mom likes hearing from me every so often mainly to know if I'm feeling okay or worse and if I'm worse then if I'm seeing a doctor and not just letting things keep getting worse. \n\nIt's not respectful at all when I was a young adult and I felt them trying 'any means necessary' to push me to make the choices they probably thought were safer for 'career' and 'school' etc, and I yelled plenty and they are trying to improve now, considering I'm finally at a point where I can call them out without being scared. And its doing them good to be more respectful now. But in retrospect I think a lot of the pressure I felt in college to 'do what they wanted' was probably pushed by them afraid of if I'd be sick all the time and over-pushing me to do what they figured were the safest things. Which just so happened to make me sicker from stress lol. When I got suicidal in college enough to scream at them they sure dropped their expectations to we just want you happy. \n\nI know part of their parenting was also having awful examples in my utterly horrific grandma which my mom takes after but tries hard to be not nearly as bad as grandma is (which was still awful growing up but I do realize my grandma was eons worse and its why I never see her), so like they fucked up and traumatized me plenty themselves. Just also like. Literally wasn't until this year I started realizing how much health related trauma I full on forgot ever happened and blocked out, and how much it probably only increased the problems. And just how much its still fucking me up now, going through health issues, when I have enough distance from my parents now that its literally just my own body and the doctors I have to constantly see terrifying me. \n\nI couldn't figure out why the hell my ptsd symptoms were getting so much worse again, despite ignoring parent expectations and moving away from them several years ago causing so much improvement in the past. It was because my health took a nose dive, and probably a lot of stuff I buried came back without me even knowing to look at it and try to work through it or handle it.", "created_utc": "1630511062.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hb771or", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pfre7x", "parent_id": "t3_pfre7x", "score": "2", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I second the workaudiobook software. Its free and really good for repeatedly listening to audio, looking at the transcript below it or not. Since I started Listening-Reading Method I've noticed large improvements in my listening comprehension over the past summer. But I've been mainly practicing with audiobooks and tv shows, so generally I'm hearing 1-to-1 conversations or a single speaker, not necessarily a noisy environment with many speakers. Still, if you're listening comprehension is really bad it could help a bit. Especially since you already have the vocabulary you just need the listening comprehension. I noticed the first things to improve for me was comprehension of words I knew fairly well from reading already.\n\nWhat I did was listen to an audiobook chapter (can be completely new if you want to test how much you comprehend, or a chapter you've read if you just want to see how much you can hear compared to read). Then the second time, read along to the text as you listen to the audiobook - your comprehension this time of the chapter should be fairly good, if your reading is decent, you'll pick up all the main ideas and most or all details. Next, reread any spots you were unclear on or need to look up a word on (only if you need/want to). Then listen to the audiobook chapter again on its own, as many times as desired, in the background as desired for when you're busy or walking/driving etc. You should notice that each listen you comprehend significantly more. Eventually after a few to several listens you will get to a point where you follow all the main points easily and at least most of the details. You can always reference the text once in a while if there's a section you're totally lost on (likely there's many unknown words in that section or words you struggle to comprehend when listening). Then, if you'd like to test comprehension, go to the next chapter of the audiobook and play it. See if you can comprehend more this time on a first listen then you could with the last chapter's first listen. And repeat. \n\nThis can also be done with: youtube videos while viewing the transcript (or using in Learn Languages with Youtube, Learn Languages with Netflix, Viki Learn Mode, Idiom app, where you can just choose to repeat specific lines until you comprehend them fully with and without the subtitle), short podcasts, learner podcasts, learner materials, any short news segment with subtitles and/or a transcript. I generally use novel chapters just because novels are easy to find text and audiobooks for, and I also get to improve reading skills during the 'read text' portion and learn some new words. \n\nI've done this activity with really short sentences in Clozemaster (unfortunately that's a artificial voice), Pleco (just highlight whatever text you want read, unfortunately also a artificial voice), youtube videos with Idiom, audiobooks with the webnovel, audiobooks and webnovel with workaudiobook, short podcasts (Slow Chinese and it's transcripts), short japanese lessons (2-4 minute lessons on Wasabi Japanese). This approach works fairly well for me and its improved my listening skills a lot. \n\nThat method can also be done very lazily, by just watching anything subtitled (shows, movies, youtube, news etc) and then just rewatching some or all lines repeatedly until you comprehend more. Glancing to and away from subtitles depending which time you're watching the video. But this really doesn't work for me unless my glasses are off and I'm watching something I already know well otherwise I'm too tempted to look at subtitles. Another option is making audio-only files (or condensed audio files) of shows you've seen (or searching for pre-made condensed audio files of shows you've seen - Eternal Love, The King's Avatar, Love O2O already exist like that). Then just relistening to the show audio several times. Since you've already seen the show, you know what happens enough to get more comprehension each time you listen. After several listens you will be surprised how much you recognize - if needed, checking the transcript or show subtitles once or twice to double check any sections that were super hard to comprehend before listening to those sections again. I found that doing this I ca now follow a significant portions of shows I like by audio alone, and it also got me much more familiar with a lot of conversational word-chunks people tend to say together. \n\nIn a pinch, if you're super crunched on time, I also find that just audio flashcards (hear chinese, then english translation, then chinese again - like Glossika, Clozemaster radio mode, japaneseaudiolessons, Chinese Spoonfed anki audio files), also have been improving my listening skills although at a slower pace. I play them in the background throughout the day, and since then I've started getting a much more immediate recognition for commonly said phrases and word-chunks, and more recognition in general just more quickly recognizing the words I knew already by their sound. \n\nAgain, I don't know how much these would help with following conversations with multiple speakers and noisy surroundings. But with one on one conversations it may help listening comprehension somewhat.

Mnemonics help, there's tons of anki/memrise flashcard decks out there if you search \"hanzi mnemonics anki\" or \"hanzi mnemonics memrise\" on google. Skritter is also an app for hanzi learning I've heard is good. There's also tons of free user made courses for chinese on anki and memrise if you search. \n\nI would recommend reading the following 3 articles for steps to break down hanzi into much easier to understand pieces. Hanzi are only made up of a little over 200 radicals, radicals are easy to recognize, and once you start noticing them it is easy to break hanzi down into them visually and remember them. Radicals also often hint at or provide pronunciation, which is nice. Articles: [How to Read Chinese Characters: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.writtenchinese.com/how-to-read-chinese-characters-a-beginners-guide/), [Learn to Read Chinese with Ease](https://www.hackingchinese.com/learn-to-read-chinese-with-ease/), [The 100 Most Common Radicals](https://www.hackingchinese.com/kickstart-your-character-learning-with-the-100-most-common-radicals/). And this is a list of the radicals with audio: [Chinese Character Radicals](https://www.archchinese.com/arch_chinese_radicals.html).\n\nI recommend the book [Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters: (HSK Levels 1 -3) A Revolutionary New Way to Learn and Remember the 800 Most Basic Chinese Characters](https://www.amazon.fr/Tuttle-Learning-Chinese-Characters-Revolutionary-ebook/dp/B00KV1SK1E). If you have never tried to learn hanzi with mnemonics or struggle to, this book is nice. It goes through 800 common ones (up to HSK 3), and has a premade story to help you remember the meanings, tone, and pronunciation of all of them. When I studied from it I literally just tried to read a few pages a day. I only got through about 500 hanzi in the book, but by then I was finding it much easier to recognize at least half of the hanzi in new words (I was doing 2000 most common word flashcards on memrise). And that made it easier to learn the words. Then once I had learned those words I knew enough hanzi roughly that I did not have many issues picking up more after that over time through reading. There are also many other hanzi learning books that may be of use to you if another method clicks better with you.", "created_utc": "1629835964.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ha7dtnr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_palwcq", "parent_id": "t3_palwcq", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "What others said - flashcards, some grammar if wanted, and active immersion.

I wish I could find the study right now, but it mentioned even comprehension down to like 70-80% can be enough to grasp the main idea, if you can tolerate that low level of comprehension. Most people can't 'comfortable' endure lower than like 95% without getting used to it, and generally all people tolerate 98% comprehension, so 95-98% is generally recommended for graded readers/classroom material etc. \n\nI personally find if its a language with a lot of cognates, I can tolerate like 60% comprehension because if its news or something I can use nouns for context, prior knowledge for context, cognates for context, grammar knowledge to guess some words, and get enough comprehension to get the main idea. With languages with few cognates, 80% is I think my minimum tolerance. I need to understand enough to follow the main idea at least to use the material (or at least follow the main idea if I am looking up a handful of key words that seem important). If you can follow the overall main idea its probably comprehensible enough. If you can follow more than that (like the main idea with zero word lookup, some details with or without some word lookup) then its definitely comprehensible enough to learn some stuff from context in it. That said, if you wanted to intensively study and look up every single unknown word, then any material is fine it just may be more tiring. I find personally, until comprehension gets to the point I can comprehend main idea easily without any word lookup, and some details without any word look up, I find it intensely draining to do. I still did it in the beginning a bit in shorter time spans to get to a higher comprehension. People have different tolerance levels, so go with what you can handle tolerating.\n\nSince you can understand every second sentence, that's great! You can learn something from it if you can understand some of it. Also, listening, sometimes I think the more you listen the more you comprehend (like re-listening). If each time you relisten, you understand a bit more, it may be worth listening a few times until you think there's nothing new you'd comprehend through the next listen. Also, listening with a transcript to reference for a while to ensure you're catching ALL words you know, then practicing hearing all those words without the transcript to reference. Generally reading materials, and stuff like comics with text and image, shows with audio and/or subtitles, are easier to handle at lower comprehension because the surrounding visual context helps you comprehend more. And using material you've already understood in another language or reading a summary beforehand, again so you can use prior context to help you figure out roughly more of what you're trying to understand.\n\ntldr: if you can understand some full sentences, then it is probably enough comprehension to learn from. If you can understand the overall main idea, its definitely enough comprehension to learn from. If you can understand some details too, or more on re-listens, that's great. If its tiring to listen to, you may want to look for slightly more comprehensible material for yourself until you find something more tolerable - or try using the transcript a few times to improve comprehension, then listening again without it.", "created_utc": "1629817379.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ha63gj9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pado3t", "parent_id": "t3_pado3t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "No. I knew as soon as I learned what pregnancy was I never wanted to be pregnant and go through that.

This is what I found valuable, you might want different stuff:  \n\nThe 2000 most common words (because then you can start reading with a dictionary/tolerate watching shows and pausing to look a word up here and there, can start to have basic conversations and follow some basic ones and again limit how many words you need to look up to follow the main point or describe yours). A ton of free lists, websites, user made anki decks, user made anki decks, many apps, have usually 1000-2000 common word study material. Its preferable to find a study material with audio examples of each word too, and sentence examples if you can (but it will still work if you use a literal word list etc). \n\nSpecifically, I like starting with these first 300 words: [\"You can say a surprising amount with ~300 words.\"](https://funwithlanguages.tumblr.com/post/105572981908/you-only-need-200-words-to-talk-about-everyday) That word list helped me so much as a beginner in multiple languages. As far as getting to a point where you can at least express yourself basically on a variety of topics, just look up key words, this list helped me a ton. The idea is you also have some grammar knowledge for conjugations/word order, so you'd still need to learn all the main word forms/grammar needed to speak basically. But these are great starting words.\n\nPronunciation guide. Look up a pronunciation guide on youtube or a search engine etc, go through it. It will help your accent and listening skills later. It shouldn't take more than a few days or a week, but you can spend plenty more time on it if you want.\n\nLook up a grammar guide or grammar guide summary online. Read through it - or if its overwhelming, just read through the basics section (so A1 or A1-A2). You're just trying to get an idea of basic grammar so you can use/recognize the words you're studying in sentences. And its totally fine if tons passes over you, you can always study more in depth more or look some things up more later. Whenever you'd like to. But some basics really helps start recognizing sentence patterns, construction, guessing which words are nouns/verbs/adjectives to help you figure out how to understand sentences. \n\nIf your goal is to visit a place as a tourist, have small talk, or prepare for a class asap: you might just want to look at that 300 word list, and find a good learner podcast to start. The 300 words will help with very basic conversational ability, then you can use a learner podcast to learn listening/general pronunciation, daily life/small talk/tourist conversations, and hopefully those kind of related words. And get an idea what topics to look up more words in because they'll be relevant to you (words for your hobby, for the foods you'll want to eat, allergies, etc). Podcasts like LanguageTransfer are good for getting used to grammar in a really easy way, Coffee Break French (or Your Target Language etc) is a great introductory course, Language101 lessons etc. \n\nThis is more how I studied when I needed to learn some Russian asap for daily life stuff: learning cyrillic a free website, a learner podcast (Russian Made Easy), a Russian Grammar Guide summary book with 2000 common words in the back (I did not learn all those words right away), that 300 word list, and looking up words people were saying/texting to me a lot. It was not as in depth and did not help with reading much at all, but it got me to being able to navigate daily in a household within months. \n\nIf you're okay with textbooks: tons of textbook courses teach the 2000 most common words, basic listening (and pronunciation if you practice saying it how the audio sounds), basic grammar. Teach Yourself is a really cheap language book that does this for a lot of languages (it covers stuff for daily topics/tourism fast and then still covers a nice basis eventually), Berlitz makes some nice cheap ones too, I heard Assimil books are good, and specific languages are going to have specific textbooks that are great. Likewise, if you just search \"learn X language\" on a search engine, there's some free sites organized just like beginner textbooks or courses if you want to just go through one.

I didn't notice any major damage because of early output.\n\nI do think if I had outputted without checking if I made mistakes (like chats with native speakers nowadays) it would be easy to get into the habit of saying incorrect grammar. So I generally think making sure you don't get in the habit of saying something which could be incorrect grammar/incorrect word usage is a good idea (like the advice to write and check beforehand, like asking language partners to be very critical in pointing out mistakes, assuming you aren't doing things perfect etc). Incorrect grammar is a habit I don't want to form, so I'm just mindful to be aware of it and make plans to study that a lot more with drills/writing before I plan to output more. \n\nYou're where I am at around 2 years in, and now is also when I plan to start outputting more - I can read and understand and listen well enough, I just think I need to do some more focused actual writing practice/grammar checking on myself. I know when I speak I'm fine to understand for partners but sometimes use odd grammar or word choice, and I want to minimize that more by practicing the right habits before I get into talking for long periods of time. Again though I think just having the mindset of 'I might be saying this wrong' and 'please let me know if I make an error' helps a lot. \n\nPersonally I think output as far as just pronunciation drills (tone pair drills, shadowing, doing apps where I'm graded on pronunciation and what portion is wrong, asking native speakers where I sound weird etc) helped me personally a lot. If I hadn't done that a bit throughout my studies, I think my chinese pronunciation would be eons worse. That may not be true for others, but for me just shadowing and pronunciation training was something I'm glad I started already. As a result my chinese pronunciation got much better than my french - whereas french I had waited 2 years to Start pronunciation at all and my french sounded horrific until then and my listening skills also suffered until then. (Which, even if someone just Listens to pronunciation explanations/examples as a beginner that helps a ton, they don't necessarily need to output I don't think).\n\nFor people who will absolutely lose motivation unless they get to output, I think its fine to output as much as desired.

To get my reading speed faster than speaking I have to stop subvocalizing in chinese, and obviously stop slowing down enough to be thinking specifically of each word definition. So the more I practice improving my reading speed, the less I tend to translate in my head or subvocalize.\n\nFor me it was kind of a progression, so as you continue learning things will start clicking 'instinctively' and you won't think about 'oh this phrase means x.'

So just in general, as you keep listening it will get easier and this may be an hour timeline to reach for. I personally noticed doing Listening-Reading type study activities more has helped my listening improve a ton over the past few months - where you listen to audio one or a few times before reading to pick out the sounds and anything you understand, then read and ensure you understand it totally by looking up anything if needed, then listening multiple times again sometimes with and without reading along until you can comprehend the audio on its own to some degree. That can be done with short sentences like flashcards with audio in anki or clozemaster or memrise, with short learner podcasts or textbook audio, with YouTube videos, with chapters and their audiobook files etc. Just anything I can get audio and text for.\n\n I imagine a large part of why I\u2019ve been making improvements is I\u2019m just doing more active listening in general now.

I found when I started them at the exact same time, I confused words/grammar just because I was learning the same kind of words, grammar, skills at the same time. So personally I prefer to stagger languages so I am not starting them at the same time or studying the same topics at the same time. I confused the two languages much less often when I started Japanese 6 months after French. You may have no issues though, and it\u2019s not an issue at all if just deciding on which one to start first.\n\nIf you eventually study them at the same time, like I did with my Japanese started a bit after I was already in the middle of studying French. Then keep in mind each language will make progress based on its specific study time. If you have 2 hours of study per day for languages, and study two languages then both will need share that time. So if you study japanese 1 hour per day it will progress like you\u2019re studying it 1 hour, versus people who can dedicate 2 hours per day to just japanese. My Japanese progressed very slowly because I could only dedicate 1/2 hour to 1 hour per day and Japanese takes more hours to hit milestones. \n\nIf you have more study time available per day for languages this may not be an issue. Ideally if studying multiple languages you have enough time do dedicate the study hours to each that you would if only studying one language. So Japanese gets maybe 2-3 hours per day, French 1-2 hours, total of 3-5 hours of language study per day (or whatever amount you\u2019d want). \n\nOne thing that helped me was switching between actively studying one language and mainly just maintaining the other, for a couple months then switching regularly. So French would get 1.5 hours until I hit a milestone and Japanese would get 30 minutes where I\u2019d make maybe a little progress or just maintain what I knew. Then I\u2019d switch to Japanese for 1.5 hours a day until I hit a milestone while French made a tiny bit of progress or just maintained. This way things go just as slow in the long run as if you only had 2 hours for language study. But milestones for a language get hit faster while you\u2019re focusing on that one, which I found a bit more motivating. \n\n\nAlso as others say, you can always just pick one to focus on first.

If I pick one I\u2019ve read before, I need to still be seeing a lot of brand new words in the chapter that I didn\u2019t learn last time (or I need to be listening to an audiobook for the first time to practice new listening of words). Audiobooks are a slight exception in that I will re-listen to them on their own and continue to find re-listening valuable until I stop hearing a decent number of new words I figure out in context per listen. I don\u2019t count listening to audiobooks on their own fully as study time (since I can play them while doing other things and they are partially review during re-listens). \n\nBasically - I try to prioritize studying something new or at least practicing a new skill each time I study. While I may do some review, I try my best not to let it take up more than 50% of my study time unless I\u2019m doing something like reviewing after a long break of not studying some skill (like a grammar refresher, or studying a bunch of Memrise words in bulk that I want to just be reviewed to 100% so I\u2019ll move on, or starting to study japanese again after a 2 year pause).

Some people like Lingodeer, Skritter for hanzi, and I've seen people mention many other good apps. \n\nI personally started with: reading a free grammar guide online (I read this beginning to end over a couple months http://www.chinese-grammar.com/ but also [AllSetLearning](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Beginner_Guide_to_Chinese_Grammar) has a wonderful in depth free guide you can always just read different sections as you progress), the Ben Whately common word decks [1](https://app.memrise.com/course/374/chinese-words-by-spoken-frequency-0-1000/) [2](https://app.memrise.com/course/376/chinese-words-by-spoken-frequency-1001-2000/) on memrise (although [Chinese Spoonfed Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/53920083)/[gumroad version](https://promagma.gumroad.com/l/IEmpwF) in the long run is my favorite chinese deck and I still use the [audio only files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MCKgOxzW9cd1u9cWjzGwWrpxnL5pDz0w) for listening to sentences and improving listening), [DongChinese's pronunciation guide](https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin) (great for learning initials/finals/tones/tone pairs), and \"Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters: (HSK Levels 1 -3) A Revolutionary New Way to Learn and Remember the 800 Most Basic Chinese Characters.\" \n\nI liked that book's mnemonics provided for meaning and sound, which made getting used to learning hanzi much easier for me personally and just a matter of reading through the book and then seeing those hanzi in my other study material. Later, using the app Pleco for reading is phenomenal, Pleco is also a wonderful dictionary tool. I did a lot of reading, watching shows and looking up words in google translate (though extensions like Learn a Language with Netflix, Viki Learn Mode, free Idiom app all provide click definitions and ability to loop lines if you prefer easier tools to look up words). \n\nIn the end there are a LOT of ways to study chinese, so take some time to look into what may actually suit you best. There are great app options tailored to Chinese, great lesson options (I've been recommended [Chinese Zero To Hero](https://chinesezerotohero.teachable.com/) courses if I want to study for an HSK level), lots of great websites, lots of great textbooks. As long as ultimately you cover studying reading, writing, listening, speaking all at some point (which in the beginning might just be pronunciation, some hanzi, some grammar, some vocabulary) you will learn.\n\nMain advice would be, if you are discouraged by slow progress, try to study 1+ hours a day. Ideally 2+ hours a day when you can. If you study less than an hour, the amount of days it will take you to hit milestones may be a bit discouraging if you like seeing fast progress. If you increase study hours, you will see 'faster' progress as far as days. And go easy on yourself if progress is 'slow' because chinese may just take more hours of study than maybe french would to hit a milestone, and that's fine and normal and you're doing a good job.\n\nEdit: also if conversation is a goal! Feel free to use apps like HelloTalk and Tandem early and try language exchanges. Early like within several months of starting. They might motivate you, you might use google or baidu translate apps a lot at first to text people, but you'll pick up some small talk skills faster, some active vocabulary faster, and that could be motivating if chatting is your goal! Also going the tutor route, with things like ITalki, if chatting is a main goal. Try to study what your goals are, so its funner for you.

Its the first time I haven't had to pay attention to even the chinese subs sometimes, and can follow when I'm sleepy and low energy. The genre matters in that I know I do worse with political historical/palace drama and business-driven where I can follow the main story and main ideas but not all details since I have vocab lacking. Whereas with detective, horror, wuxia, republican era, sci fi - those are genres I read, and have practiced watching (more intensively) when I started learning, so I find the watching the shows extensively to be easy to follow for all details with just a new word occasionally that is clear in context. That said, shows were not this easy months ago in the winter. It's tremendously easier lately, I wonder if the reading/listening focus I've had the past few months has helped.

And that means speaking skills in a year might be at least enough for small talk and casual travel to keep you motivated! While some languages take more hours of study to reach fluency, it just depends how much time you can put into study per day. If you put more study time in per day, you hit milestones faster as far as days. But even if milestones take more hours, it\u2019s normal and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing anything wrong.\n\nWith languages that take less time, it\u2019s just easier to see progress in a time span that\u2019s motivating - even when I only did French 30 minutes a day I saw fast enough progress during 2 years to stay motivated. But when I spent 30 minutes a day on Japanese (which means I\u2019d have needed more years of study) since I was hitting milestones so slow I got discouraged.

I don't find japanese confusing and I think people implying its 'super difficult' is why I gave up for a couple years before picking it up again. I just think for me it takes X times longer to get used to some concepts as far as immediate-comprehension on sight/listening and immediate-production. \n\nWith chinese I never had the fear it would be hard, even though its said to be (more specifically it is said to take more hours of study which I do think has been true to an extent). I had a chinese teacher in high school from Beijing, and he never acted like it was hard, and so it was never anywhere near as 'hard' as Japanese felt in college when despite an excellent teacher - the teacher and everyone else said it was very hard to learn. So when I decided to self-study chinese again as an adult from scratch, it clicked with me quite easily. I think part of it is that I never viewed it as 'hard' so I got to skip SO many hours I wasted in japanese on 'avoiding/procrastinating due to fear of difficulty' and 'postponing immersion for fear of difficulty' and 'drilling kanji instead of letting myself learn full words out of fear full multi-kanji words would be too hard.' In japanese in 2 years I barely could grasp a simple manga chapter's overall main idea with a dictionary for all unknown words, by 8 months into chinese I could read slice of life manhua with no dictionary and follow almost every speech bubble and easily the main idea of the chapter. So just by assuming chinese would not be hard, it was already easier to study and learn than a language I'd assumed would be 'hard.' \n\nAlso coming back to japanese now? It's eons easier, just because I try to approach it more like chinese now as far as assuming 'its easy too it just may take more time for some milestones.' So I waste much less time on 'preparing/worrying about difficulty.'\n\nOn a more personal learning level, I do think I learn Chinese a bit easier. I think for me grammar and writing matching sound is a much bigger hurdle than writing system, whereas for other people it may be different. So Chinese having hanzi that usually are pronounced one way with a radical hinting at it so I can learn a sound with one symbol, and having grammar that is S-V-O generally, just makes it so much easier for me to pick up. Whereas japanese S-O-V and other grammar aspects make logical sense to me but are so easy for me to forget and require me to study much more to remember and recognize, and kanji having so many multiple pronunciations really makes me struggle. In chinese, when I read and don't know a hanzi my brain will auto-guess a pronunciation, which the more I learn is more often reasonably close and I can look up the new hanzi or word containing it with pinyin. When I watch a show with subs or listen to an audio with transcript I can easily visually match sound to hanzi. With japanese, the fact I cannot be certain a kanji will not usually have one pronunciation and not always give me a hint based on it's radicals really trips me up. I had no idea I relied so heavily on listening skills when I learned, until I realized why chinese gave me much less trouble to learn the hanzi. Recently I read that sometimes onyomi kanji reading can be hinted at by radical, and that info alone has made kanji just that bit less confusing to me.", "created_utc": "1629171058.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h98vku6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p5pokh", "parent_id": "t3_p5pokh", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Sometimes.

But I loved chinese so much, it just built up momentum and then I was studying a lot more. \n\nI also sampled Spanish, I remember for a few months years ago I listened to learner podcasts and read a spanish intro book, I got somewhat into it and then had no time to really commit to studying spanish fully. Yet in some ways it still paid off - it let me know I wanted to study spanish more one day when I have time. The time spent studying spanish helped me make a clearer mental distinction between it and french listening and reading wise, which made french easier. It also gave me enough spanish background to be able to read a bit more spanish when I want to - which I'm sure will help motivate me whenever I get time for spanish again one day. \n\nI think its fun and nice sometimes to just casually look into some things when you're curious.

Right now listening is some degree harder, so that will take a while to improve. And my reading speed is quite slow, I'd love for it to be faster than speaking speed.

I have strong passive reading skills in French and have not studied in years since I can read what I want, I'm still working on my listening skills since I completely neglected them for years.

I also listened to Coffee Break French and Language Transfer French audios to practice listening/repeating a bit. That was enough to prepare for some basic conversation on a variety of things a bit more specific than just small talk, while not going super in-depth. If your goal is specifically conversations on a specific topic, looking up words related to that topic may help. Stuff like word lists on that topic, translating a short paragraph/story you'd say on that topic so you can learn specifically the words you would need to use/plan to hear someone respond. \n\nAlso for general conversation goals, getting onto an app like Tandem or Hellotalk (free, if you don't want to use a paid tutor like on iTalki). Then on the app, seeing if anyone would be up to do conversation exchanges/lessons with you. Where you could each teach each other half the time.

The focused work took 12 hours every few weeks, I was demotivated so I only could do a half hour every few days. But the payoff was now I can listen to audio at a level where I understand enough I can get some benefit just playing audio in the background to listen.

But at the same time, that initial study to get me here I just could not really speed up - since it tired me easily, it was only practical to do it a bit at a time. \n\nFor me personally, its good to force things a little bit - in the sense that if you have a challenging goal you need to make progress on, its worth it to try and do it each day/regularly if possible even if you can only do a little per day. Like reading a section of grammar a day, or reading for 30 minutes a day, or doing pronunciation drills 20 minutes every few days, if they're goals you need to work on etc. Even if they're burning me out a little - if the goal being improved helps make things I Can focus on easier, or makes it so soon I'll have more options for easier things to focus on, then its worth it. But for most of my study time, I balance that with things I'm interested in the most - even if that means changing my 'main goals' for a month to something different I can focus on more. Like one month for reading, the next for listening improvement practice, the next for pronunciation and talking with people etc and cycling so I'm doing what I enjoy most for the month and getting variety to burn out less. And on a daily basis, any study is better than none. Like this month I had planned to finish reading a novel I only had 7 chapters left of that I read 23 chapters of in a week.

I did this with an audiobook for a few months and now my normal reading speed is just a bit slower than speaking speed, whereas before it was much slower.\n- Reading stuff at your reading level/below it, with the goal to read fast. So time yourself on how long it takes to read a page/chapter/word count etc, then read it again aiming to be a bit faster. Or read another section of the same length in the same novel, or by the same author etc. With the goal to read a bit faster and time it.  \n- Time how long it takes you to read a chapter. I do this when intensively reading stuff above my level even. I notice over time it takes 1 hour to read a chapter, then 45 minutes, then 30, then 20, then 10, the more chapters I read by an author. So just seeing that you can see if the reading speed is actually increasing by reading more or not, and you're motivated to read a bit faster each time. This works better with extensive reading, but I do it with intensive reading to basically see how much the unknown-vocab/word lookups are slowing me down and then what my reading level is once I have gotten to a point where the novel is mostly extensive reading.", "created_utc": "1628866256.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h8sekk0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p3kbnz", "parent_id": "t3_p3kbnz", "score": "19", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Making friends.

If I can answer correctly, its 'passed.' I prefer it generally to anki because of that. Also memrise always gives me some new words per day, so I'm guaranteed to cover new words unless I purposely pick only 'review.' That's also how I go through 1000 at a time. A memrise course will have 1000 words, so I'll do regular sessions that give me new/review words and then once I finish the course it only gives me review. I think anki can do that too, but usually my decks are so big in anki I can't stop at like a '300 word' or '500 word' or '1000 word' cards milestone and only review for a while. And in memrise I can skip reviews when I want to just do new cards for a few days (again I think anki can do this too I just click with memrise better). Like I mentioned, once I finish a section in memrise I just review-only for a few weeks. \n\nIn anki I have to make the call based on how much I recognize the card. And that depends on how well I'm trying to learn it - in anki for going through a bunch of words for 'overall familiarity' I would pass any words I guessed the pronunciation mostly-right for and a generally-in-the-ballpark meaning. If I'm doing anki for very specific recognition, like when I did the new hanzi, I would fail unless I specifically remembered their pronunciation and a meaning that's correct (not necessarily the one key meaning on the card but at least one actual meaning the hanzi has). \n\nSummary: yeah basically I don't try to perfectly remember everything on a card before passing it, if I'm just trying to get a familiarity. I do that if I'm trying to do more serious review on topics though, although usually I don't use flashcard apps for that. With memrise I don't really have to make as much of a decision on it, since it tests with multiple choice so I'm either right or I'm wrong (but obviously the test method gives me hints on what the right answer might be). I just go through the deck. \n\nWhen I can focus on flashcards I can do 50-100 new ones an hour, 100-200 reviews an hour, so usually I'll do a couple weeks doing an hour or two a day, then the same with review for a couple more weeks. I can't always focus on flashcards though, often it takes me an hour to review 10 flashcards - and that's why I usually don't use flashcard apps as a long term study method for myself, because most other things I can consistently study more words per hour in some way. I usually can't focus on flashcards well. So the few times I can, I take advantage of it to do the 'cram sessions' of them if they'll help.", "created_utc": "1628376614.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h83va8b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oyvi5b", "parent_id": "t1_h815rx3", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "They aren't learned fully once I cram them, my goal is just to maker them somewhat familiar. How I use flashcard apps is the same as I'd use a word list in a class - reading it a lot, reviewing it a lot in a short time, then going to go run into the words in reading. Except apps schedule when I review for me during that 'cram period.' I keep re-learning the words as I actually read and re-look up any words that didn't stick, get review of the words that did stick by seeing them regularly. So although I cram 2000 words in a couple months, they are not fully learned until a few more months of running into them in reading/watching shows and looking up anything I forgot. But the cramming means I can jump into reading and a Lot more words are familiar/I vaguely remember, so its more like review than learning those words brand new. Which feels less overwhelming to me. \n\nI found the 2000 words by common word lists. If I use an app, many people have made anki and memrise decks of \"2000 most common words\" or \"5000\" or \"X common words in sentences\" (sentences with audio is probably ideal, but even just word with audio works ok for me, I study grammar elsewhere). Then I just do 50-200 cards in an app a day until I get through them (some days only reviews or none if I'm tired), then once I'm through I keep doing the reviews-only the app tells me to do until I no longer can focus on flashcards. For chinese I did 2 weeks to get through 1000 cards, then I just reviewed them the rest of the month. Then I tried reading, and reading was still quite difficult - a lot more 'recognizable' common words but still way too many lookups for me to tolerate per page. So then the 2nd month I did 1000 more words throughout the month - at a more normal new/review pace. Then after month 2 I went back to trying to read, the first 1000 words were much more solid for me, the 2nd 1000 were vaguely familiar, and looking up words while reading was less daunting. \n\nLikewise, when I started chinese I read a book for 500 hanzi mnemonics, started reading graded readers, and then several months later after studying the 2k words and reading webnovels a few months once I ran into too many unknown hanzi per page I went through an anki deck and did 1500 common-hanzi in a month. About 1000 of those hanzi were probably review since I recognized them from reading or the 2k words, the anki deck just gave me some structured review. Then 500 were hanzi I'd only run into in reading, and seeing them with their definition and pinyin and having the structured review helped them become easier to recognize in reading. The 1000 hanzi I recognized took a few days to get through, then the 500 took a month or two to study and then review. Then I stopped having as much trouble with them in reading, and stopped anki. \n\nBasically the words are NOT fully learned when I cram them. I'm just cramming that initial 'get exposed to their meaning and regularly review' for a short time. Then afterward immersion is more accessible because a lot more words are 'somewhat familiar' and I can transition to looking up 'familiar' words I forgot but can re-learn easier, retaining the words that are common enough I kept seeing them enough to not forget them, and then after a while those words are learned and I can just focus on looking up brand new words in immersion. Which is how I prefer to learn. I just cram the very common words, because they're likely to show up a ton in immersion so if I can just study/review them upfront enough to be familiar with them, I will see most of them often enough in immersion to keep 'ending up' reviewing them either by seeing and remembering their meaning again or recognizing them and looking them up to jog my memory.

I'll have one or two goals like this per month, and most of my study will be related to it - unless I switch up the plan to a different goal I feel more like doing. \n\nI also like doing 'challenges' to myself based on the goals. My goal for last month was to learn more japanese words, and I was also curious how much you could improve just using Clozemaster - so I challenged myself to use Clozemaster for a month and see how much it improved my japanese. When I started chinese I'd read some article of a guy who learned 2000 words from a specific memrise deck then started reading in Pleco, so I tried to do the same thing for 2 months (which worked out surprisingly well). This past month I read The Word Brain book, which mentioned listening hours in a target language. So I challenged myself to listen to as much chinese as possible this past month and see if it improved my listening skills - a lot of playing audiobooks I like in the background, new audiobooks too, getting to watch shows with english subs and consider it not totally slacking off lol at least for now since I'm also checking if I can hear the chinese lines okay. I read an article on how many X words a person had to read to get to 'reading fluently' in a language, and that motivated me to set more concrete goals of trying to read more X characters in chinese this month, and see if I'll see any improvement (that's going super well). Several months back I read about the usefulness of extensive reading, and that's what had pushed me to finally try reading extensive reading in chinese without a dictionary (and to learn strategies somewhere between intensive and extensive in general to help with making reading easier). I tried shadowing one month for a similar reason - someone had an article on how to improve pronunciation, and I try language exchange apps every several months when I feel like chatting instead of just doing things on my own.\n\nReally just doing what you want. Whatever gets you to engage with the language, what makes you excited or motivated. I'm excited by doing, so as soon as I can I try to push into real reading or listening - and if I do study like grammar/vocab-flashcard-apps its with the goal to see if it will help with one of these tasks in a month when I 'try again.' My only 'rule' for myself mostly is to Mainly aim to cover New Material. If I'm reading the same book over again, it should still have a decent number of new words I don't know. If I'm re-listening to an audio I should still be noticing significant amounts of new stuff I'm picking up. If I'm reading grammar, some part of it should be a new clarification or me practicing something I can't replicate yet. If anything is entirely review, I can review it long enough to realize what I needed to but I aim to move on quickly. Because I have a tendency to just try to dwell and stay stuck on the same thing without end if I don't push myself to move on, and that can really limit how much new stuff I learn.

I forgot everything but very basic active vocabulary - but it comes back when chatting with friends if they say words I used to know first (to remind me), otherwise it takes a few weeks to get my active vocab back. My grammar production I lost a lot of though unless I review a little bit before writing again (speaking its less noticeable since I can't make spelling errors speaking).

I studied japanese for 2.5 years before I dropped it, and it only took 2 months of pretty casual review to get all of my old japanese knowledge back and then pick up where I left off.

I can't focus on flashcards for long, so I just crammed 2000 words for a couple months then didn't use them again. Once I got to the point I could read with a dictionary, then I could reinforce words I'd 'seen before' in flashcards, and pick up new words. I find with less cognates, I need more 'basic vocabulary' upfront before I start reading or I'll get frustrated. \n\nHowever chinese and japanese are still sort of 'nicer' in this regard a little bit. With chinese, the more words you know the more hanzi you learn. And some hanzi are much more common. So eventually you start running into a lot of new words made up of either ALL hanzi you know or at least one hanzi you know. And then most new words have at least radicals (building blocks of a hanzi) you recognize. So the more words you learn in chinese, the more you start to run into elements similar to words you Already learned which feels much more like cognate-help in langages like French. Now that I'm getting back into japanese, words with kanji also have this 'help' for me since I now have some vague familiarity or guess of the new word's meaning, and japanese has a decent amount of english loan words too (at least in video games). So once I got a base couple thousand common words learned in japanese, I also run into more new words that have at least some help in guessing their meaning from just looking at them. \n\nI am not sure if this would help for Hungarian. This helped me with Russian when I studied it for a while though. Look up if some word endings, word roots etc, are equivalents or mean something similar to english or french or portuguese ones.

That's what I've been doing and its improved listening skills a ton.\n\nIf you don't make sure you understand the text beforehand, then the words you'll learn to pick up in listening will mostly be words you already knew how to read but couldn't recognize in listening well. So if you make an effort to learn the unknown words in the text, you can learn many of those new words too in listening and reading while doing this. If improving vocab isn't a goal, then picking material closer to your reading level is better. If you want to pick up new vocab without looking up words ever, youtube videos are probably better for a while since you can see the context and guess what some new words mean. \n\nListening Reading Method specifically is reading a translation text, then listening to the audio in your target language while reading along in the target language, then listening in the target language while following along/glancing at the translation transcript translation for any definitions/clarification. And then listening as many times in either of those ways, or without text, as helps you. As I did it more I noticed listening to target language while reading target text, and listening with no text repeatedly, were helping my listening comprehension a lot. But this can be done with small audio segments like short learner podcasts, textbook dialogues, youtube videos with a transcript, or with book chapters etc.", "created_utc": "1627998582.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h7jwchn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_owy7bc", "parent_id": "t3_owy7bc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm realizing this month, what I probably need a lot of is to just let myself make mistakes and be messy.

Put on kanji if you're more than a few months into learning - its easier in the long run to learn the word's usual spelling (if its with kanji) when you first learn it. If you have an app that shows furigana that's always nice too - when it shows hiragana above new kanji. A lot of mangas have furigana for some kanji, which may help sometimes. If you wait to learn the kanji version of the word then you'll have to learn that part later.\n\nThis part is going to be different for different people - if you find kanji difficult to get used to at first, for me I found it helpful to study kanji a bit themselves before adjusting to just learning them as part of words. I thought the book by Tuttle [Read Japanese Kanji Today](https://www.amazon.com/Read-Japanese-Kanji-Today-Language/dp/480531432X) helped a lot, its free in a lot of libraries and college library databases as an ebook. Some people also go further and study kanji with Heisig's Remember the Kanji, Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course, kanjikoohi, etc. While all of them may be helpful, I liked the Tuttle book because it was just a few hundred, gave me practice learning how to recognize radicals and start learning kanji myself, and then I could apply that to learning regular vocabulary. I found when I spent too much time learning kanji in isolation (like with RTK) then I personally just spent months on very few kanji instead of learning vocabulary which would've speeded up my progress. So for me, just some basic practice learning to learn kanji, then moving onto learning kanji in words worked best for me. \n\nAlso there's an app some people learn kanji and vocab on - I think it's Wanikani.

Granted, I did not have a great study plan either. But it does make me think 1-2 hours is probably a better minimum for languages that may take more hours of study to hit milestones, if you want to see milestones faster which can be more motivating. \n\nI put 1-2 hours into Chinese a day for the past two years (excluding rare days I was just really into something and the off days I skipped completely), with a more focused on my goals study plan, and I can read manhua fine without a dictionary, watch any show without a dictionary and any show for most to all details if I use a dictionary, can read some webnovels without a dictionary and some with, and can listen to some audiobooks if either an easier level or based on something I've already read. Much more motivating progress and that was just 1-2 hours a day, which after the first 8 months went from 50-75% srs flashcards or textbooks, to almost always all just reading, listening, watching things I wanted with a dictionary or practicing chatting with language partners, or shadowing for pronunciation practice. I still will need more focused writing practice later. \n\nEventually you can make a lot of your 'study' time things your goal was to do in the first place so its funner. And things you'd do anyway in your target language - read, or listen to stuff, or watch shows, just in the target language. Chat with people online, just in the target language. Play on a study app for practice (like anki, clozemaster, duolingo etc) during time you'd kill time on your phone for a few minutes anyway. And once you are doing things it was your goal to do in the language (or at least smaller scale versions of those goals), its motivating and generally you want to keep going - even if you take days or weeks off studying sometimes. \n\nAll that said anything is better than nothing. At 30 minutes a day you will eventually reach your goals, its just it may take more months or years since your hours studied are spread over more days. I took japanese slow, and I still made progress - and I still take it slow, and its still improving. It's just going to take more years. Being aware of how your study time per day affects how long milestones take helps you keep perspective - if you only study a little, its okay if milestones take longer you are not 'never going to learn.' And if it frustrates you milestones take longer, increase study time per day. \n\nYou won't suddenly forget everything. If you study and forget some things, it will come up again and be reminded then eventually fully learned, that's fine. If you ever get demotivated or burned out because the studying itself is burning you out/not fun, sometimes its nice to just do something with the target language related to your goal. Like watch a show you love subtitled in a language you understand better, reading about a place you want to visit, reading a favorite author's novel translation, listening to music in the language, getting on a language exchange app and engaging with people etc. Its not study, but it might remind you why you want to learn the language so bad when you started and what you eventually want to in that language. So when you go back to studying you know what you are excited about and what you're working toward learning to do. Another thing to do if feeling burned out - if its just the study activity you're annoyed with, look into some other activities or methods and try them for a while.

And if it turns out to not be the right pick for you, then pick the other.\n\nI studied both. Chinese has a ton of learning resources, and for what I'm interested in actually seems to have a lot more. Its much easier for me to find chinese audiobooks, webnovels, comics, shows, donghua etc with subtitles or that work with my click-dictionary tools, including finding anime and japanese plays I like with chinese subtitles. Whereas with japanese shows I like I have struggled to find subtitles as easily, struggled to find the webnovels and novels I'm interested in unless its a print copy or through amazon.jp kindle which I'm still figuring out how to access, and so mostly I play video games which are easy to get region free and then look up words with a phone dictionary. I struggle to find audiobooks for the novels I'm reading. \n\nIn general though, both languages have a huge amount of accessible materials - and a ton of great learner-tool resources. The media being slightly harder for me to access for japanese just means a little more lookup work, or buying more physical copies of things - and I know there's people who know a lot more than me about how to get access to much more media and where to find it. In general, I find lots of language partners and tutors for both languages. \n\nFor me personally, I started with japanese for 2.5 years and progress went very slow because I struggled with the very different grammar and kanji with multiple pronunciations. After, I switched to Chinese and found hanzi and grammar much quicker to pick up and got into reading/watching/listening within a year. The grammar just clicked with me easier, and hanzi often have one pronunciation, sometimes hinted at by a radical, which I think clicked easier for the way I learn. I need a general sound-to-character match or I take longer to remember things, and with Japanese I generally have to match sound to specific words since kanji pronunciations change depending on the word. Now I've picked up japanese again and its been easier with a background in hanzi, and more patience on my end with me learning the grammar and having more realistic expectations of how slow I tend to be picking it up. The multiple kanji pronunciations still make me stumble a lot but its easier a bit now that I have basic recognition of the radicals/general forms so written japanese is less difficult. \n\nJapanese grammar I like for how logical it seems to me, but I struggle with because its hard for me to get used to thinking in its structure. Chinese grammar I like for how easy it was for me to get used to following and understanding. Shadowing and pronunciation guides help with Chinese tones, learning to listen is not too difficult. Learning to speak probably depends on the learner, I benefited from talking with people who would point out if I pronounced something wrong so I could catch it, and from shadowing with apps like \u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u5b66\u4e60 that point out specifically if I said a syllable wrong so I can pinpoint it (generally shadowing just helps even if it's very simply done with whatever audio you want). Japanese has pitch accent, which has its own challenges and I am still working on - so its pronunciation is in some ways very straightforward but there are things that to me are challenging. Basically there's easy and hard parts of either language, depending on the person. \n\nSimplified or Traditional - you would eventually learn both unless learning for a specific region. I learned simplified and traditional was not hard to pick up during/after, and learning japanese kanji now there are some changes to characters. Simplified characters often follow a pattern, there aren't as many changes are there are total hanzi to learn, and once you're used to learning hanzi then it gets much easier to recognize. You would probably pick which characters more immediately help your goals - if you plan to read books from Taiwan asap or have a friend who uses traditional you might learn traditional first, if you often watch shows with simplified subtitles you might learn simplified first. If you have long term goals that are specific, then pick which helps with that goal. \n\nIn the end both are considered to take many hours by the FSI estimates, so my Chinese may have improved faster just because I studied more hours on average in 2 years of Chinese, compared to 2.5 more sporadic study of Japanese. Since they both take a long time, maybe pick the language you care about doing something in. You'll want to get to that goal sooner.

Also though, its fine to do less or none some days and more other days - like on days you have more free time doing 2-4+ hours (like binging a show you like, playing a video game, reading a novel) and other days no time or only time for srs flashcards if you do them.

I've had to set that kind of expectation before with friends or partners just cause I have a lot going on and don't have time for my friends/family if I'm with a partner too much, or don't have time for my own stuff I'm working on if a friend wants to see nearly every day.

I mixed up Spanish and French a ton. \n\nI did a lot more listening practice - went over French pronunciation again, went through learner podcasts with lots of listening, basically I needed a much better mental sound for French. Since I\u2019d learned mostly by reading, it only sounded a bit different than English in my head (yikes) and when I heard or read spanish my brain would just mix up words and sounds. \n\nThen I also did that when I started Spanish - I did a lot more initial focus on sound, on listening and learning to recognize, so that I wouldn\u2019t have that issue as much. It helped a lot, building better distinct mental sounds of the different languages helped me keep words separate and recognition more separate even when reading. If sound/spelling is not what\u2019s getting confused together for you, then it might be grammar? In which case maybe going back to basic grammar overviews and noticing particular features of the specific languages and specifically Differences they have. But I\u2019m not sure how much that will help grammar differentiation so there may be other exercises to help with that.\n\nAlso, to a degree especially as a beginner I find that I just \u201crecall\u201d words from the wrong language.

When I began studying Japanese and was intermediate in French, I\u2019d accidentally say Japanese words when I tried to speak french for a few months until my Japanese got more solid. That tends to happen whenever I started a new language - it just sort of temporarily interfered, then was fine later. I think it might also be just the new language not having a firm mental \u2018space\u2019 yet. And I currently recall Chinese words immediately because I use it regularly, so when I need to speak or write French my active vocabulary gets recalled less instinctively (just because I\u2019m rarely using French lately).

I would not get it despite reading the point a few times from different resources, but then after a few months just focusing on reading and shows it just started 'making sense.' Like I needed time to mull over it before it would click. \n\nI've been trying to treat japanese more like that this time around - focusing on vocab when grammar doesn't click, focusing on reading when I'm burning out from studying vocab specifically, and rotating what I do.

If I take a full break from studying its usually a week or two, and if I'm intermediate then a week to a couple months tops. But the longer the break, and the less I know, the more I need to review when I get done with a break.\n\nAlso if there's a particular grammar point or skill type frustrating me that I just can't 'get' then sometimes taking a break, to work on another skill helps. So like I mainly read for a month or 2 and get demotivated by how hard it is, switch to just practicing pronunciation for a few weeks and watching a show. Then when I go back to reading maybe I like it now because I want to listen to an audiobook alongside (maybe I just wanted a new way to do it) or I just missed a story and wanted to go back, or a grammar thing I didn't get before finally makes sense. Or, I'd taken those 2 months reading as a break from pronunciation and when I go back to pronunciation I find what used to be hard is not as much of a struggle. I could also apply this to switching which language gets the 'bulk of study time' per week compared to the 'lesser study time' if I'm burned out and want to feel refreshed/get a short break so I can come back with it clicking easier - those breaks between languages aren't as big though since I'm still studying both regularly its just a break from intense study of one.\n\nSo, breaks where you stop focusing on one thing/aspect and switch to another, then go back in a week or month? I find those help me a lot, and its how I study. I just focus on 1-2 main aspects for a while then when I feel frustrated/bored/burned out I switch for a while.\n\nI did take a 2 year break from japanese that really helped, but it was I think super lucky that I even managed to relearn the old stuff and also super lucky what I learned in the 2 year gap happened to help make japanese indirectly easier lol. I don't think in general a gap that long is ever a good thing. My longest 'useful' gaps were like 1 week-1 month. This just happened to work out since I'd already been just barely pushing into lower intermediate before I quit japanese (I tend to retain info/get it back easier once I'm intermediate), and when I came back to it after 2 years I knew 2000 hanzi which happens to indirectly help my japanese now since I rarely need to learn to recognize new kanji I'm just learning specific meanings/new pronunciations for words. Still a lot to learn, but one huge hurdle is gone that existed the first time I studied. And I happened to have all my old study materials so I could cram through them in a couple months and everything came back and clicked, and then I could move onto new stuff. Would Not recommend breaks this long on purpose.

There are some things you can do to get help: any pronunciation you're unsure about, use half the time to ask your partner. I did this with tones in chinese and I was so brutally bad, but it helped so much. Do more of the language exchange in writing - and type your portions in french more often. If most of the speaking is practice for them, then get in practice where its easier for you. Practice might be easier in writing where you can look up words in a translator/dictionary, and have more time to think up a response. This helps build up your active vocabulary a little so conversations are easier when you want to speak, and you can get grammar corrections in writing so you can save them to study more later.\n\nI didn't do this - but depending on how beginner you are/where you're at, having comprehensible-discussions for your half could be cool. Kind of like [video lessons](https://youtu.be/bxrz7WyXp8k) this youtuber does with people. Or [Comprehensible Input French's videos](https://youtu.be/c2SUQVjklVA) (but with 2 people). Basically, video chats where she'd gesture when she speaks french to help you follow what she means, and maybe use some pictures she points at or has on the screen to help show what she means. Talking about things you want to know how to talk about. This is the deep end as far as: you could eventually talk about a lot of things, provided during the french part you have gestures and picture context and she helps you figure out the words you'd want to use from that context. Although, this may also be something you'd rather do with a tutor (or someone just as beginner in english so you put in about this much of effort during the english talk half) if this might be more than you two are up for doing.\n\nI ended up just doing a language exchange a few months to improve my pronunciation and active vocabulary.

Usually asking that, I figure out any big grammar errors or word errors I made and since we have time to talk about it I usually remember the correct way after. Pronunciation, I had to make a point to ask how it is and if anything major is wrong - I'm guessing nothing major is since my language partner said it was understandable, and corrects when I speak by just saying the word's right-pronunciation if I say it too unclearly. But I find it hard to get pronunciation feedback so I may need to ask in other language exchanges. \n\nWhen I'm unsure if I'm making the same kinds of mistakes, I ask after the conversation. Especially if the language partner isn't the kind of person to correct you mid-conversation. Then its easier to pinpoint what to work on before I make a bad habit.

In the long term, this works out ok if I make it a challenge like: \"I'll try clozemaster for 1 month and use it the way X person said they did, get through 1000 words, see if I have improved.\" Which makes me study since I want to prove if it worked or not for me. Or what actually started me in chinese: \"This Y guy did these 2 memrise decks, read a grammar guide, then started brute force reading novels with a click-dictionary and it worked - I'll try!\" It took me like 8 months, and I also read 500 hanzi-mnemonics in another book first because I knew I'd need extra help and that had helped me before with basic japanese. But overall, I copied his study plan and in month 8 I was able to start reading graded readers, and simple webnovels with a click-dictionary. And from there it kept going well as I tried other stuff.\n\nOther things I tried: mass immersion approach (called Refold now) suggested immersing asap and as much as possible - so I added trying to watch shows and look up unknown words/read and look up key words/etc a bunch of tips from them and saw if it helped and kept doing what did, people who did Nukemarine's LLJ memrise courses (I tried about 1/2 and it helped me so much), learning 2000 common words when starting a language to make jumping into reading asap easier (read that tip back for french and did definitely help I pushed into reading with a click-dictionary by 5 months), reading through a grammar guide for an overview before pushing into reading (this tip worked great for me for french and chinese but japanese needed way more work, not every tip works for everyone), doing Listening-Reading method to improve listening and reading skills (currently doing).\n\nIf you tend to jump between methods my main advice would be: just try to Always prioritize learning new material even if you switch study methods. So if you study vocab one way like in a textbook, then switch to anki - immediately cram through all the words you already know or mark them as known or something so you're mainly learning New stuff. If you already did a textbook, and you switch to Assimil or some app - again push through anything that's review or skip it and mainly focus on what is New information to you. You can review the familiar stuff to a degree, but I think the main thing with switching study plans is it is Very easy to just get into a loop of repeating basic stuff and not 'making progress.' So try to purposely make sure whatever you're doing is mostly challenging and new for you, outside of review time. Then whether the new study method is good or sucky for you, at least you're constantly learning some new stuff and making some progress. If new methods constantly kick you back to 'restart' then just stick to one method until you get to a new milestone (like A2, B1, etc), stick to it for a few hundred hours and see if you're making any noticeable progress.   Often no matter how good or sucky your method, you'll make progress after enough hours. One reason I think Refold works so well is it encourages immersing a ton (immersion both helps in study ways, and also means More Study Hours per day). FSI's language programs probably work so fast because they're studying every day for a lot of hours - that helps. More study hours is going to result in more progress as long as part of what you study is new challenging material.\n\nSome small milestones like 'understood a bit more of a show compared to 2 months ago' or 'read a graded reader and didn't have to look up words i did 2 months ago' or 'texted someone and didn't need to look up as much in a translator as last month' are good small milestones to see if over time your study method is working for you or not. If it's not, consider what about the method is not motivating you or helping your goals, so you can pick something better to do instead.\n\nFor sticking to a specific method (or methods): think about your personal goals for the language. Then think about the short term goals that would lead to it. These goals should guide you - if a study method is not directly or indirectly building skills to make those goals possible, it might not be the method for you. If you want to talk to friends in a language, then avoiding conversational vocab and production practice and listening skills may demotivate you or not pay off until you eventually add them. If your goal is to read X novel, then looking up advice on how to learn to read in a language asap will have methods more suited to that goal (whereas getting a tutor to practice conversation will not cover those skills as fast). Etc. To a degree, you'll eventually need to learn reading, listening, speaking, writing. But for specific goals you might prioritize what you study and therefore what methods you do in different ways.\n\nSome methods I think are solid if someone is motivated and it is adapted to fit their goals: [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap/), this [language learning guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ssDz8y-ykOBhI5Uu33Ghq8-AabAs0qzQ9ZI2T6hyss/edit), Comprehensible Input (see youtubes like [Learn Korean in Korean](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJhoF0nZwaVPSPNPIQhLmg) to see how this teaching style works), Stephen Koffman (he has a youtube and runs LingQ - I don't use LingQ but I did use a lot of his advice), classrooms or textbooks or free online courses (provided you also continue to seek out new challenging material, learn more words beyond it, and practice reading/listening and learning new words from that outside of it), [The Word Brain's](http://www.thewordbrain.com/) guide is very straightforward, translator Kato Lomb's book on how to learn languages. \n\nYou could just look into one of those, or a method you already found, and see what suits your goals and motivation/enjoyment, then copy it for a few hundred hours and see if you make progress.\n\n*A note about Refold: I actually don't mind immersing in content I only somewhat comprehended, I'd look up key important seeming words and practice hearing/reading the parts I knew, and it got me comfortable 'quickly' understanding the things I knew faster so when I learned more I only had to work on 'practicing understanding' the new stuff. Some people will find immersing in hard content too draining/brutal, in which case learner sentence flashcards, podcasts, graded readers, textbook dialogues, comprehensible input lessons, are all good 'intermediate' transition materials. I used graded readers/podcasts in between short attempts with native material from months 5-12 in chinese until eventually shows felt less 'draining' to follow with occasional word lookup, same with webnovels. I wasn't strict with 'must understand X' just 'need to follow main idea with a dictionary at least' which is how I handled french a long time ago so that's why I was already ok with the more draining early attempts at immersion. If nothing else, early immersion is cool to see 'what little you Can actually understand' which is better than nothing, and see in X months how much more you understand in comparison to last time. First you catch nothing, then main overall plot, then main plot without dictionary and some details with dictionary, then main plot and some details without dictionary, then a lot without a dictionary, then a lot without subtitles, etc. \n\nCovering the 4 skills - learning enough basic vocab to start reading/listening and looking up new words or learning new words from context, learning enough basic grammar to start recognizing it and then practicing comprehension in reading/listening, eventually practicing grammar and active vocab with writing/speaking alone and with others. They might suggest different ways, but that's the goal. And what you prioritize depends on your goals. \n\nYou could learn completely from apps and the internet if you made sure you were doing activities to eventually practice all 4 skills: so some app to learn a ton of base vocab like a few thousand ideally with sentences and audio but not necessary (anki, memrise, clozemaster, lingodeer, etc), some grammar guide or resource to glance through and/or reference (a full-grammar app if it exists or free website grammar reference or book, Korean Lessons+ app), something to practice reading (graded readers, the internet), something to practice listening (audio sentences in any app that has it, learner podcasts, any material on internet, shows, etc), something to chat with people (HelloTalk, Tandem, tutors, etc). What milestones you've hit and your goals at the time will determine what thing you're focusing on at a certain point. \n\nI personally: read through a grammar guide, go through a short pronunciation guide and writing system explanation, if its chinese/japanese then a character mnemonics resource for a few hundred, then learn 2000 words in memrise or something, then dive into watching/reading stuff and looking up words. After that - listening to audio alongside text as I get better at reading to work on listening, eventually audio only stuff, shadowing to improve pronunciation, chatting with people more eventually, and trying out new methods to see if I like something new. I haven't worked much on improving speaking/writing to be smooth so I'm still exploring what ways work for me.", "created_utc": "1627052970.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h698u60", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_opns51", "parent_id": "t3_opns51", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm reading through this now, thank you for sharing it.

But it may be harder to maintain a steady passive and Active ability in multiple languages maybe because of time needed to juggle to keep them all maintained.

And I have been running into the same issue.\n\nWhat's kind of been helping is just reading multiple things in the same genre, and rereading some materials. I've been slowly working through a novel intensively that's written fairly high reading level for me, so there are tons of new words but also the author does not repeat many words they use in long descriptive passages. So I can't really get re-exposure to the words unless I reread again later extensively, or re-read again while following along with an audiobook. That's what I've mainly been doing, since repeated listening helps with listening skills, and then once I recognize the word I can start listening-only without text to review the word more - and listening-only to audio in the background is easier to make time for than re-reading entire chapters.\n\nAnd with the same genre - I read two other things this month in the same 'murder mystery supernatural' genre, and its boosted my reading comprehension a ton. One story was written for kids, so it repeated all its vocab constantly and was easier to for me to pick up 'more obscure genre words', then the other story is the harder-novel I'm working through that uses such a varied vocabulary I see new words but rarely see them often, then a third novel with a medium-reading level for me where they use a lot of obscure but useful words from the harder-novel and repeat them more often. So I'm seeing the 'obscure' words enough to start remembering them easier since I'd imagine they seem more 'important' to my mind since I need them for multiple things. \n\nSomething I think would be effective, and take less time if vocab  improvement was my goal instead of just reading improvement: doing what I'm doing but with specific-subject arcticles/blogs. So find out a niche of rarer words you want to learn (perhaps sci fi genre words, or words about web design), then look up short sci fi stories or articles about X web design topic. By reading several, for a few weeks, hopefully there'd be more exposure to the rarer but useful-here words and they'd be needed often enough your mind would recognize they are important. In my case, that's what I'm doing but on a larger scale of novels, and I keep rotating a few since just reading one novel doesn't give me enough vocab being encountered repeatedly on its own. edit: maybe doing anki along with some concentrated reading on a topic using the obscure words you're focusing on at a given time, would help with more repeated-exposure to obscure words while still getting anki's benefit.", "created_utc": "1626796361.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h5vyquu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_onwxow", "parent_id": "t3_onwxow", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "As far as using spaced repetition, if the rereading has spaced repetition built in like this then it will also likely be similarly beneficial to using a SRS flashcard program/app.\n\nReading in general also has built in random repetition of words/grammar, and re-reading just adds to that random repetition which in particular would help get a lot more repetition of important common words in context and also more repetition of rare words. Likewise, the anki user would have a card for rare words (if they make a card for every single unknown word) so they'd also get extra repetition of it.\n\nI think the bigger difference is the anki user does not do any extensive reading. Adding extensive reading as a 2nd read through would give them a chance to practice reading through full paragraphs and build up reading speed, as well as reinforcing reviews with the random repetition reading has. Without an extensive reading at the end - the anki example ends up Only intensively-reading with some review. Whereas the rereader ends up both intensive and extensive reading, so they get the benefits of both activities. \n\nIn reality, both of these cases would make vocabulary improvements from the intensive reading and then review afterwards (both spaced repetition reviews, one in anki and the other in rereading). It depends on the person on what they'd prefer to do and therefore be motivated to actually do, and how much time each process would take. Intensive reading would take equally long for both of them the first time. Then if someone had tools to make it easier, and can do flashcards fast, the sentence mining+anki portion may take less time to make and review compared to repeated re-reading. However, the anki user example gets no benefits of extensive reading. So they may need to spend more time later building up those skills. So overall, for equivalent reading skill and improvements? They'd probably in the long run take similar amounts of time, assuming both people were motivated and could get themselves to do the activities. If the anki person skipped extensive reading until later, they might have the same vocab/grammar improvements but need to build up reading speed at a later point. I think it ultimately comes down to just what motivates a person better.\n\nIn practice, I think people could make either of these activities take up less time if their goal was to either 'stay motivated' or 'get through material faster to read new material/find new vocab.' They probably wouldn't pick up quite as much new info per book, but could probably skip some things. \n\nAn anki user could: choose to only look up some words during 'intensive reading' that look like key words for understanding or that they want to learn - this would lower the amount of anki sentences to make and review, and allow a reading experience a bit closer to 'extensive' reading  as eventually they look up less and less words as they complete more of the book. They could get a bit more extensive reading benefit, still choose to review rare words they find valuable. They would also get more chances to vary intensive/extensive reading to get benefits from both activities. If they have a helpful tool, they could even run their novel through a program beforehand that automatically selects words to learn and generates the sentence mining material so they could just entirely extensively read while doing anki reviews. \n\nAnd a re-reader could: choose to intensively read just Sections of a novel, until they know enough words to also do more extensive reading than intensive reading. Then just re-read the sections extensively, that they read intensively before. Or instead of rereading, pick a new book next in the same genre or by the same author for more 'random review' of a lot of words while also getting exposed to new words. Or during re-reading extensively, following along with an audiobook so they can practice listening skills too (and drag up their reading speed if its slower than speaking speed). So the re-reader could choose to do extra stuff with their re-reading activities to make them feel 'fresh,' and vary intensive/extensive reading during the first read through to keep the reading speed from getting too slow/intense.", "created_utc": "1626793785.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h5vskqp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_onz79a", "parent_id": "t3_onz79a", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "412 wpm english, my native language.\n\nLast time I measured it in March, I was reading about ~145 characters per minute when extensively reading chinese.

I've gotten my panic attacks to happen less (1-3 times a month usually only if I'm stressed, versus multiple times a day years ago). And I am working with a therapist right now to practice coping through them so they end faster, and I'm safer during them. When I panic, sometimes I punch myself or try to hurt myself badly over and over until its over, like I'm trying to make it end/make myself act normal so I won't 'upset' others by panicking and breathing funny/crying. I know its not logical when I'm calm, that it wouldn't end it and just is bad for me, and I'm allowed to cry anyway. But when I was growing up I'd be yelled at if I breathed funny, or cried, or frowned, or looked anything but pleasantly happy so in my college years living with parents I started beating myself brutally during panic attacks to try and keep myself from noticeably crying. If I cried, I would be in huge trouble. If I hit myself viciously, I would be in less trouble. So I am guessing it became ingrained as a reaction. \n\nI'm much better at not doing it as a reaction when I have a panic attack alone, or can leave the presence of others. But when I'm stuck in a social situation, or a time-sensitive 'mistake' like spilling boiling water or spilling oil in the middle of cooking or trying to do my taxes and its time to submit and I realize I made a big error but need my taxes done (percieved mistakes are what trigger my panic attacks I think). Then I still often end up hitting myself during the panic, like I'm trying to remain calm enough to finish handling the situation like I did in college. Even tho I know it never actually calmed me down, just made me panic longer, once I'm calm, also its dangerous and I am more afraid of doing it than the panic attack. \n\nLately its been much better, the therapist's tips are helping a bit. The only things that made me panic the last couple months was my car brakes completely failing in the middle of busy traffic, my car breaking at home (didn't hurt myself), my mom calling and asking me to do something and when I tried to give her a compromise that I Could do since I had a fever she got mad (panicked I guess since I had no solution possible to make both her happy and me able to do it), accidentally spilled boiling water on my hand while making coffee (panicked cause it hurt/was a huge mistake, didn't hurt myself more in a panic thankfully). I only hurt myself a couple of the times during a panic instead of all, so its an improvement. It still just scares me. I want to figure out how to keep myself safe from my own instinct to hurt myself during panic attacks, and the therapist is helping a bit but the process is taking time. And I just wonder if I'm going to have to deal with these panic attacks for my whole life.  \n\nIn my dream last night, at some point I lost my shoes, and started panicking and punching and slapping myself over and over trying to be 'calm' enough to stay in public and keep looking long enough to find them. It sounds silly maybe, but things like that have really happened before, I've had awful random times where losing keys or my phone felt like a 'mistake' enough I had a panic attack and tried to fix it. That dream scares me because I know that can still happen, I could do something totally normal and forgivable like spill water or lose my keys and end up panicking and hurting myself.", "created_utc": "1626789300.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h5vihlg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_old2d0", "parent_id": "t3_old2d0", "score": "1", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "You're doing good. 990 more words and grammar practice you've probably gotten in duolingo is a lot and you're doing a good job. And it looks like you are looking for new materials now to hit new goals you have like a textbook for more explanations etc. It's great you're making those decisions based on your own needs and what's working.\n\nIf you're curious, I've done a bit of looking into duolingo and if you 'can' learn a language with it. The short answer is - if you're spending more time on it per day (so more study hours in general per day) that helps, if you branch out once duolingo no longer meets all your study needs (some people branch out into immersion and/or textbooks or courses, sounds like you also are as needed), then yes it can be useful. Or similar programs like Lingodeer. I checked once and I think lingodeer and duolingo had around 2000-3000 words per course so that would be their vocab limitations for learning. I think the biggest thing that they tend to get discouraged for, is the use of them only 5-30 minutes a day is usually not enough on its own to progress at what most people consider a reasonable learning pace. Most people who've used it to learn a significant base used it in bigger study time amounts. So you're doing good right now getting the most out of it. I used duolingo to get some of a base in russian before switching to textbooks that suited me, and it was useful. It's like you said - if its useful depends a lot, like any study method, on if you can do it consistently and not give up. (I think of this video I saw once when I think of a person who used duolingo https://youtu.be/ht-w2JriwSw)\n\nI agree with you - the 'best' method in the world is absolutely useless if you can't actually do it and therefore don't, therefore don't study, and so you don't actually learn the language. I can't focus on flashcards much, usually after a short time it will get very hard and I won't be able to do more than 10 an hour at most, so I give up. Whenever I tried to do study plans that recommended anki daily etc I would just fail after a while, and studying only worked out because I'd vary what I did as needed into things I could actually do. Which for me, happened to be reading mostly with a dictionary but no flashcard apps to speed it up usually. And more recently, audio flashcard files to listen to, learner podcasts, Listening-Reading method, shadowing. Some people say wait to speak, or speak right away, I did it when I felt like it and it was the way that got me to keep studying. \n\nEveryone is going to be able to stick to different kinds of study plans, and in the end whatever gets a person to keep studying consistently and make progress they want to see is 'good enough' for them. Even if a person can determine what study methods will be most efficient, if they can't personally stick to them then they aren't going to be as useful for that person.", "created_utc": "1626701736.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h5r1dpn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_on5jrn", "parent_id": "t3_on5jrn", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Idiom app is free, as long as you can open the file online you can click individual words for definitions, and hear it read aloud. \n\nIf you have iphone, anywhere on your screen you can highlight a word for definition (it is based on keyboards you have installed I think so install the German keyboard), and if you turn on the Screen Reader tool in settings you can also have anything read aloud.\n\nIf you have a Reader tool - Kindle app, Kindle, I use Kybook Reader (free app on my phone), google chrome, probably others - you can again just highlight a word for a click definition/click translation.

People will have to do something to review what they study - whether that is anki, spaced repetition review of physical notes or flashcards they made, randomly spaced review of words/grammar through re-seeing them in shows/novels etc. Anki is basically convenient srs flashcard software, but doing spaced repetition can be planned by studying other ways (with another srs app, just immersing in certain ways with review built in, physical notes etc). So in the long run everyone's probably doing some or all of those, and will eventually learn.\n\nSpaced Repetition is why anki helps, along with anki being an easy tool to quickly make flashcards/use other people's shared flashcard decks. A person can get the same benefits if they review what they learn on the same spaced repetition intervals, without anki or any app (but then they have to keep track of the intervals whereas apps keep track for you). So what matters more is if someone reviews regularly/on spaced intervals, or if someone rarely reviews. A regular reviewer may review more than they need to but progress fine, a person reviewing on spaced intervals will save some time and progress well too. And if a person rarely reviews they will progress slower. (I count seeing words frequently as reviewing too, in a sense, so in immersion when you re-look up a word you've looked up before, or re-see a word you have recently learned the meaning of so you recall the meaning again, since its recalling the information again - so a person who frequently immerses is getting in regular review of at least some things).\n\nFrom personal experience: I think anki/srs software speeds up how fast I can 'learn' some things, just because it is timed to get you to remember something quickly. Whereas if I study on my own random schedule or relying mainly on immersion, I'm not planning the ideal review intervals so some stuff takes me longer to pick up. But on the flip side, when I'm not in the mood to do flashcards 10 cards will take me 1-2 hours - versus immersion where I can cover a lot more words in 2 hours if its mostly comprehensible/just above my level. So I usually do not use srs flashcard apps when I can't focus well on them, since I'd rather do whatever keeps me studying personally. \n\nI think using anki/spaced repetition specifically as a beginner shows the most gains in terms of speed, for me. Because at the beginner stage most input is not very comprehensible so I learn quite slow from context, but with flashcards (if I can focus) I can get through 50-200 cards a day, 1000-2000 cards a month, and learn common words and grammar in a few months and largely retain it. SRS gives me the initial exposure to the information and keeps me reviewing it on a timeline I'll be more likely to remember, then seeing the same information in immersion solidifies me remembering it. At which point I no longer need srs for that information since its eventually showing up regularly in immersion once its in my long term memory. And as a beginner, covering a lot of basics, gets you a good basis of 'comprehension' with immersion material, and at that point learning 10-20+ words any time you immerse from the context becomes a lot easier to do. Because you already understand a decent amount. Whereas if as a beginner I used no SRS, how fast I would 'remember' all those new words may not be as efficient, so I wouldn't have a basic comprehension level of immersion material as quickly, and wouldn't be able to learn new words from immersion as quickly.\n\nI've done no anki for french - but I did have a common word list, a grammar guide, and reviewed 'randomly' which probably wasn't as efficient as spaced repetition but it was something. I initially learned words slower, but french was close enough to english it did not slow down my progress to a point I disliked. Whereas Japanese and Chinese, I used anki and memrise for a while to get a 'basis' in the language. And until I did that, my initial progress as a beginner was slow enough it annoyed me. Whereas after I learned a bit over 2000 words in chinese, progress was fast enough from immersion and looking words up, that I felt happy with the speed of progress without SRS like anki. Also personally I just cannot concentrate on flashcards well, so using anki/memrise etc long term I end up getting very slow like 10 cards in an hour, and so I tend to switch between strategies.", "created_utc": "1626370603.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h5arz7f", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oboplv", "parent_id": "t3_oboplv", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This is cool to follow.\n\nMay I ask: how often (a rough guess or somewhere it was documented) do you pick material where the context is familiar versus new?\n\nI read your motivation page, and I have been wondering if picking materials we have an easier time understanding (made to be easy to follow or we have prior context), would create better results for learning from input alone.

Mainly, you get a chance to look up new words in a dictionary app as you're curious - maybe 5-10 words an episode or video. When I started chinese, I would watch with dual english-chinese subtitles, and it helped me pick up some basic phrases and also made it easy for me to pause and notice if something said might have been a key word/important word so I'd look it up on my phone because I was curious what it meant. Also just watching stuff you enjoy motivates you, if watching the show is enjoyable to you. I found for me, until I understood maybe ~80% without a dictionary and the 'main overall idea' of the story with dictionary lookups of key words, I felt too drained trying to focus on shows with only target language audio/subs. So that's why I did dual subtitles for a while, and it wasn't really a study activity with dual subtitles as much as 'just for fun' looking up some new words. \n\nFor me, I didn't see a quickly noticeable benefit for me to watch shows in only the target language until I could mostly follow the plot with word lookups every few minutes, as far as learning new words/sentences from shows at a quick rate. I do think watching shows from early on gave me motivation to keep learning, occasional practice to see where my skill level was at and push myself, and get me looking up a few new words every day while seeing ones I'd learned over and over.\n\nIf its subs in the target language, and audio in the target language, its giving you exposure to the sounds of the language.

It's going to reinforce anything you study - so noticing pronunciation you've studied, words you've just studied, grammar etc. And its just giving you more hours exposure to the sounds of the language and focusing on them. The book [The Word Brain - page 24](http://www.amedeo.net/wb/TheWordBrain2015.pdf) suggested 1500-2000 hours of listening exposure to develop the ability to parse the sounds of a new language.

When I watch childrens cartoons my listening comprehension is better because I know every word, and the story is obvious. Also depending on the language, cartoons have no subtitles at all so nothing to rely on. But I would rather watch shows with big plots I'd have watched anyway, so I don't do this much. \n\nLately I've been using Listening Reading Method to improve listening skills. For me, that has basically been: listening to the target language audiobook while reading along in target language, then listening to target language audiobook while glancing at english translation for reference when there's an unknown word. Then afterward, I just listen to the audiobook like when exercising or walking or in the background during simple work I don't need to concentrate fully on. The more I listen to the audiobook, especially since I already know what it should say, the better I get at listening. Now I can often just skip the english step and just do chinese audio-chinese text, then just chinese audiobook listening in the background. \n\nA mini-version of this, which I've found also helps, is finding a learning material or short video or flashcard-like thing (like Clozemaster). I will listen to the audio a few times in a row (since its a minute or less in length). I will try to hear every word, and figure out all the words I can, so 3-4 listens. Then I will look at the target-language subtitle to see what it said. I'll also look at the english translation if there's a new word (clozemaster, learning materials, short learner podcasts, videos with english/target language subtitle options are all great for this). Then I'll look away from the text again and listen 3-4 more times until I can 'hear' every word in the sentence and know what it means. Then I go to the next one. This also works with shows that have english and target language subtitle options. I might just do this for a few of the short scenes in the show when I feel like it. Replay it a few times, just trying to listen and not look at subs. Then look at chinese subs and english if I need to, replay and listen again.

To me srs flashcards are study, just as reading a grammar book, doing a course, an app etc would be, in that all of it is purposefully studying. So yeah immersion working well can sometimes mean the person does also use other study methods. I think it depends on the person on if they 'only' like sentence examples (so very little explicit grammar explanation) or grammar books/videos etc (more rules stated outright). \n\nI personally like reading through grammar guides and learning a lot of common words before I try to immerse often, so that I am already aware of the grammar patterns I'll look at and am just practicing recognizing them and understanding them in real time, and so enough is comprehensible from the common words that I can just look up some more key words in a dictionary to follow plots or pick up extra stuff from context. And then still - I know people who continue to do srs flashcards like anki, or textbooks, are probably making progress faster than me since they're studying explicitly more than me. I explicitly study sometimes as an intermediate learner, but I know if I did it more I'd improve faster. Related though, I do feel its thanks to immersion that I really drilled the language I 'do' know enough to recognize it quickly, which may have been less fun to drill vocab etc this much through explicit study. Whereas reading a novel interests me, so drilling all those words in a novel by re-reading and repeatedly looking up was more fun and got me to do it. \n\nI remember someone did do a test to see if pure immersion, very very little prep work or outside explicit study, could cause language learning. I can't remember exactly what they did but it was like immerse in French shows aimed at adults for a year straight everyday. At the end of the year they were maybe A2? It was a low level, but they'd learned something after many hundreds of hours. So it is possible to learn from truly immersion only but its not particularly faster. I remember when someone did that, people mentioned the experimenter might have had more progress if they started with kids shows or learner material to pick up basic vocabulary faster - that way later on the shows for adults Also would've been more comprehensible, so they could've learned more from them quicker. I agree with that, and I think people who do 'immersion based' study often do some prep work by reading a grammar guide or notes, watching some beginner materials or learner aimed stuff, or doing srs flashcards for a while like a few thousand cards, and that kind of stuff helps make the immersion more quickly become more-comprehensible so they can learn more from it quicker when they immerse. Or in the case of people who have taken classes to B1 level in school, they could probably benefit noticeably from immersion at a reasonable speed, since they probably comprehend enough from immersion to improve with it at a pace that's noticeable while perhaps being more fun to them than another textbook. Or just easier for them to motivate themselves to study by immersing, or just they have enough base knowledge that its practice-comprehending-material in real time that they needed to develop which immersion helps with.", "created_utc": "1626102235.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4xdqnb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oi9ssd", "parent_id": "t3_oi9ssd", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "When I was studying japanese, it took 2+ years to start seeing the basic progress of: being able to read very simple manga and understand the overall main idea without a dictionary, being able to watch a basic anime while looking up words and follow what's going on overall. So you are doing really good if you're following some shows! I knew about ~1000 words when I was able to start doing that stuff, and now about ~2500 words as its getting easier, and video games are becoming doable. So you may know a lot. \n\nJapanese has a large amount of hours needed to hit milestones so its just slower progress compared to some languages. What helped me at some points was upping study hours per day, because japanese does take more hours, so if I kept my study time low then it took more months/years to see milestones than I wanted to wait. Also learning more words asap for japanese, since there are very few cognates to rely on unlike languages like French. So at year 2 I crammed ~1000 words in memrise in a couple months, and that is when I finally started making progress. Likewise now, I know many kanji so I don't totally know many words but I can guess a lot more - more words helps japanese progress start feeling easier. So for languages that require more study hours, pushing to learn a lot of words quickly, and increase study time until milestones are happening as often as preferred, helped me with motivation.\n\nWhat I actually do for chinese and japanese. For chinese I like shows/webnovels so when I'm not motivated I just watch or read something in chinese I was planning to watch/read anyway in english. So when I'm not motivated to study, I'll watch a chinese show with dual subtitles, and try to not use the english subs except when I need to look up a word - or watch a show all in chinese if the english subs aren't out yet. Or I'll open a webnovel up and read it and look up words as I go, or a manhua if I'm lazy and want mostly pictures, or I'll put on an audiobook I like that I already know the plot of (from english) so I can comprehend a lot of it and just pick up some new words. I haven't felt motivated to study grammar, or active vocabulary, so I got on a language exchange app. I talk with someone, and once a week I've got to talk back in chinese - because of that alone I've practiced increasing active vocab and they let me know what grammar I need to fix. And its more fun just talking and having fun to me, then trying to do grammar drills right now.\n\nFor Japanese, now that comprehension is getting a bit easier, I've been playing one of my favorite video games in japanese to stay motivated. It's a game I know the story for, so its easy to guess words if I'm too lazy to look an unknown word up, the time played tells me how long I engaged with japanese so far, and I love the game so it feels fun. Lately, I've also been just trying to push through the sentences in Japanese Clozemaster, because I am doing a personal challenge to 'see if clozemaster works.' So I'm copying what someone else did - listening to sentences, then reading them/their translation and answering, and going through as many as I can. At the moment I plan to just do a month of Clozemaster nearly-daily and see how much progress I made because of it. I like to make little challenge goals to myself, so that if I don't know if a study method works or if I'll like it I try it and at least see. Lately I've also been just turning on japanese lets plays instead of english ones when I feel like watching one, and since I know more kanji now they're decently ok to follow. \n\nBasically I just try to do things I like to do, in that language. Or do something in the language while I'm doing something I regularly do - like audio files/flashcards or audiobooks when I drive/walk/clean etc. And when I am trying to study more intensely, making challenges for myself like 'read this book in 1 month' or 'try this new study method for a month' etc. \n\nWhat motivates me during the hard parts like before I knew enough to follow shows or read with a dictionary: consuming stuff I enjoyed in the language with subtitles in my native language. To remind me what I want to eventually be able to understand and do. That my end goals are to read X book, talk to X friend, watch X show as soon as it airs etc. And every so often trying to do those X things even though I'm bad at them, just to see the progress I'm making. \n\nIn month 5 I could barely follow 12 minutes of a cdrama and it drained me, at month 8 I could watch an episode in 1.5 hours with a dictionary and my brain fried but I could get through it, at month 10 I could watch a whole episode in 1 hour with some pausing for a dictionary, at month 14 I could watch a show without pausing and follow all the main ideas enough to keep up with a new show without english subs and many details if I rewatched. It gradually got more doable. A similar thing is happening with japanese at a slower pace. It motivates me to see how much better I got from where I started, how much I still want to improve to be able to do my goals as well as I want.", "created_utc": "1625861388.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4mn619", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oh23uy", "parent_id": "t3_oh23uy", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Le Petit Prince, although its probably a bit below B1.

These files I can comprehend everything being said, since I have the translation and time to figure out what it is in the target language. So they help me build up listening skill to things I do understand, and things I can easily pick up. Listening to audio flashcard style files is very active listening since if you pay attention you should be able to understand everything being said in the target language. \n\nA similar activity is to read a transcript for something short like a dialogue and make sure you understand everything, then listen while reading along to the transcript, then listen without the transcript and attempt to understand everything - and repeat until its easier to understand. Since if you use a transcript at first, you'll have comprehended everything, so afterward you're practicing listening to something you should eventually be able to listen-only to and understand.\n\nIn general, I've read in TheWordBrain.com that you need a couple thousand hours just for your mind to get used to parsing a new language - so I would guess based on that information, that yes listening to material you don't understand is still useful for building up an ability to parse and recognize the sounds of the language.

So some pronunciation foundation at least to clearly distinguish a language in your head I had to work on even just for my reading skills eventually (at least if I didn't want to get confused).\n\nBasically, I do think if you have certain specific goals you can definitely adjust your study plan! I think even if you just plan to read, or listen, or speak though, you'll need Some foundational skills in all areas though. So at the beginner stage learning a bit of listening, reading, speaking, writing basic skills helps to a degree no matter what the goal. And later on, once the primary goal is accomplished (like being able to read), you might realize you now are interested in speaking or listening. \n\nEven if initially I did not care if I learned to listen to chinese, knowing that pronunciation can relate to radicals in a hanzi can help me recognize hanzi easier when reading and learn new ones easier. It can also help me form a 'mental voice' when I read, which for me personally makes reading easier. I really struggle to read without a mental voice at first (which is what eventually became an issue for french when the mental voice was barely close to actual french).\n\nInitially I only wanted to learn to read Chinese too - but listening skills helped me remember hanzi and words in general much easier, which helped my reading skills, so listening ended up being very important as an extension of that. So I always had audio-text material when possible and it helped. Now that my reading is decent, I realize how much I enjoy chinese audiobooks and dramas and so my goals have shifted to wanting to improve my listening skills now so they're closer to my reading skills. Likewise, speaking wasn't a goal but I worked on tone production and accent a little so I'd have a decent mental voice. And now that I am chatting with people regularly, I'm glad I had that foundation and when reading is no longer a focus I'll probably work on it more consistently.\n\n I only needed 'a little' of the other skills practiced though, as far as improving in a specific goal is concerned. If you've got a specific goal to read, you don't need to speak to language partners or perfect your pronunciation or ever write. Any writing (maybe notes?) or pronunciation practice (maybe making sure you pronounce the letters roughly right instead of like your native language) or texting you do with others (maybe so you can read their writing) is just if it seems to be helping the main goal in some way. You might get other goals along the way.", "created_utc": "1625065474.0", "edited": "1625065779.0", "id": "h3kg21q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oafkzq", "parent_id": "t3_oafkzq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Their site says \"These timelines are based on what FSI has observed as the average length of time for a student to achieve proficiency, though the actual time can vary based on a number of factors, including the language learner\u2019s natural ability, prior linguistic experience, and time spent in the classroom.\" The FSI table itself says \"class\" hours so I'm guessing they're just counting class hours. \n\nI think in general FSI's suggested hours roughly matched how my progress went in the sense of French took 2 years to see huge amounts of progress with 1 hour of study a day (so 730 hours), my french production skills still need more hours of work (so maybe 200-400 more than FSI suggests) but my comprehension skills are good after their suggested time. And I self studied and had no idea what I was doing - with a good lesson plan and focused guidance 750 hours might have been enough for comfortable production skills too. So 750 hours didn't get me 'full fluency' in the full sense of production skills too, but it got me to a point where I was comfortable in the language, no longer need to study, can talk with people and if I just did it more would become better at it. \n\nWhereas japanese after 2 years I could barely read simple things at 1 hour of study a day (730 hours was just not as much progress for japanese since japanese takes more hours to hit milestones - FSI recommends 2200 class hours).

Kato Lomb's book How I Learned Languages gave me some ideas, stuff many random bloggers and people have written like Steven Krashen, Fluent Forever, people on the forum.language-learners.org forum etc. What's going to help you most is going to do with your goals and specific needs.

I dropped the language after 2.5 years (.5 doing immersion/srs flashcards), came back to it this March and immersion is helping a lot but I'm no where near outputting naturally. My understanding of input is no where near comfortable and easy enough yet for me to feel ready to output on much.\n\nChinese I am almost 2 years into, did a Refold-like approach since around 5 months into study. Only recently did I start working with a language exchange partner more and outputting a bit more. What I output comes to me so I have some active vocabulary and definitely some almost-active that was just waiting to need to be used, my grammar etc is understandable without issue when communicating (but has errors). I think at this point I could improve some grammar fine points more to kind of help prevent myself from ingraining bad habits, or work with a tutor soon for a similar reason. \n\nMy immersion is at a decent listening and good reading level of comprehension. I think for a number of people doing Refold they don't expect to output until input comprehension is pretty good. So its normal to wait 1-2 years+ to do output. According to the guide, I may be outputting a bit early for chinese and that might have its own struggles lol. \n\nI practiced outputting once with language exchange partners every several months to gauge where I was at and catch my 'ingrained' errors in understanding (like tone mispronunciation or word order making me incomprehensible), and so this is the first time I've been outputting and run into no issues with a language partner not understanding me or me not being able to communicate an idea so I've continued outputting for now. I think Refold does not recommend early output, I just did it personally sometimes.\n\nI'm curious what people do to improve their output skills once they get to the output stage, like with tutors or language partners or personal writing, beyond shadowing mentors and doing sentence mining.

Japanese is the hardest. I tried to learn several languages in high school and as an adult, never learned anything, japanese being one. I took a French class, tried a lot of study methods, finally figured out How I learned well. \n\nThen I took a fresh Japanese class and applied the same strategy - every single milestone took 4 times as long as the same milestones in French. It was super easy to get demotivated (even though Japanese taking longer was expected). It took over 2 years of study and changing my study methods up until I could finally barely struggle through very simple manga with a dictionary and just grasp the overall main idea. \n\nAt year 2, I started doing three things that helped 'speed up' my progress a lot: I did SRS flashcards (memrise Nukemarine's LLJ courses) which mainly helped because I studied a couple thousand words where before I'd only studied words in Genki or basic kanji (up to 500 only). So simply recognizing more words helped a ton (japanese requires one to know more words than french, since french I could rely on cognates to 'comprehend' things with much less study). I also changed my mindset to \"whatever I WILL do is good enough,\" so instead of trying to do things right I aimed to just DO things. I had held myself back for 2 years thinking I had to learn 2000 kanji the 'right' way before trying to read or learn vocab, but instead it just made me procrastinate and learn much slower than I apparently was capable of. So when I was using Memrise, if I could get a card right (since it tests you) I just kept going. If I could do it? Then I was doing good enough. The third thing I did was start immersing - I stopped acting like I had to \"be good enough\" before trying. I just started trying instead, assuming if I understood anything its better than nothing. Assuming if I did immerse, that was better than not trying to at all. And it helped a ton - I went from not managing manga at all to in a few months being able to get through chapters with a dictionary okay, and follow the gist main idea without a dictionary. I attempted to play video games I'd played in english before and learned I Could actually do it (though it was incredibly mentally draining lol). So that last 2 year - 2.5 years I made the most quick progress.\n\nThen I gave up. Because I realized japanese simply Does take longer than French - and my french after 2 years was where I wanted it and I didn't need to actively study it much, which made Japanese feel even slower and demotivating. I realized either Japanese was going to improve slow or I needed to put more time in if I wanted faster progress. I gave up studying it, since I was working 2 jobs and full time school and knew I had no consistent time to study.\n\nSchool ended, went down to one job, I ended up picking up Chinese for 1.5 years. That went really well - learned from my successes studying French and Japanese and the mistakes I'd made. Once my Chinese got to a point I could read and get the main idea of novels without a dictionary, I started slowly picking japanese back up. It's been 4 months now and it took 1 month to 'relearn' the old stuff, and now my japanese is making progress again and its been very exciting. The Chinese helped a lot in that kanji no longer feel nearly as daunting to me or like an obstacle I'll never overcome (I know a lot now by rough meaning, just sound and specific definition for specific words I have to learn now in japanese). \n\nI've learned even more about how I personally learn well, like adjusting to new grammar patterns, so I can apply that to japanese now. My japanese is now at a point where manga without a dictionary I can follow pretty well (and with a dictionary catch all details), easier novels I can read overall gist main idea without a dictionary (with a dictionary more clear main idea and some details), and brand new video games I can play entirely in japanese (though reading takes way longer its draining). My listening skills need a ton of work, as does learning specifics of vocab/pronunciation and really getting grammar patterns internalized. But just passively my comprehension skills after almost 3 cumulative years of japanese is where my French was after 1 year. \n\nThe biggest things that helped were generally: knowing in terms of time some languages just take longer to hit milestones (if I'd known ahead of time I could have dedicated more study hours to japanese per day - which is what I did for Chinese for faster progress), trying to DO things in the language ASAP (as in before I'm 'perfect' or 'good enough' - I start trying immediately now and often), and trying to learn a LOT of vocabulary and grammar and challenging myself (not slowing myself down on 'am I perfect enough' to move on - just moving on if I somewhat grasp something since I can always review later). So time and being more willing to challenge myself and less afraid of failure.

This can be done with actual paper flashcards, just reading/reviewing notes or your textbook at spaced-repetition intervals, or with srs flashcard apps like Anki and Memrise etc. It basically just helps you remember easier than reviewing at random times.\n\nI usually use it when I really want to efficiently learn to recognize certain things quickly - like learning the first 2000 common words in a language, or reading a grammar guide then re-looking at sections every several days. Then after I can recognize those things generally and am immersing (so I'm getting daily exposure to the words/concepts even without review), then I stop using stuff like srs flashcards on purpose because its ok if I forget some things I study more often at that point for me. \n\nMy results are usually: I get an initial recognition of things faster than when I study on my regular study schedule. So my regular study schedule was I did a semester in Genki, and reviewed chapter words a few times through each section - remembered words for my test but forgot the ones I didn't use during the next session since I didn't always remember to review what was getting rusty. Then I went to use srs app Memrise and studied 500 kanji, 500 words, and could get through studying a lot more words in a short amount of time (a month versus 3-4 months in a class), and tended to remember more of the words later. However - if you're using the language daily, and what you studied regularly, even without srs you will remember a lot (since you review it every time you run into it in the language) which is why I stop using srs when I'm done \"cramming\" a lot of info. Because once I know a certain amount, the speed of progress I make just studying then 'reviewing' as things come up in the language is fast enough that I'm ok with it.\n\nSpaced repetition is basically just an efficient review schedule to try and get things into your long term memory easier. If you review on a normal basis, you'll also remember things fine you just might spend more time reviewing or more time re-learning some things depending on how good you are at remembering things. If you're bad at reviewing, srs flashcard apps are nice because they have an automatic schedule and figure out the time to review info to help you remember it, so you just have to do your cards for the day and don't have to think about 'what did I see a day/week/month ago that I barely remember and want to review now?'\n\nAn example of a spaced repetition review schedule would be: Review in 1 day. Second repetition: 7 days. Third repetition: 16 days. Fourth repetition: 35 days.

Mainly I've been doing sentence flashcards like in anki or clozemaster to 'push up' what I'm able to read. \n\nWith chinese this issue was easier. I could find good graded readers that were chapters long and aimed at intermediate learners (500 hanzi, then 1500, then 2500) whereas with japanese I've mostly only seen super-beginner graded readers that were easier than manga, but not really anything between manga to light novels.

Maybe I need to go digging more for japanese novels...\n\nAlso not all kid novels are quite the same in terms of words. I read The Little Prince in French and Chinese, and the actual story is not predictable (which made it harder to read) but the words used were very common and generally relevant. Reading novels I've read before in English, I generally know ahead of time what words they'll have in them.

For other learning apps: people seem to like Lingodeer for Japanese (I find it about the same as duolingo just more grammar explanation), or using Anki or Memrise (see r/Refold for some anki deck resources, Memrise has Nukemarine's LLJ courses which I went through half of and liked as they included the core 2k common words and Tae Kim's grammar guide and kanji).", "created_utc": "1624632772.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h301v8l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7inhc", "parent_id": "t3_o7inhc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Dive in with both audio and subs in french.

Or you could focus on it the most first - since its already the language you know things in, you are starting closer to your goals and may get to them much faster. At least, you'll hit progress milestones much faster since you already know a lot.\n\nChinese: you can put it on hold until you have the time to dedicate to learning (since it may require the most consistent study in order to make and keep the progress you make, and you won't be able to take months off from studying it until you've learned a solid base). Or you can pick it to focus on first - because your in-laws speak it. Working on just getting to a conversational level is a lot, but its going to take less time then going from nothing to learning to read/write well. Especially if you don't care if you speak well, you only care that you can have understandable conversations (aka if you don't have to be perfect). If you just want to be conversational about household and family and hobby topics, that might require a lot less than learning how to write essays and read novels on top of the conversational skills. Chinese will still take a while, just because it takes a longer amount of time going from knowing nothing. But you have a very motivating reason to learn, that might be time sensitive - wanting to talk to people you know immediately. Time sensitive is very motivating.\n\nSo depending on your goals, doing Korean or Chinese first might be a good idea. Korean because you could probably make progress (and keep progress) the easiest since you already know a solid base amount. Chinese because you have people you immediately want to speak to. You could work on both at the same time too if you wanted - like mainly focus on Korean and just do X time for Chinese a day to get it started, then once your Korean goals are met just increase the time spent on Chinese. \n\nBut unless you have a lot of time to study, usually doing multiple languages at once means your time will be split between them and they'll both improve slower. That said, doing Korean while studying one of the other languages will probably be the most manageable, since you're less likely to lose much Korean you learn if you need to take week or month long breaks from studying Korean to focus on the other language more. Since you have a base already. However, if you have to take a week or month+ break from Chinese or Spanish starting out, you might end up having to re-study things more often. \n\nSpanish: if you find you want to speak spanish immediately with people in your life, more than you feel like doing so with Chinese - then maybe Spanish is priority instead. In which case focus on Spanish and/or Korean first, then Chinese last. Basically just: whatever you want to do Soonest, maybe prioritize the most. Whatever you don't care if it waits for a few years, prioritize last.\n\nYou could do all 3 if you really wanted - but if you don't have a lot of time to dedicate, generally that means you'll spend less time studying each language so each one will make slower progress. Also if you've never juggled studying multiple languages before, you may want to just try juggling 2 and see if that's even doable for you before trying 3. You want a study plan you can stick to, and see progress fast enough to be happy with. And this is just me personally - I did juggle 3 languages once and progress nearly-stalled in 2, slowed in all, and I could NOT do it unless the languages were all at different levels (absolute beginner, upper-beginner, lower-intermediate).

So it averages out to around 1-2 hours a day but its more like some days 30 minutes, other days 3 hours, sometimes none, sometimes several hours. I try to read most days though so usually I study at least 30 minutes (unless I get really into some other active activity like shadowing or flashcards that day).\n\nThis works for me because passive is easy to just 'do,' and usually any active study I can break into small 10-20 minute parts.

So part of it is just even somewhat comprehensible input is hard to find before you know a certain amount of common words.\n\nLanguage learner material is great at the very beginning stage - learner podcasts that use a lot of real common/basic words so you'll likely understand 50% really fast and relatively quickly most of it since it will aim to teach you the rest of the words, youtube conversational videos made for learners, searching \"comprehensible input\" X-language in youtube and checking out those channels made to be very comprehensible to watch and understand from context (like \"Learn Korean in Korean\" channel is), graded reader books, sentence srs flashcards (especially if they start with very basic stuff so it progressively gets less basic as you learn more and stays fairly comprehensible). Stuff like Assimil and Teach Yourself and Pimsleur.\n\nFor chinese I couldn't understand anything but maybe a single phrase or super common word here or there until 5+ months in, and couldn't actually comprehend the main idea of what was happening until 8+ months in (with a lot of mental effort and a dictionary and pausing a lot at first - it got better over time). It felt very draining months 5-8 trying to watch things and follow anything, I did it in small 10 minute bursts and could barely follow things at first.\n\nOnce things do get slightly bearable to manage to follow some main ideas and look key words up, content that's easier to comprehend will feel less draining. So stuff like: things you watched before in a native language or with native language subtitles, cartoons for kids that repeat things/point things out, stuff in settings with words you're more familiar with (so if you know school words then stories set in schools etc), reading show episode summaries before you watch, watching something in your native language or native language subs first, picking stuff that's just written simpler, picking stuff with action (I liked shows with heavy action or murder mysteries at first since I could visually see the swords they'd mention or the body or the office and could figure out more from context visually). Reading or watching things related to stuff you already have context for - so if you watched an anime with english subs, reading the manga in your target language, or if you read a book in english then watching the movie in your target language.\n\nFor listening: I read in [The Word Brain](http://www.thewordbrain.com/) that a person needs roughly 2000 hours of listening input to parse sounds in a language, so just listening more and often in general at such an early stage is generally going to help your listening skills later.

But the main part that I think has been helping is just - listening to audiobooks while I read along with the text, then listening to those audiobook chapters again a few times without the text (to pick up more and more since I know all the context from reading with the audio beforehand). Around 10 chapters in I started noticing overall listening skill improvements. \n\nAlso some apps (I believe Language Learning with Netflix chrome extension can do this, I used Viki learn mode) you can put on different subtitle options and replay audio clips with scenes over and over. I did this a handful of hours this month and its also made a noticeable difference. Listening until I can follow with the target language subtitles clearly and hear each word, then not looking and listening a few more times to a line until I can follow it fully without the subtitles. (Edit: also, just watching show episodes a few times without subtitles, you'll pick up more each time, but I don't like watching full episodes repeatedly much).\n\nYou could do similar exercises with short stories with audio, podcasts with transcripts, youtube videos with the transcript open. You just listen with the text, making out the words in the audio, then listen without looking at the text reference several times until you can hear everything fine. Its easier to do small minutes of chunks when you feel like practicing, at least for me, rather than bigger 30 minute or hour long sessions.\n\nI also find audio flashcards help with this. For me, that means audio files that say a sentence in my native language, then in my target language 1-2 times. So that I practice understanding the full sentence. I have audio files of ~30 minutes and just sort of listen to those in the background walking or working and they've helped. Also clozemaster app now has a 'radio' option in the paid version, which depending on the language may be useful - its basically automatic audio flashcard sentences where you can set how many times sentences repeat etc. Regular flashcards in audio format (like in anki etc) should also work fine if you replay the audio enough to make sure you've understood it fully before moving on to the next card. \n\nI'm still working on improving my listening skills, my reading skills were higher.

Depending on how you like to learn, you might be able to find a language partner and just do most learning by talking with someone. The main thing however you study is time put in. Chinese takes a lot of time to see improvements generally, so the more hours you can put in per day/week the faster you'll get to conversational. \n\nI study around 2 hours on average a day, and its been almost 2 years that I'm now just starting to feel basically conversational about my hobbies/random topics. I prioritized reading/listening first, so my active vocabulary being weak is probably part of why conversational is developing slower. But even reading and listening didn't really get to a level where I could relax and do it without a dictionary (versus just bear it without a dictionary) until maybe 1.5 years into studying. I did start having real basic 'Hi I'm x, what do you like, what's up, etc' at 5-8 months though so talking about basic stuff especially with a dictionary will be something you can start trying.

So most words I now learn by reading novels and looking up words until they stick, or reading/hearing them in context in shows or chatting.\n\nYou said you used sentences - those do seem more helpful, from flashcards I've tried. But single-word flashcards got the job done too, if they're all you have (and are seeing some explanation of grammar somewhere like in a guide or immersion). I think the biggest benefit to flashcards is audio if you can have it, especially audio and written. I've noticed huge differences between when I've studied with audio including decks versus just text - audio including ones helped me get a much better sense of pronunciation and recognition of words when listening, and chances to practice listening when I'm studying new words. \n\nFor text-only cards I had to do more practice with words later (like I've had to add audiobooks to my reading practice since so many reading-only words I pick up I can't recognize as fast when listening). Right now, I rarely use flashcards but I do use \"audio flashcards\" like what japaneseaudiolessons.com has, or Chinese Spoonfed audio. But a persons listening versus reading strength will probably determine how valuable needing audio on flashcards is - even flashcards without audio have 'worked' ok for me, it just meant I had to do more work elsewhere.\n\nI think whatever study plan you will DO is the best thing to do. So if you know you give up and get bored when you make your own flashcards, you don't have to do if if it will make you give up studying. Anything to keep you studying is better than giving up, so if other study methods keep you studying then its okay to switch to them. If 'premade' cards are less good but you will DO them, then they're good enough. If you have a 'lazier' way to make flashcards but you enjoy making them that way more? Then its good enough. If you hate flashcards all together, then doing something else is better than not studying at all, whatever you do is good enough if it keeps you studying. \n\nFor me, I know I give up flashcards regularly after bursts of 1-2 weeks. So I usually just use them when I need to cram-study some info that's challenging me, then reinforce things with actually seeing that stuff in context in immersion (and if I don't see it enough to reinforce it then I'll learn it later, since mostly I'm cramming so I can understand my immersion content better). Since I'm most motivated by learning in context, that's what I mostly do - read, watch, and try to use study plans that are actively part of doing that (so graded readers as a beginner, comprehensible input lesson youtube videos and books like Le Francais Par Le Methode Nature as a beginner, learner podcasts, show watching tools I can click for definitions, reader tools with click definitions). \n\nI know when I use flashcards a lot, I just get burned out and sometimes give up and don't study at all. So I only use flashcards when I know I'll be able to focus, and have a plan to study without them when I can't do them anymore. I use premade usually because I know from past experience I always give up when I make my own, and get demotivated and bored making them. I do like saving word lists or sentences when its convenient just to glance at and review when I feel like though - like my Reader app allows me to do with a click. \n\nI know for me personally, if I spend too much time making my study material instead of just Using it/working with the language, I get bored and give up.

While for some people it might be 600 hours versus 1000, that still comes down to being able to put in the effort to keep studying that long.\n\nBetter study methods if they help the person, might speed up how long it takes to learn certain things (some people like srs flashcards because they're a pretty time-efficient way to remember stuff etc), or slow down progress (like relearning basic material instead of moving forward into progressively more challenging classes/materials etc), but its still going to be hundreds of hours of time investment to get to certain milestones of understanding and using a new language. Now slowing-down progress situations can be demotivating, because even if you're putting in tons of hours of effort it can make you feel there's no progress on the horizon, but if the effort remains then eventually people do realize other study plans that work better for them/finally find more challenging material, notice what's not working for them and adjust etc. Or not being as 'naturally good' at picking things up might mean its more annoying to re-study things you struggle to pick up because they do need to be learned, since that's less motivating then seeing new milestones reached - but ultimately you still reach goals. When I'm jealous of people with natural talent lol, in the end its just because maybe they don't have to do sound drills or grammar exercises or look up words over and over as much as me, since they remember faster. But the rest I can control, and learning everything is still doable for me it will just mean a little bit different progress rate.\n\nTalent probably makes the ride a little smoother - talent of memorizing easily, picking up sounds easy, remembering patterns easy. Maybe luckily picking a good study plan for you on the first try or just being good at making study plans (which probably took prior effort at some point in life). And maybe talent shaves off a % of hours you'll need to hit milestones. But its still going to be a ton of hours of study.", "created_utc": "1624293927.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2jy3e3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o3phpc", "parent_id": "t3_o3phpc", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for this response.

Some days I do 30-40 minutes, some I do 3-4 hours. Usually I do at least 30 minutes a day because I like to at least watch one ep of a show in my target language a day, or read at least 1 chapter, or listen to at least 1 audiobook chapter. \n\nI am not sure what 'passive' study would be, but once I got past the beginner stage a bit, I spent a lot more time listening to audiobooks of things I'd already read, or audio flashcards (so english sentence then chinese), in the background as I exercised or worked. Or watching shows in only chinese without bothering to look up words (whereas sometimes I 'actively' study by looking up any key unknown words or replaying scenes to catch all words better). So now my passive study is usually 30 minutes a day to 2 hours (more when I'm just playing some audio in the background as I work/do things). \n\nI've noticed passive study helps me review what I know, get better at recognizing it faster, and if its something very comprehensible like audio flashcards or audiobooks I already read, then I can usually learn some new words here and there. So I think its worth doing some 'lower effort' study if its mostly-comprehensible to you. For me, its been really helping my listening skills catch up to my reading skills. Active study can burn me out easy. So some weeks I manage 2-3 hours like you said, then barely do it. But it's a faster way to cram through 100 words a week, or read up grammar points, etc, which makes reading/watching active study easier later.\n\nFor french stuff: I like [Language Transfer French](https://www.languagetransfer.org/french), while Coffee Break French is nice its more repeat-after-me whereas LT is more like the logic of a language. \n\nI like [Le Francais par le Methode Nature](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf8XN5kNFkhdIS7NMcdUdxibD1UyzNFTP) - if you like learning in context by doing its great although old. Everything is taught in french, from simple and easy to figure out from context, to progressively more difficult graded reading that continues to be comprehensible with its surrounding context. So learning French entirely in French. The youtube channel I linked is doing audio for every chapter. \n\nI liked reading [The Word Brain](http://www.thewordbrain.com/) regarding language learning, and they link to [GigaFrench](http://gigafrench.com/) which I imagine might be nice. I haven't checked it out yet but the related Italian book I've heard super good things about. \n\nAlso once your french gets to a certain level? I find there's a ton of French dubbed shows, if you want to watch something you already know the plot of in french so its easier to comprehend/figure out the words (Merlin saison 1, Buffy contre les vampires saison 1, etc) if you search with 'saison 1' etc in google with the french title, the shows often are easy to find. There's probably also some good french shows on Netflix if you try some out and see which ones you like. Also if you're into fanfiction, there's a ton of french fanfiction out there on sites like archiveofourown.com, fanfiction.net etc. On youtube, if you search game titles and 'jouons' you can find lets plays. If you want to play video games in french, depending on where you live some games have french options (in the US a lot of games have french language options for audio/subtitles), and in Steam a ton of games have french language options.

I bought a good grammar guide summary book with 2k common words in it and started reading through it, listened to a Russian learning podcast to practice speaking, learned the Cyrillic alphabet in a week, read/wrote 1000 common words list early on, texted and spoke to my partner in russian.

What its good for: dictionary for single words/chengyu, reading, srs flashcards. \n\nThe thing I find it most irreplacable for is the dictionary - its the best and most convienient I've found so far for when reading. It also dictates words/passages aloud so I have audio and pinyin and definitions and example sentences etc for anything. I bought a like $10 dictionary add on so it would have even more words/chengyu/natural voices because its the best app for me for word lookup (I use deepl.com, Baidu Translate, Google translate, for full sentences when I get confused). Pleco's the best dictionary app I found for single word/set phrase look up. \n\nIts Reader tool is my favorite part (the free version is \"Clipboard Reader\" where you copy paste, the Reader tool you pay a one time cost of like $10 for includes pdf/txt/doc etc import and a web browser etc to bookmark anything). Its my favorite reader tool for any language, especially with the very good word definitions and audio dictation for words and entire passages. It also has cheap graded readers you can purchase on the app that go through a lot of levels (I used a few they were great, now I mainly read webnovels). There are some alternatives that work almost as well but less convienient to me: Mandarinspot.com Text Annotator (has good limited definitions and no audio, can be used on mobile though), Zhongwen chrome extension (good limited definitions and no audio and must be used on chrome), iPhone word \"Look Up\" if you click a word (good definitions, no audio, no OCR like Pleco), Idiom and LingQ (awful definitions compared to Pleco or the other mentioned Reader tools, and LingQ is expensive whereas Pleco is free or one time costs for add ons). I use Pleco reader tool daily, its just so convienent to bookmark webnovels I'm reading and read them in there, with audio for any new hanzi and definitions for anything unknown. I'm on my phone way more than my computer - but for someone often on a computer or tablet, other reader tools (like Zhongwen extension etc) might suit a person better.\n\nSRS Flashcards tool - anki and memrise are obviously alternatives. Pleco's built in flashcard area is nice though because sentence mining from example sentences in the dictionary entries or in the Clipboard Reader/Reader tools is as easy as highlighting a sentence. Pleco can generate pinyin, audio, and definitions (if its a word/phrase) or allow you to type your own definition (for sentences). This can all be done on the phone with a click so it doesn't require getting onto the computer like anki does (I think anki app lets you do this on the phone too it just didn't work for my phone unfortunately). Like anki etc, user communities also have already made a lot of premade Pleco card decks to use for free (I use some sentence mining ones, common chengyu ones, hanzi ones). So if you like flashcards or sentence mining, its easy to do that. I usually just save words/sentences to read the flashcard lists of and review later, but it also has full SRS review schedules.\n\nYou don't need it, and its not a 'follow this lesson plan' app the way something like HackChinese or Skritter is. It's mainly a really good dictionary app with a lot of nice add ons. As a dictionary app I'd say try it out - its free, and has really good definitions. As far as daily use, I use it constantly as a reading tool because the combo of great definitions and audio I just really appreciate.

First here's a [video](https://youtu.be/Bue05mPPoFw) of a guy who studied French 8 hours a day for a month. I'd like to try a smaller version of his study methods though, because they look really helpful for production skills and its what I want to work on more. It seems like an overall good study plan if you have the time.\n\nWhat I would do for japanese personally? The same thing I'm doing now, just have more time for it. \n\nSince you have 6 hours: make your usual study goals. You can either make more study goals per month since you have more time, or just dedicate more time to them since you have more time (so those goals get done in less days). If you tend to get distracted when trying to learn many things at once then maybe stick to the same amount of goals as usual, so they get done in less days - then you can move onto new goals once they're solid.\n\nSo example: for 2 weeks you want to work on reading. You pick a novel to read (or graded reader) and try to finish it in 2 weeks. With 6 hours a day you may get through a few books depending on their length. At the end of 2 weeks your reading skill has improved. Next 2 weeks you want to work on speaking. You decide to do shadowing to practice speaking, and get on a language exchange app every day and challenge yourself to have conversations for an hour each day (looking up any unknown words, asking for corrections etc) - or some other writing/speaking practice exercise (like journaling, exercises in the video I linked above, doing Genki grammar writing exercises etc). You might work on each goal for a week, or 2, or a month - and you might choose more than one goal per time period if you can handle it. \n\nI probably couldn't study 6 hours straight - I'd need 10-30 minute breaks every so often. And also, I'd probably want some of my time (probably half) to be 'easier' study. So for you Listening/Reading are easier. So I'd probably make half my study time audio books, audiodramas, shows, videos, video games, reading in only japanese, and then the other half of my study time my specific goal for the time period. If my main goal was speaking during a time period then I'd try to also spend my 'easier' time on shows/audio so I could shadow every so often and get 'more speaking exercises' into my day. If my main goal was writing for a time period, maybe I'd try to write a summary of what I watched/read etc during the 'easier' part of my study. That way, half my time I could just relax mostly and do stuff I was going to do anyway like play videogames or watch anime - just in japanese. Your break time could be those things in english/with english subs (or just doing whatever you want). And if you are a fan of anki/srs flashcards, then doing some review using that per day would be helpful. \n\nOr, I would try out random study methods I've wanted to try since 6 hours would give me TIME to. So if you ever wanted to test if you liked certain study methods, if they'd work for you, now would be a good time - since you'd see progress in a shorter amount of days. Whereas if you only have 1-2 hours of study a day, it could take months to see if a study method works better for you or not. I'd probably try Listening Reading Method because I want a good chunk of 30 hours straight some week to try it better. Or I'd try [Wasabi Japanese's Read Aloud](https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-lessons/japanese-lessons-how-to-proceed-with-read-aloud-method) method because I enjoy it but haven't had time. Or I'd read through a full novel, or play through a full video game - and see how much improvement I get.

But that means setting boundaries. If he leaves because he isn't willing to respect your boundaries? Then he doesn't want to change the codependency. And if you're gonna be in love, be happier and healthier together in a relationship, then you sound like you want your relationships to be less codependent. So if he doesn't want it to stop being codependent? Then he isn't in the relationship. If he loves you, he'll be willing to respect your boundaries. Or to break up, grow on his own, and come back if and when he is ready to respect your boundaries, and then its your choice if being with him at that time is what you want. \n\nIt's like friendship. If you had a friend who cancelled plans, asked you to pay for everything, asked to live at your house for free, would you ask your friend to please be more fair?

Would you maybe choose not to be their friend anymore, even if they did change, because its up to you if you're willing to take the risk again and handle the stress of setting boundaries again if they try to push yours again. \n\nIf you wouldn't want a friend to treat you like this, then someone who's supposed to love you should NOT treat you like this - or else its not really love. A good friend? If they were told you wanted things to be more fair, they might not realize they were doing stuff that wasn't wanted, and once told they'd work on being more fair - and you'd decide if they were doing enough to merit still talking to them (or if they just ended up steamrolling your boundaries). \n\nIf you don't tell someone - yeah, they might not know your boundaries.

If you set boundaries, tell someone them, and that person keeps pushing them? They do not actually care about you. \n\nEven though you love this guy, you can love him and not be with him. If he doesn't treat you fairly and respect your boundaries, then he doesn't need to interact with you and hurt you. You can want good things for him, and not him to hurt you. So you set boundaries. If he doesn't respect them, leave. Its up to him if he cares about you enough to make it work out. Its not up to you. Let him do what he wants once he's set your boundaries, and mean what you say. If he breaks your boundaries leave. If he starts respecting them, its up to you if the relationship is improved enough to be a positive in your life. \n\nBut someone who doesn't respect your boundaries, does not care about you. Its not love. If you want love, then as long as he's not respecting you, he's not loving you. Even if he says the word love, or acts romantic. If he doesn't know your boundaries - let him know. Then its up to him to show with actions if he cares or not. And if he doesn't care, then you'll know.\n\nI loved a girl once. She said she loved me for years, acted 'loving' took me on dates and got me gifts and we were mostly 'good.' She also said I couldn't see my friends, could only go to her house, had to do dates she said only. She said I couldn't talk to her if I was sad. She said if she yelled it was always my responsibility to fix it or she'd stop talking to me. As you can tell - that's not love. She wanted me to do whatever she said, or she'd leave me. \n\nWhen I finally realized hey: if she lies, then I want to choose to not see her until I'm sure she's telling the truth about what she promises to me. Hey, if I want to see my friends, then I might pick to see them. Hey, if I want to not go where she says, and she doesn't want to go where I want, then we can just not hang out. She didn't end up telling the truth, she yelled a lot at me setting boundaries. And I found out, she didn't care about respecting me, didn't care about me. It didn't matter how she affected my life, she just wanted me to do whatever I was told and drop anything for her at any time. \n\nNo matter how much she'd said she loved me - that wasn't love. I loved her and wanted to marry her, be with her forever. But when I set boundaries, she showed she didn't care about me enough to treat me fairly. So we broke up, and even then she treated me rudely and lied when we interacted. So I realized I could love her and hope she's well, but she's not good for me in my life. And if she can't treat me equally as a person, then my life is not good with her in it. I'm better off alone, then with her. Because with her I was never loved back anyway - it wasn't actual love or care. I was just together with someone who hurt me. At least single, I don't cling to a hope someday it'll be real love. It's not real love, unless they can treat you fair. And I saw that she couldn't. \n  \nOn a lighter note, I did casual dating for a couple years. Learned people will keep dating you if you set boundaries - nice people. Learned people who aren't nice usually leave if you set boundaries early (great), or start respecting them if they do care about you (and its up to you if they're worth still seeing since you aren't in love yet). and whoever you meet who does respect your boundaries - they have the potential to be friends who love you, actually love you. And eventually meeting a lover who does treat you with care and love.\n\ntldr: You can leave someone if you love them, if they don't treat you with real care and respect. You deserve people in your life who respect your boundaries - and if they love you back, they'll respect them. If they don't? You can hope well for them and that they'll have a life where they do care enough to respect others, and you can build your life where the people in it respect and care about you. If they grow, and come back, its up to you if you feel they respect you and can be trusted to be fair to you then. If they actually love you and its not just words, that will eventually happen. If they don't really, then it wasn't love even when you were in a relationship and it wasn't going to be.", "created_utc": "1623351807.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h1bbx6q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nwquyb", "parent_id": "t3_nwquyb", "score": "9", "subreddit": "Codependency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblj"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Nope.

Sometimes I still do if I'm feeling stressed, I feel like if I'm not \"fixing things\" then I imminently deserve to die. Which is not true but I sure do believe it in the moment. So part of what helps is just, trying to not get that stressed when I can manage to. I wrote a bunch of affirmations and self-soothing things to do if I get like that, try to warn my roommate if I'm feeling like that, and he usually reminds me the best thing I can do is just eat, drink water, curl up comfy and not try to 'do everything' until I'm calmer. Since usually nothing is enough, and I'll have a panic attack and feel worthless anyway, and 'fixing things' is super hard when you're having a panic attack so it just gets worse agh.\n\nWhen I was younger I kind of had to stop. I overworked so much I went from 'recovering' right back to suicidal with multiple panic attacks a day and constant stomach pain. I overworked so much that even when I quit my second job, finished school, and had a normal amount of 'work' per day I had so much stomach pain that eating anything hurt. I had to have 2 years of doctors, painful eating, a surgery, and now its only half fixed so often I still have to think about what I eat and am in pain. My doctors think a big part of what caused it is stress. So I know now, not only do I get worse panic attacks and get suicidal if I constantly do things, but my body tries to break. Not eating sucks, I'm happy to just be able to eat sometimes without pain, and I really don't want all food to hurt again. So that really motivated me to stop overworking and when I get the tendency to \"feel I always need to do stuff\" to remind myself I might get really sick again unless I make sure I only do a healthy amount of work. No more over 40 hours a week unless its real short term and I realize I'm probably going to mess up my health. More taking off sick if I'm truly sick. More breaks if I'm having panic attacks, so I don't make them worse. If I'm having them, realizing I might be doing something not good for me (a job I need to leave, seeing my parents too often, making myself work too much). \n\nI don't know, I suppose I didn't figure things out the easy way. I didn't learn to be 'kinder' to myself at all until the consequence was being suicidal or constantly physically not being able to even eat lol. I wish I'd learned to do 'nothing' more often sooner cause I didn't like learning that way.\n\nSeveral years back I tried having more hobbies where success/perfection was not the main goal. That's not 'doing nothing' but it helped me get more tolerant of doing 'low productive' things, and eventually just giving myself more relaxing/take care of self time. Hobbies like drawing with markers on printer paper so there's not a big intent to 'look nice,' reading books where its just pages read but no good/bad way to do it, studying languages myself so no rubric or strict assignments just me reading some stuff then trying out shows, books, chatting eventually, going at my own pace. Dancing at home where I don't have to look up moves and just move and its good cause I wanted to do it but there's no did well/bad. Hiking or walking around town. Playing with dogs. Writing stuff that's just for me. Stuff I can't do well/bad in since doing it for me is what made it 'good.' So I have more times I'm not thinking about productive or wasting time. It just got me more used to not feeling guilty for 'not productive' time as constantly.\n\nAlso might be dumb but: having a planner (or digital calendar) when life is busy. I'd block out hours I planned to do stuff I have to - so I 'know' it'll be done and by when and I 'planned' plenty of time. And anything not blocked off is my free time (and I make sure only to have so many things blocked off per day cause otherwise I overwork). So like my work calendar right now can have stuff between 7 am - 4, after that nope the time is 'over' so I might schedule more I need done another day but not that day. When I see my calendar is 'super full' i try to spread out when things are done to give myself more breaks. At home we do most chores one day, so we know mostly our time won't be overwhelmed with them at random. I don't get specific about time each thing is done (Someone else could be). But just knowing \"ok 4 hours to fix my car tomorrow\" and then I don't feel guilty/horrible when I wake up and have breakfast first and calm down since I'll spend 4 hours on it at some point today, or when if it needs more work I try to tell myself 'not today' and schedule the other work for the next day.", "created_utc": "1623337387.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h1acpzl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nwm0bb", "parent_id": "t3_nwm0bb", "score": "10", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vvid"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'd love to hear people answer this. In a way, I'd love to see a ghost - because to me it would be slightly more 'proof' maybe there's something post death. I mean a 'ghost' could also just be someone alive in a parallel dimension, or an illusion, so it wouldn't prove an afterlife - but it would be more than I have now. If someone else sees a ghost, I can't really be sure they didn't just imagine it. So I'd like to see one myself and form my own opinion.\n\nI think, the only thought I have on it is this. Everything that exists, changes form, but isn't destroyed. Energy changes, doesn't disappear and magically appear from nothing. Rocks change to lava and eventually back to rock. Water changes to vapor and ice and eventually water again. Things don't ever 'cease,' they just change. So life coming from absolutely nothing? Makes very little sense to me. Life suddenly ending, instead of changing, makes very little sense to me. I don't understand how life could 'miraculously appear from nothing' then 'cease to exist,' when other things in the world do not work that way. So to me, it makes more sense life came from something before, and will change to some other form later. That may not be an afterlife of course. I have no idea what it could be. But simply 'ceasing and disappearing' is so different than physical material in this world, it seems strange to me if life works that way. I could be wrong though - maybe life does simply appear from nowhere/nothing then cease to exist completely. It would be odd but maybe. \n\nSo I'm not someone who could convince you. I just think for me, it makes more logical sense that life simply becomes something else, rather than appearing from nothing and then completely being destroyed. When rocks, water, energy all change form but don't disappear. So I think some kind of post-death change makes sense.

So if you want 6 months of progress in a month, then up your study hours from 1 hour a day to 6 hours. No matter how good a study plan, part of language learning is just 'hours put in.' The people I've seen make youtube videos of [learning Italian 'in a month'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MBPPg1xAsA) or [French 'in a month'](https://youtu.be/Bue05mPPoFw) were putting 8 hours a day generally into studying, or more. And their goal was maybe A2 level (I'm not sure), but a goal to be able to move into learning more from native podcasts/books/conversations with speakers after all their intensive study that month. \n\nEven Listening Reading Method, which I find really fun, was done by the original maker 8 hours a day for a month to a few months to get to a language level to listen naturally to stuff a bit easier than the books they study from, and communicate with people - so that's 200+ hours a month. I've seen someone do an [experiment with L-R](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1721&p=99415#p99415) where they went from A1 to B1 in a month, in listening/reading skills only, but they had prior romance language knowledge and were learning another romance language (and their plan still required a lot of dedicated time that month of the experiement).\n\nSo if you want A2, B1 etc in a language - look up how much hours its estimated to take for your target language. Then divide that by how many days you want to study. That will be around the amount of hours you'll want to study per day.\n\nI do think setting a goal to do something specific is much easier to achieve in a short time. Like setting a goal: to introduce myself, be able to talk at a basic level about 'I do x hobbies, y work, I like z things, how are you' and be able to know some basic answers people might say. That kind of goal is often semester 1 class goals in school, and just upping study hours could probably get that done in a shorter amount of time. \n\nOr I've seen a short term month goal of \"be able to [understand the overall gist of a tv show](https://learnlangs.com/understand-your-favourite-tv-series-in-30-days/) in the language in a month.\" The person sentence mined the show, studied in anki, read a grammar guide, watched the show regularly, and within a month was able to start following the overall plot without english translations. They proved that very specific goal was doable in a month. I've seen people learn 2000 kanji in 3 months, as short term big goals. I am intermediate when I did this for something, but I used Listening Reading Method for a short term goal of improving my listening comprehension enough to follow a specific audiobook without text or translation eventually, and its working well. Short term goals are definitely something you could focus in on and 'speedrun.' \n\nEven if your goal is A2 in a month, or B2 in 3 months (etc). Having specific short term goals like \"this week read a grammar guide, learn X common vocab next 2 weeks, start graded reader at the end of month 1, have casual conversation about my family at end of month 1\" etc can help stay focused and moving forward. So even if you don't get where you planned, you've made a lot of progress that matters to you. I think you're right that it will be fun to see what happens! I know I personally get really motivated when I see what someone else did - I want to challenge myself to \"try it\" and prove if it works or doesn't lol. So if I saw someone else doing a speedrun I'd want to copy what they did and see if it works the same lol - which is how I got into Listening Reading method. Even if it doesn't work, you learn what does/doesn't for you, and probably make progress!\n\nIf your goal really is broad \"x level in a language\" in a short time frame, you might want to dig into what other people have done. To get an idea of how to make a study routine to get what you want to learn covered within the time you have. I linked a few above that might be relevant depending on your goals.

The Monarch Industry, The Story of Yanxi Palace, Empresses in The Palace, all also look pretty good. \n\nComedy: [Go princess go](https://mydramalist.com/16159-go-princess-go) (I only watched half of this, its super low budget but it was funny), [Romance of Tiger and Rose](https://mydramalist.com/38907-the-third-princess-from-the-rumors) (this one is incredibly funny especially if you've seen some other Costume Dramas since it makes fun of them). \n\nThriller/Suspense: [The Bad Kids](https://mydramalist.com/51571-cat-s-cradle) (short, well liked), [The Long Night](https://mydramalist.com/49485-the-long-night), [A Murderous Affair in Horizon Tower](https://mydramalist.com/37243-a-murderous-affair-in-horizon-tower).\n\nSome personal favorites (but the genres vary a lot): [Go Ahead](https://mydramalist.com/40911-go-ahead) (a really well written modern drama), [Guardian](https://mydramalist.com/26035-guardian) (super low budget like 90s tv, first cdrama I saw, a ton like Buffy, X Files, Xmen, Torchwood so I loved it), [Detective L](https://mydramalist.com/30757-detective-l) (Very similar to Sherlock Holmes so if you like that, this will feel familiar), [My Roommate is a Detective](https://mydramalist.com/34129-my-roommate-is-a-detective) (a nice intro to Republican era genre, detective crime show), [Love and Redemption](https://mydramalist.com/39661-love-and-redemption)  (If I had to pick a romance xianxia this is by far my favorite, Love and Destiny is also really solid for this genre),  [Rattan](https://mydramalist.com/48685-si-teng) (refreshing, a balance of multiple genres and visually beautiful),[The King's Avatar](https://mydramalist.com/24018-the-kings-avatar) (if I had to pick a sports genre, this is well loved, and its got a very popular donghua and huge webnovel and audiobooks so if you end up liking it you will have tons of material), [Hikaru No Go](https://mydramalist.com/45437-qi-hun) (if you liked the anime this drama is amazing, this is one of the best drama adaptations I've ever seen and one of the best cdramas period I've ever seen, it was so good it made me want to check out the anime and manga).  \n\nWuxia (not sure if some are xianxia as this is MDL tags): [Ever Night](https://mydramalist.com/27178-ever-night\"), [Word of Honor](https://mydramalist.com/59021-tian-ya-ke), [Joy of Life](https://mydramalist.com/28674-joy-of-life) (well liked, political time travel, based on a huge novel).\n\nedit: fixing my links, sorry.", "created_utc": "1622950943.0", "edited": "1622951601.0", "id": "h0rcbq2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nt51s1", "parent_id": "t3_nt51s1", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "It's cool hearing about your reading approach.

I think if you market well (having a youtube channel, a blog where you discuss its features and real people using the app's progress, discuss how it helps on forums). Steve Kaufman and Robin MacPherson come to mind as 2 who bring up their apps while also being just watchable language learning youtubes, Matt Vs Japan discussed MIA/Refold using youtube and its site/forums/discords well. \n\nDiscussing your app in general more is what will help it be seen, along with having an app model that is likable by its userbase. Duolingo is free with ads which is the easiest for people to use, memrise is free to use and has some perks with paid subsciption, clozemaster is the same, Pleco is my favorite chinese app and its free for the base and 'one time purchase' for any other features so users don't have to manage subscriptions, LingQ is paid which is why I never use it but its marketed often enough it still has a userbase etc.\n\nI would really like more language learning apps focused on: intermediate materials, intermediate vocab and grammar* for CEFR B1-B2, for Japanese JLPT N3-N1, Chinese HSK 4-HSK6. So many apps only cover beginner material, having any intermediate material immediately makes an app stand out and become useful to people who have few apps to use at that stage. Particularly if there's also grammar explanations (because so few apps include grammar), and if there's practice. Reader apps like LingQ, Pleco, Beelinguis, all stand out to me because beginners and intermediate users can use them to practice reading and listening to materials, Lingodeer mostly only has beginner materials but its helpful grammar explanations make it stand out (especially for things like Japanese where grammar explanations help a lot). Clozemaster stands out because it covers thousands of words into intermediate-level, and its use of sentences to learn mean users are getting some reading practice constantly (I've used Clozemaster to transition from beginner material into native material, and some people may use sentence-card decks in Anki for similar reasons). \n\nRelated to 'harder to find apps' a very grammar focused app (like having grammar guides from beginner to intermediate or advanced for languages) might be useful since I rarely see those. I think there's Bunpro for japanese (which is one of the few japanese apps going beyond beginner, and helps fill in the gap as people learn vocab with other apps but very little grammar). \n\nThere's also a huge lack of Shadowing apps - apps where users can hear an example, speak and have their attempt recorded, then hear the two compared so they can improve their listening and accent. I had to dig into apps in the Chinese language to find a really good Shadowing app (that one even grades based on what was pronounced wrong and by how much, but even simpler apps would be useful). I've never seen a shadowing app for other languages. Its an activity that's useful but requires recording oneself and comparing audio with the example, and an app definitely makes it a more convenient process.\n\nSummary: I think whatever you build, if its useful to someone then its good it exists! We can always use more tools since they're all suited to different people in different ways! If you're worried about usage, market it and find ways to spread info on it. If you want to meet a need in the language app market - dig into what's missing. I personally think there's a huge lack of intermediate-material apps, with the only options being user-made flashcards at that point (anki, memrise, usually just vocab or sentences and little grammar), or starting to immerse (apps with Reader tools like LingQ, Pleco). But there's not many apps with organized material at that level so a person can just keep following a lesson plan. And apps with grammar notes (Lingodeer helps a lot just because of this feature), and Shadowing apps, are not very common but would be useful.", "created_utc": "1622816778.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0kk4te", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nrsiqw", "parent_id": "t3_nrsiqw", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Its hard figuring out this stuff on our own lol ToT At first, I had the opposite problem - I didn't know how to open up even a little.

If a friend asks how I'm doing, I might say some, more if they're open to talking. Same with them if they're going through something and want to talk, and them checking in with if I'm open to talking.\n\nIts kind of boundaries - you don't need to be available to sooth someone all the time, like if you're tired, stressed yourself, need a break, aren't sure you can simply give the attention etc you'd want to give that person for that on a specific day. Your partner should be able to reach out and say when they go through stuff, need stuff, want to reach out to you. And you have the right to say when you're open to that, and when you don't want to or don't have the energy for it. So just trying to cultivate that both ways - both practicing opening up to a partner about when you are feeling things, need or want something, but also respecting their boundaries and if they can handle it at the time/want to. Whereas a therapist, I'd hope, is generally readily available to support you when you're struggling as that is their job. Also recognizing that a partner (or friend) can be with you as you emotionally process or need emotional support (if they're okay with it), but they can't heal you. Its not a partner or friends job to solve your problems, to help you figure out how to improve what you're struggling with. They might bounce some ideas off with you if you ask, and they're willing. Likewise - if someone only gives you potential things you should do to 'solve' it, and you just need to emotionally vent, then communicating with them that you just want to vent and not problem solve. And if someone can only handle so much emotional venting, then respecting that. With a partner/friend, some time might be spent on bringing up struggles/emotions, but a lot is also just spent having fun, discussing ideas, sharing experiences you do together, comfortably doing your own things and sharing your passion about it with each other etc.\n\nWhereas a therapist generally might actually be helping you find problem solving strategies, coping methods, teaching you things that may help, while also being available for emotional venting. And most of the time might be spent on these things - whereas with friends/partners this stuff might only be a small part, and more about connecting with the person/feeling supported than actually getting help from them.\n\nI read recently a strategy on figuring out if its 'safe to share' with someone, and I think it also kind of applies to figuring out how much a person might be okay with giving emotional support at a given time. You share just a little, see how they react - if they're open to it, and if they seem to be open to hearing more. If they are, you can repeat and share a bit more. Like \"hey honey I felt sad today.\" If they respond something like \"do you want to talk about it?\" etc or something emotionally supportive, they might be open to a little more sharing ex: \"My boss yelled, and I had a panic attack, it was scary. I'm still kind of shaken.\" Even if they don't want to talk about it more, your partner would now know ok you might be a little more sensitive today so they understand where you're at. If they again are open to being supportive, you might share more, etc. They might have had a rough day too, or want to move both of you onto something to relax, so maybe you guys end up doing something else. But you managed to communicate the basics of where you're at, and if you need support you can see if it might be met there. Or it might not, and then you might say you need to take some time alone to relax/sooth yourself, or text a friend who's up for that kind of conversation instead etc. Also this 'share a little' to test the water thing helps figure out what friends etc might be safe to emotionally open up to, I did it before I knew what it was lol when I used to make friends. If a friend reacts with insulting you, belittling you, attacking you, that might be a sign your friend is not only not open to emotionally supporting you at the time (which is fine) but does not treat you well if you are emotionally open. And you probably don't want to try and rely on friends who aren't at least accepting of you. \n\nYears ago, I had a boyfriend who dumped me because I cried one day and wanted to come over to just calm down somewhere safe. He let me come over, was annoyed I was sad, so he broke up. I realized how dumb it was - because a good friend would have either said \"yeah if you just wanna chill and cry and recuperate a bit at my house, its ok\" or \"I had a rough day, I don't feel up to seeing you right now.\" But a good friend wouldn't end a friendship over me crying.

What helped me a bit, was trying to learn some things sometimes I Really had zero care if I succeeded in/was perfect in. Since a lot of my anxiety was related to 'Must do your best to be good' 'must be perfect.' Etc. So like, some purpose studying of something I could make a Lot of mistakes in without bad consequences. I think its made me a bit more tolerant of making mistakes in general since doing this more?\n\nSo I love art but even that eventually would get too stressful maybe a decade ago. I started drawing just for me more stuff in only pen/highlighters, crayons if I'm really stressed. Stuff I 'think' doesn't look fancy so there's no pressure for it to look cool to anyone but me, mistakes don't matter since no eraser so I like it or throw it away. I still do other art, but pen/highlighters replaced a lot and helped make mistakes less scary. I picked up self studying languages, first just for reading. Cause no one grades me, language learning is a lot of just 'mistakes help u learn,' and with reading there's no 'right/wrong' just percent comprehended. And anything better than nothing means you're improving and learned something. Which eventually got me into trying to do other stuff, getting used to 'mistake' of not following everything but getting used to 'just some can be enough.' Idk for me its just been a safe thing to study that I don't have to be perfect in, don't have to follow any specific directions or thing I could 'mess up,' that reminded me what I liked about learning before all the pressures. Just like trying random stuff it didn't matter if I was any good at, only if I liked it. \n\nI didn't get over it. But I think purposely doing more 'make mistakes that don't hurt me' like trying creative 'no wrong answer' stuff and studying with my own study plan instead of rigid 'follow this' stuff, helps me in general get a better perspective on 'I can make some mistakes and its fine and normal and even a good thing.'

So generally its different then it used to be. It doesn't erase the thoughts I have ingrained now though, from years of being enmeshed.\n\nI've been doing a lot of reading recently. My panic attacks are probably the worst thing I'm dealing with, and I've been wondering what might help heal the intense overwhelming self-hate and guilt that triggers when they do. I realize now the awful thoughts I get overwhelmed with during them, are the things my mom used to say, do, the way I thought of myself when I lived there. Even though I'm safe now, I'm in control of my life now, my own mind has the worst of it ingrained when I panic. My mom can't hurt me again, but when I have a panic attack its horrifying cause sometimes I still do. I want to be able to bear those awful thoughts and urges I deserve to die for being bad, safe until they pass and I'm calm again and realize its not true.\n\nI started the book The Emotional Incest Syndrome, which made me start to wonder if the part of healing I just haven't done yet was fully 'understand my story' of my past. It's first big exercise to help people who'd had narcissistic or enmeshed parents heal, was to write a story of your life (it had questions to help). With the idea that realizing what you went through can help you finally start framing it as part of the past, as over, and so when writing/speaking your story you can feel the emotions/cry and grieve through the stuff that didn't get fully grieved. Which kinda makes sense in relation to like narrative therapy for trauma - putting it into a story. Well I wrote up one answer for one of the questions, and started crying and didn't stop for hours, and had insomnia for 2 days lol. So maybe that is the work I need to do, but I guess I need to find a way to be in a state to prepare for it. \n\nI guess I should've figured? I've got barely any memories of childhood, none if I don't think about it actively, most things I 'remember' are just what other people say I was like and from 'picture proved I was here once at X age.' Some memories from 12 onward, and nearly all of school or friends, like I purposely ignored the things that happened at home. Maybe that's why those are the feelings that come up during panic attacks, the feelings of older mistakes I made, that I felt awful for, hated for. So I do think that book might have some merit for these kinds of situations, I'm just not sure what a good state to tackle it in would be.\n\nI've also been reading The Body Never Lies by Alice Miller. I'm not done with it yet, but again it emphasized just like realizing what happened to us and that we don't have to love the people who did that to us, that we didn't deserve it, that if we recognize it we can process some of that. Which I want to figure out how to do, I've been having awful stomach health issues for years, and my doctor said it could be stress, and if just recognizing my life through childhood could help lessen some of that I'd want to try.\n\nLast book lol - The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel A. Van der Kolk (favorite book I've read since Complex PTSD by Pete Walker as far as giving me perspective). This book wasn't about childhood so much as ways people can heal and process trauma. It was eye opening to me, because so many books/groups like to push 12 Steps as \"the only help,\" or vice versa talk therapy, or medication. And the book really helped me feel less hopeless about if something doesn't work for me. People heal a lot of ways, its not the same for everyone, and it had some starting places for new avenues to look at that might help heal.  \n\nJust yeah, I also feel like I thought I'd moved on. But I realize maybe I haven't really dealt with being enmeshed and now I'm recognizing its still weighing on me.", "created_utc": "1622730391.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h0fyo92", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nr84co", "parent_id": "t3_nr84co", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Codependency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblj"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "At month 3 when you read your first book - did you look up unknown words as you read?

I tried to learn Spanish, German, Chinese, in school growing up - learned nothing except to pass tests. In college, I took French just to try and prove to myself IF I even was capable of learning anything significant in a language. I picked French because I'd never tried to study it, and like Spanish it would be relatively common and useful for a job. That was the initial motivation, and it made me find personal reasons to care - eventually I found old french history books I found interesting, and wanting to read them motivated me. So that was my passion. It wasn't even a lot - but it was enough I wanted to learn to read, and I sure did. I found like... part of it for me, is as I explored the languages, finding MORE to be passionate about. Because there's things worth loving, worth wanting to do in it, eventually, if you go looking.\n\nJapanese - probably knew I wanted to learn it since I was 11. I played my first japanese video game, it inspired me to get more into art (and dream of being a character concept artist one day), and I always wanted to be able to play my favorite games in their original language before localization and translation changes and loss of nuance. I did not succeed at learning anything for many years - but I always knew that's something I'd want to do. And when I eventually learned how I study languages effectively (with french), I started working on that goal. And recently, I've found more goals - I never thought I'd love japanese theatre but I'm starting to love a lot of troupes and writers, so now listening is a goal too (not just reading video game subtitles etc lol).\n\nChinese - when I took it in school it wasn't a passion, it just wasn't german and I was tired of my 2 year german class where I'd learned nothing. My teacher was from Beijing, he was really nice, believed in us (40 kids who did not care remotely to learn but he still managed to cheer us on), and kind of a role model to me growing up (one of the only adults around me at the time that believed I should pick what I loved to do and that I had the talent for it when I graduated). So I had a lot of positive feelings about learning the language, just because the experiences with it had been good ones. Then one day 2 years ago, I watch a cdrama for the first time in my life on a whim - Guardian. It is literally everything I love in a story. I'm already learning some words as I watch, since I remembered greetings and small phrases, and now I'm seeing more. I find out this show was based on a more detailed novel, which was not translated at the time. I adamantly want to read that novel - and I try to machine translate it, and try to read chinese with like 500 words I know, and its a mess. So I resolve to learn to read it. \n\nSkip to 2 years later, and that experience led me to more shows, novels, to joining chinese sites, to making friends, and now I have a lot more reasons than I used to. I have friends now I want to talk to better, which I didn't expect back then. And I'm currently reading the book I'd aimed to read, and a lot of others. And I have so much more I want to do - and I know its going to keep motivating me to learn for a long while. It's not really that I knew I was passionate about it... I just ended up becoming so. It just sort of worked out.\n\nI've always just kind of done what my feelings wanted to do. I made goals and went for them, and the goals either came from passion or helped me find things to become passionate about. I dropped japanese many times, for years in between, but I always come back to it. I know I'm always going to want to be able to understand it, so I know I'll come back. I didn't always think I'd come back to French, once I learned to read, but its gotten important to me again for other life reasons and so I'm doing more with it again. If you follow the things you care about doing, they might eventually lead to what you want to do most. Also what someone else said - you don't need to be passionate to learn. I think part of it is just keep exploring, and you will find things you want to do. I didn't have emotional attachment to any language when I start, I just ran into reasons I wanted to do things in it as I went along.", "created_utc": "1622599787.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h09l3g6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nq2tpl", "parent_id": "t3_nq2tpl", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I really broke down when I was in college. Made all my decisions to try and please people, but I was having like 5 panic attacks a day and frowning/crying also made people mad, so I got suicidal. It all built up until I quit school, finally realized people pleasing over doing what I cared about in life was gonna make me hopeless and destroy me. Even when I wanted to live back then, the panic attacks scared me - that they could happen without warning any time of day. And knowing I'd be screamed at if they happened, if a parent saw me frown or have red eyes from crying after one, or if I had one while with them. Right after that I started trying so hard to stop people pleasing quite so much, to start making more decisions I at least didn't-hate. \n\nEventually I had to move out though lol. Because even with the rest of my life getting better, panic attacks would happen sometimes and if I was home it would've been over even little things like spilling water, mom screams, I panic, I get screamed at more, I got into a horrible habit of trying to beat myself when they happened just to make the crying/breathing sounds stop so I wouldn't get yelled at more when they happened. So I finally managed to move out, and when I did of course I got screamed at, had a panic attack, and my mom ended up hurting me. I got out. \n\nAnd a lot of the time things got better. Most of the time they really do - I got a lot of friends now that I know love me, that I learned still think I'm ok if I cry sometimes or have anxiety sometimes. Who let me set boundaries, who respect me. I had to learn to ask my roommate for things the past year lol, which caused me a lot of panic attacks (just getting irrationally afraid I'd make someone mad like when I lived at home and wasn't supposed to ask someone to do anything ever). And we got through it. They didn't understand why I'd get so scared, or why when they responded sarcastically or with a loud annoyed voice I'd get anxious. But I figured out how to eventually communicate why I was scared, and figure out a way to ask us to split the housework so its not stressful to ask each other about stuff. I know its a dumb little thing, but for me it was so big lol - I'd never asked someone I knew personally to do something before without being a 'horrible person' for doing such a thing. Even though its such a normal thing in life lol. And except for these occasional panic attacks lol, and when I have to interact with family, I mostly do whatever I want, see friends I have fun with, have a job I like. Its nice doing things I pick to do, knowing if I cry or want to sleep no one will yell at me. \n\nBut this built in 'inner hate' just surges up when I still get the odd panic attack 1-2 times a month. And as soon as a panic attack hits, I feel like 'a bad person who deserves to be beaten to death, who needs to fix what I did wrong or I deserve it for being too stupid to fix it.' I know its not true, I know its just critical thoughts that are like the things I grew up with, but when I'm having a panic attack its all I can think and I just feel so immensely guilty like I have to destroy myself because I'm 'bad' until they end. The past year's just been a struggle trying to keep myself safe when the panic attacks happen. I've been doing a lot recently just trying to find a way to figure out how to keep myself from trying to hurt myself during them. Ideally I'd love to Stop having panic attacks, but I don't know if that's realistic. I finally made myself call a therapist hoping she'd help (but I got a lot of panic attacks just calling which sucked, since I've had a therapist tell me I deserved to die before and I know if I hear that and have a panic attack I may hurt myself). So we're working on cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness and I'm sure hoping these help. I've been looking into EMDR and Neurofeedback just because like, I've had panic attacks for at least a decade now. On a regular day? I can usually figure out when I'm in a thought spiral that's just gonna hurt me, and can take a break and take care of myself. But when I have a panic attack, its all gone, its like all I can think are the worst things I've ever felt, and I've hurt myself so bad during them I want to be safe when they happen, I don't want that to happen anymore. \n\nI've tried medicine but it doesn't get rid of them enough - they still happen a couple times a month, and it can be over clearly stressful stuff you can't avoid (like a car breaking) or I spill water and even though when I'm calm I know its no longer dangerous to spill water I have a panic attack and its like 'its a mistake I'll be in trouble for and need to be destroyed for' until the panic is over. I hate it, I hate not being able to prepare for simple things like that cause its just a normal thing in life - I have to drink water, I can't avoid it. I can't avoid simple mistakes, they're a normal thing in life. I just want so bad to be more sure I can keep myself safe if I happen to have a panic attack over something I can't prepare for like that. I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy before - which helped with a lot of areas of life, as do dbt worksheets, but nothing's really helped with the panic attacks.

Like I do think someone can learn to say a casual 'hello, my hobbies are X, I'm from X, where are you from and what's your hobbies, goodbye' in a few weeks/months (especially if accent or grammar mistakes isn't a concern), since that's what beginner classes teach in a few months (plus some other stuff like shopping, dealing with travel etc). \n\nBut that is a lot different from 'fully' mastering the language, and sometimes when you start and see resources made by people 'teaching (insert language) in X days/months' you don't realize that they might not actually be teaching much more than some basics. Or that their claim/proof is only really covering basics, and it took them longer to do a lot of other stuff. \n\nFunny exception is I've seen a person on youtube do a video 'learned Italian in a month,' and their video was a lot of really good advice. (https://youtu.be/3MBPPg1xAsA) They weren't selling anything so that was a good sign. They just showed how MUCH they studied nonstop in a month, all the resources they used, and what their short term goal had been - getting to a point they could start having some very basic conversations (and know enough to ask 'what's the word for X') and start to read some books with a dictionary. It involved studying nonstop all week, over 1000 words of cramming, grammar guide cramming, trying to read, and figuring out what scripts she'd need memorized to have a basic convo. She says right at the start how it got her to a very basic conversational level, not anywhere near fluency. I always liked that video because its a realistic example of how you can study well to speed up the basics so you can learn from more resources faster (she could now use a tutor with more common words she vaguely recognized, she could now study from books with a dictionary without knowing so few words it was impossible). But also how even with all that you're at a very basic level and will still have years to go. I liked that video because she crammed what I usually do over ~6 months, and it was more realistic of the very beginner results she got versus claims like ones Benny Lewis's stuff tends to make (*I do think his stuff is not bad advice to start beginning to learn a language, I just think a lot of people assume he means fluency when his books are like very 'learn to have beginner convos roughly' and will not get you anywhere near fluent).", "created_utc": "1622224082.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzs8chi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nn11na", "parent_id": "t3_nn11na", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Like I said, Listening Reading Method is only one way of using listening while reading. So you can always do any of the other ways of using listening alongside reading. The most common way being just listening to audio as you read the target language text that matches. Not a lot of people do L R Method specifically.\n\nListening Reading Method specifically: yes, that's the way to do it. \n\n- Step 1: Read in L1 is so you have context and know the story (so its skipped if its something you've read before). \n\n- Step 2: Read in L2 (your target language) while listening to L2 - to match sound to text specifically, get used to word boundaries, get used to language noises, and understand as much as you can. (This step is also in a lot of other approaches people use listening with reading).\n\n- Step 3: Listen in L2 (target language) while following along with the L1 translation, and making an effort to just understand the meaning of what you're listening to. So the L1 translation is to glance at to basically 'look up' any unknown words in real time as you listen. Some people find word-for-word translations more helpful versus literary. If the translation doesn't match content-for-content to the audio then this may not be worth doing/difficult. Parallel texts also work good for this so you can keep your place in the text and reference both L2 and L1 text when you can't understand a word you hear. \n\n- The goal of step 3 is to focus mostly on listening comprehension and just reference the L1 text if you can't understand the meaning of something you hear. If you are tuning out the audio you're doing this step wrong, this step is mainly for trying to comprehend the audio meaning fully. I believe in the original L R Method article, the person would do step 3 often 3+ times, to really get to the point of understanding all of the audio. I only do it once. (I also think intensively reading the L2 transcript to look up all unknown words/grammar, then afterward just listening with L2 audio again and your lookups with the L2 transcript, would be really similar to step 3 but take more time - and is what Wasabi Japanese's website has people do for their material instead, but its easier to do for short paragraph stories than long chapters). \n\nLike I mentioned, the original article is long and can get hard to follow. I read Yuurei's language log when she tried doing this, and that's mainly where I learned to do it. This is Yuurei's Final Impressions, and it links to her Introduction, First Impressions, Second Impressions posts at the top: https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1721&p=99415#p99415", "created_utc": "1622211688.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzrfnlh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nmcfqb", "parent_id": "t1_gzplo8o", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This is one way - Re-Reading technique: https://youtu.be/JTWKpNy96EM It has a lot of steps, not all that need to be done. But the heart of it is just at some point listening to audio alongside the text/transcript so you actually know what the words you're reading sound like spoken. \n\nAnother method - Listening Reading Method. Look up listening reading method if you're curious, I thought it was really cool - it made me consider and try new ways of studying that have been really effective for me. I made a ton of progress when I started trying this more, especially my listening comprehension. There's easier-to-follow explanations of Listening Reading Method, experiences of people who've tried it etc, if you search it - since the main article on it is quite long and sometimes hard to follow. http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm \n\nIn general though - basically, just listening to an audiobook as you read can help a lot. It helps you learn proper pronunciation of what you're reading, and helps you kick your reading speed up enough to keep up with speaking speed at least. And sometimes, listening to audio-only of things you've already listened to while reading, so that you can practice listening-only comprehension of stuff you could understand when reading before.\n\nAnother variant on using listening with reading I saw recently: listening to an audio file a few to several times just trying to recognize and get used to all sounds. Then listening with transcript to make sure you understand all the sounds you hear by matching it to text - and looking up any unknown words/grammar then. Then re-listening with and without the transcript until you feel you understand the material without the transcript. Then shadowing the audio (trying to repeat after the audio), either with or without a transcript. It's just another varied way of utilizing reading/listening, and I've been doing this more and it's helping a lot with listening comprehension/speaking skills. This article on Wasabi Japanese is where I read about it, since they discuss how to study their materials in this way: https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-lessons/japanese-lessons-how-to-proceed-with-read-aloud-method/\n\nEdit: some points to add\n\n- I've read studies that watching target language audio shows with target language subs (so ex: spanish audio/spanish subs) helps listening comprehension a little. Presumably, listening to audiobooks while reading the book helps for similar reasons. \n\n- I imagine trying to do this with audio that doesn't match the text would be confusing at best? Even in my native language english, if I'm trying to read a novel and playing music with english lyrics in the background I get confused. You could definitely try it though, I don't think I've heard of anyone trying it. \n\n- I Have tried listening to chinese audiobooks in the background while I work - so multitasking. (So target language audio while you do something requiring main attention in native language). This has actually helped, since there's breaks between moments I work and I can catch several lines of chinese and over time I start recognizing more. I'm doing this a lot more since its helping. But its like watching a show in english, or listening to a podcast in english, as I workout - I already know I can do that multitasking in english and 'pay some attention' to what I'm listening to. So it works with chinese too. However I can NOT read an english novel (focused reading) while chinese plays in the background - again, the two things require too much focus to follow either so when I focus on one I completely tune out the other.\n\n-", "created_utc": "1622137139.0", "edited": "1622137595.0", "id": "gznsuii", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nmcfqb", "parent_id": "t3_nmcfqb", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you feel you'd do most things the same, but want to talk to people you know now who speak French, then maybe French is a higher priority for you right now? \n\nAesthetics, music, food can all be enjoyed without language ability - or with you just learning what you need for specific stuff (like one day learning just enough italian to visit there and casually chat).

Talk to a person, read about a specific passion of yours, watch films, visit, etc. That might be your priority for now.", "created_utc": "1622131756.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzng4zj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nmanmh", "parent_id": "t3_nmanmh", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I think it would be harder overall. In a way I think its easier to learn with the hanzi in the long run - shows are all subbed with hanzi (so easy to watch shows and look up words), reading material is all hanzi, manhua etc. And if you use tools like Viki Learn Mode you only see pinyin if you click the hanzi, in Pleco (a great dictionary app/reader) you only see pinyin if you click the hanzi. \n\nAlso once you get used to the radicals in hanzi, they both hint at pinyin (so you can guess and look the word up with pinyin) and hint at meaning (so you can start using hanzi you know to guess the meaning of a ton of new words - like \u65b9\u5411\u76d8 is direction-plate, steering wheel, but if you only read it as fangxiangpan you'd have to guess between all the words pronounced 'fang' 'xiang' and 'pan' to figure out its just steering wheel). Also, if its a word you don't know - you'll recognize what part's new immediately because it would be a new hanzi, so you don't think it's the same 'word part' based on sound when it isn't. \n\nI think overall the sound+meaning component of hanzi ends up being a big help, especially since chinese has few cognates with english. There's only so many commonly used hanzi (a few thousand, and once you get to 1000 you recognize part of many words you start running into to help you 'guess' their meaning or remember them). So you can use hanzi to start having associations to remember new words. Whereas languages similar to latin have more english cognates so seeing marcher in french you can guess 'march' might relate to walking/moving, in chinese without hanzi you lose some tools to start guessing cognates which makes learning new words harder.\n\nThat said, if you wanted to try to learn without hanzi - which might be really helpful at the beginner stage, regardless, since you'd know some base of words before learning their hanzi writing. MandarinSpot is nice https://mandarinspot.com/ because it's Annotation tool adds pinyin to all hanzi, which would help you read stuff entirely in pinyin. Also finding learner materials (like textbooks) that cover a LOT of words in pinyin. I've seen some good beginner materials that teach ALL in pinyin to a beginner conversational level that's good enough for tourism/travel/shopping/casual conversation, which is good if it's all you want to do or if you want a good base. FSI Chinese is an old solid one - https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/FSI/fsi-chinese-mandarin.html . Teach Yourself Chinese includes pinyin for all portions. DeFrancis's chinese books are old good ones - half his textbooks are pinyin only, the other half are hanzi-only graded readers (which work well if doing the pinyin books first then learning hanzi after). I used the DeFrancis Readers so I don't know how good the pinyin only textbooks are. \n\nAlso you may want to look for audio-based study material/courses. Pinyin is ultimately just an approximation of how its actually pronounced, and a way to type out hanzi. Learning with audio is more direct if you want to avoid hanzi/wait to learn. Anki Chinese Spoonfed deck has audio only versions (or just study the audio parts), audio files, and there's many learner podcasts out there. \n\nOnce you move to watching shows though, news/reading/novels etc to pick up words, knowing hanzi makes life easier (even just 800 hanzi means making it easier to follow chinese shows and match the less common unknown hanzi to what you hear to look words up, to guess at word meanings etc). I don't know if it helps, but I studied japanese too and I can say hanzi are WAY less daunting and easier to pick up. If it's difficulty that concerns you. I found Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters (it has 800 common hanzi) helped make hanzi feel approachable.\n\nWith the lack of cognates even 'audio only' chinese would take a long time to learn compared to stuff like french. Skipping hanzi would mean no visual hints to help you figure out new words, and less access to materials to learn from/have subtitles for. So either way, chinese would take a while to get to fluent.

I read a few manga chapters this year, watched a play, played a few hours of games and managed to read it well enough to follow along. All these things I was just barely trying back right before I gave up last time, and back then I thought being able to do even this much would be amazing to me and take years. So it really was like an old dream coming true, just picking up old manga I had from then and reading them now. Playing games I had from then and actually getting what was going on.

FSI institute estimates it would take 1100 hours of study to become proficient in Thai (https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/). You can certainly accomplish some level of ability in less time (as I imagine FSI's level of proficiency means capable of working in the language which might not be your goal), especially if you have very specific goals you focus on (ex: casual conversation about specific topics very well). But realistically you might want to put in more hours if possible.\n\nWhat made me fail at learning a language before? No concrete goals. Once I started actually setting goals of \"this is specifically what I want to do in a language\" and practicing trying to do that regularly enough to gauge my progress, I had much better study plans. If I made progress I knew what worked, if I wasn't making progress it was obvious and I could change it.\n\nI studied japanese before for 2.5 years, and the thing I wanted to do with it - play my favorite video games in their target language? I didn't try to do it until 2 years in. I was too scared to try reading manga until 2 years in. I didn't start making any noticeable progress until 2 years in when I did start trying to do those things regularly. Then I realized what I needed to study more of, what I missed, and practiced using what I skills I actually needed. I gave up japanese 2.5 years in just as I started making progress. I started learning chinese and learned from my mistakes last time lol (also put more consistently daily time in so I'd cover milestones faster). Now I'm finally starting to study japanese again and its already going eons better - I know what I need to study for my goals now, and have a much better idea of what's effective versus what wastes my time. You're already doing good, noticing what things held you back last time, so you can make a study plan that works better for you this time. \n\nSo if you want to learn Thai to talk to people, that might mean looking up common words and learning them, looking up grammar relevant to daily conversation, practicing listening to regular conversational videos on youtube, practicing shadowing to speak well (and looking up pronunciation guides), practicing writing/responding how you would in those situations. Getting on language exchange apps and practicing communication in Thai regularly. Learning words about specific topics you would want to talk about that are less common, learning how to read what would be on signs you'd see, practicing using these words in your own speech. Like you said, learning from native materials that surround topics/activities you want to engage with can help - shows where you look up words, listen until you understand the full conversations, etc. You would start noticing what's helping making your specific goal more doable, and what's not helping, and adjust to a study plan that helps you the best.", "created_utc": "1621958865.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gzelxyw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nk6l0k", "parent_id": "t3_nk6l0k", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Have you tried language exchange apps?

So then on ximalaya I can look at the Chinese txt online, listen to the audio on ximalaya, and have an English translation if the novel\u2019s got a translation (novelupdates.com links to translations). I really recommend ximalaya as it\u2019s website works on mobile and computers, app is free and didn\u2019t give me trouble to install on a US phone, the app plays audio if you minimize it to read in Pleco or your web browser so you can look at text at the same time, and it\u2019s got tons of audio. \n\nAlso youtube has many audiobooks if you search the Chinese novel title and \u201c\u6709\u58f0\u201d or \u201c\u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269.\u201d Again for text I look up the novel txt with the process above.

I just read what I like. But lately I realized I may need to eventually be able to read/write decent for a job. So I've been practicing shadowing and listening lately, and I'm working my way gradually up to practicing output ToT. I'm probably going to study more intensively once covid restrictions end, as it'll be more critical for me to improve. It's funny to me that I started trying to learn once just to prove to myself IF I could learn to do anything in a language - since before French I'd failed to learn like anything substantial in 4 languages. It ended up working out, and I learned reading really motivates me.\n\nChinese - started 2 years ago, because I watched my first cdrama and it was exactly my thing, it had an untranslated book I wanted to read. That spiraled into a lot more reasons to learn - more shows, books, people, friends, wanting to know more about the perspectives etc. My study plan's worked well, I learned a lot about how I study better, and I'm looking at needing to figure out better output study skills within the next year or so. I'm currently reading and listening to target novels I started learning for, so its been a lot of fun lately. Unlike french I actually practiced listening way more, so I'm starting to enjoy audio dramas which is cool. And shows now I don't have to wait for english subs to come out. The novels finally being readable is what's really motivating me now... now I just need to learn to read faster lol.\n\nJapanese - started 6 months after French, studied it on and off for like 2.5 years and just as I made slight progress I gave it up for a couple years lol. Studying it during French was NOT a good decision in hindsight, it slowed down my progress in both a lot. And after 2 years I was only just getting to following a simple manga with a dictionary, and also finally able to stop studying French at the same time. I gave up ultimately because I knew it was going to need intensive study to improve faster, I was finishing college full time and working 50 hours a week at 2 jobs I knew I'd have no time. \n\nThen I just didn't have the time to go back later, especially when I started chinese. I knew chinese would need time only for it for a long while. I just finally started trying to pick it back up - took 2 months to re-learn what I new before, now I'm studying new stuff slowly. I already know its not getting much time until my chinese is more where I'd like it. I'm okay with that. I've wanted to learn japanese forever, because when I was 11 I got inspired to learn to draw by my favorite character concept artist, and ever since I always wanted to play my favorite games before translation/localization changes. \n\nIts been over a decade lol, but the second I played video games again recently that motivation HIT me again. So since my chinese is doing ok, I figured I'd just see if I could relearn what I used to know, which was pretty easy. Unexpected nice thing is chinese hanzi really helped my japanese kanji recognition, so I actually did get to play a couple japanese video games recently and follow it. It was brutally hard though, I know I need to learn way more grammar/kana only words. But it sure was motivating and reminded me why one day I do want to understand better. I also discovered japanese theatre recently, and I had no idea I would love it so much, so that's motivated me to care how to listen more eventually, not just read. I figure I will keep improving chinese more, continue dabbling with japanese now that I can at least do some things in it, and when I've got more time japanese will finally get some dedication again. I predict it will be at least 4 more years though before japanese is near where I'd like it.\n\nMy dream list which may never happen: Italian - I have very little family, a majority live in Italy, it would be nice to be able to speak with them like my aunt can. Russian - I quickly studied it to handle daily conversations once for several months when I had to understand daily stuff regularly, when I stopped needing it I forgot everything.

I try to study a lot of common words when I start a language, that way once I'm a few months in and get less motivated sometimes, if I do less intensive-study at least I've got a foundation. I didn't feel like doing any of my chinese study plan last month, I ended up watching a show in the language though since I felt like watching a show. This month I tried a lot of different stuff before I found stuff I liked - even if it was just listening in the background to stuff I've heard before. \n\nI can't get myself to do the flashcards I planned for japanese right now - I hate flashcards lol. But I found a japanese learning site with short little stories translated that are fun to read - its not much but I'm doing something once a week. I think part of motivating is just kinda exploring until you find something you like, even if its 'not perfect' or what you planned. And again - even if you give up and take a break, if you need rest that's ok. Yeah consistency is great, and might make your progress more reliable. But I picked up japanese and dropped it over and over for months, then full on years. And still, when I do get motivated and come back its ok, I have to relearn a little, I move onto new stuff, I remember what I loved. In the end the breaks didn't ruin things.\n\nI don't know if it will help, but what helps me is thinking like this? \n\n1. If I'm using material, keep doing the Next thing in it - because I have a tendency to just redo old material forever instead of just moving forward. It's easy to feel you're going nowhere if you keep only reviewing, so I always try to do something new so I don't feel 'stuck.' Even if I'm reviewing after a 2 year break ToT I do something new. \n\n2. Try to just do study activities that can fit in as part of hobby time - so chinese audiobooks or audio dramas in the background instead of music when I work, audio flashcard files when I drive or walk or exercise, read something chinese when I feel like reading (sometimes), watch something chinese when I feel like watching tv (sometimes - or if its got dual subs on viki/youtube just glance at the chinese subs when I have the energy to), read a chinese comic if I feel like reading comics (sometimes). If I'd normally do something anyway, just do some of it in the language - then I do something most days, even when I don't always 'study.' Like lately I've been listening to simple chinese lessons in the bg when I'm playing a game and just level grinding. \n\n3. Do what I Feel like - sometimes I just keep procrastinating because I do NOT want to do my study plan. Even if ALL I want to do is read some niche grammar guide I found from the 1930s on the language, or just some beginner website again, or some video game script, or some music video on youtube? Even if it is 'random' doing it might make me happy, and its ok to do it.

I\u2019m mainly asking about overall peoples reading improvements. I\u2019ve read 33 chapters this month, only 5 chapters (ranging from 5-30 pages) were from the book I mentioned that\u2019s been slow going. So yeah that\u2019s just one of the books.\n\nFor that book \u9547\u9b42 I pre-study by following along with the audiobook, then looking up any unknown word with Pleco while the text dictates, because I\u2019ve been using it to learn more vocab and improve my listening-only skills. I\u2019m not counting the pre-study in the post above but it\u2019s 40 minutes per 5 pages. After a week or so, I\u2019ve been going and reading the print version of the novel I have (which is somewhat different then the webnovel version I use audio with and use Pleco with), and just extensively reading it. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t spent much time reading that specific book extensively. I\u2019m also doing other study activities with it to make the reading easier (by learning all the unknown words per chapter and learning to follow along to the audiobook only), then finally extensively reading it after all that. So the book is part of 2 activities - Listening Reading Method to improve my listening comprehension and vocab, and then later I\u2019ve been extensively reading it to catch the nuance better and changes in the print edition since I can understand it well enough to extensively read afterward. So yeah your guess of 4-5 hours extensively reading it this month is probably right. When I calculated it, it was going to take ~50 hours to finish reading it extensively, not counting the other activities. Unless at some point reading speed improves.\n\nIn total a day I\u2019m usually reading a half hour, occasionally 1-2 hours. I read various things, sometimes in print sometimes in Pleco, some are easier some are more regular-webnovel level. I\u2019ve been reading a webnovel that\u2019s only 10 Pleco pages which I think might be 2 regular pages, that novel takes me 8-10 minutes a chapter depending on if I lookup words. Another couple novels in Pleco. So usually 2ish chapters a day. Most of my study times been going to Listening Reading Method lately since it takes 40 minutes per chapter because the audiobook chapter is played twice. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if people have seen better reading speed improvements after: how many books? Or when they read harder books versus just more books? Or easier books and gradually pushed upward? Or how many pages they read etc.\n\nIf extensively reading the novel that takes me 5 minutes a page is just going to slow down my overall reading progress, I could put off reading it until my reading speed improved and instead read more easier stuff for me.

It's the same problem I have with apps - so many resources cover the basics, you have a lot of choices free and paid/fast and slow to cover them. But its hard to find resources that help with lower-intermediate to help people bridge the gap between beginner material to actually being able to study from target language content. \n\nGraded readers sometimes fill this gap - but in cases like chinese, most of the graded readers are for beginners so again there's not as much aimed at intermediate learners bridging the gap into reading actual novels. In japanese I've seen some beginner graded readers, but again not a lot to bridge the gap (I've only seen one graded reader aimed to cover that intermediate zone to get a reader from beginning skills to able to read regular novels). And of course, graded readers with audio would be even better - to help listening skills keep up.\n\nRight now I think for some people, things like anki and memrise (which are mainly flashcards) is what helps bridge the gap, but its not the same as actual grammar explanations at intermediate levels would be, as actual reading and listening practice at intermediate levels would be. So intermediate learners could practice learning in context, in lessons instead of flashcards, with stuff at their level (instead of harder material they're trying to use as its all that's available). I have not used LingQ much so I imagine that may also bridge the gap and have intermediate pre-made lessons, but when I last checked I mostly saw it allowed me to upload my own stuff - which would mean varied difficulty. So yeah just, more online resources that actually GO all the way into intermediate levels (vocab and grammar B1-B2) and cover them too (duolingo doesn't, lingodeer doesn't, pimsleur doesn't, I don't think babbel does etc).\n\nAnd then a me personally thing: I would Love if there were more modern existing resources like Le Fran\u00e7ais Par La M\u00e9thode Nature (the book is very old, audio only recently exists: https://youtu.be/0uS5WSeH8iM). The book's aim was to teach entirely in the target language, to be comprehensible enough for learners to learn new vocab and grammar through the context of the story, and to continue introducing information/reinforcing old information until its taught about 3000 common words and enough that hopefully the learner can move onto sources in the target language. Lingua Latina is a book for Latin with the same kind of structure and teaching style. Its my favorite way to learn as I learn from context best. I would absolutely adore something like this for more languages - especially if like these the aim was to prepare learners to be able to engage with target language materials afterward. I ended up getting DeFrancis's Chinese Readers because they were the closest to this kind of material I could find for chinese (and the DeFrancis Readers are also quite old - I have not seen many modern materials like these).\n\n*Also what other people have mentioned: I prefer one-time purchase services (even if its $20-60+) compared to subscription models. I have never wanted to continue using the subscriptions, so I only end up using free versions of apps or one-time pay apps. Pleco is my favorite app for chinese, and it has a lot of good add-ons that cost $5-40 each depending on the bundle, but they're one time purchases. They're well worth the money, as they're going to cost me the same whether I only use the app a month or a year.

Also just the steady pace of learning materials has helped in the beginner stage - Assimil audio is that way, Coffee Break French, Comprehensible Input French on youtube.\n\nChinese is what I have listened to more though, and what helped was getting myself used to the natural speed as soon as I could. I used to listen to graded readers with slowed audio and read along. When I could follow that audio, I'd push the audio speed up a bit to practice faster, until I could handle natural speed after some months. For shows, I'd watch with chinese subs so I could read if my listening didn't keep up, but every so often I'd watch without any subs to challenge my listening to hear their speaking speed. After graded readers, I moved to regular novels with audiobooks and didn't slow down that audio. So I practiced following along to natural speed audio until I could follow without getting lost.\n\nWasabi Japanese, a cool website that emphasizes listening and shadowing, provides slow and natural pace audio. I think slow helps you catch all sounds/words, especially if you're not used to natural pace yet. And then challenging yourself to listen to natural pace after you've comprehended it slow, helps you get used to natural pace. So listening to it slow can help you notice things easier then adjust to natural speed, but I think that means you generally need to also be trying to listen at natural speed. Like others said, I think its good training wheels to help make language comprehensible and make it easier to fully hear the details, then using natural paced stuff afterward to practice hearing it faster once you've grasped it slower helps you get used to hearing those things at that faster pace.", "created_utc": "1621606540.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyy1sck", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nhf24q", "parent_id": "t3_nhf24q", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Good luck!

It does also get easier over time ToT\n\nI started with learning the most common 2000 words, just because that helped before with French and generally once you know enough common words at least general comprehension gets a easier. I also used Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters book to learn some Hanzi and common words - the book has mnemonic stories for meaning and sound. I ended up using the same mnemonic story structure to make up stories to help remember more Hanzi in words when I learned more words. Now I learn in reading so it\u2019s different than it used to be. I did memrise back at the start because I knew I could study 2000 words in a couple months (I did 2 week burst, a break of a few weeks to just review and watch shows, then another 2 week burst). I used the Ben Wheatley\u2019s common Chinese word courses (https://app.memrise.com/course/374/chinese-words-by-spoken-frequency-0-1000/ , https://app.memrise.com/course/1224/chinese-words-by-spoken-frequency-1-1000/ ) since I\u2019d read someone used that then jumped right into reading with a dictionary (which worked enough for me too). \n\nIn retrospect other things Chinese SpoonFed anki deck, Timos Chinese anki decks, are more well rounded. Basically I just used mnemonics for Hanzi, and an srs app to grind word study as a beginner so I could at least recognize a lot of common stuff ASAP. Then over time I fully learned them more. So srs apps - anki, memrise, etc, are fast ways to grind until it\u2019s easier to learn more in other ways. Then I learned words slower ways, mostly just looking up.\n\n My advice for words would maybe be: common words will help with comprehension % quickest, so if you don\u2019t know what to learn that and HSK lists are decent places to start. If you learn words from graded readers/textbooks then using materials with good amounts of content (Ive seen books with all HSK words included great, and others with 200 unique words in the entire volume which was way too little). Also having grammar understanding Helps with immersion comprehension (I read through a grammar guide the first few months before learning this many words).", "created_utc": "1621318018.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyjf41b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ne7c7n", "parent_id": "t1_gyi4mx5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I don't know about audacious. For the most part I've studied one at a time or suffered lol. I dabbled in some others but had no goals that were priority so they were dropped. \n\nFrench - my goal had been reading competence, I achieved that several years ago (took 2 years). However recently french came up as useful for my work, so I've found myself lately working on the other 3 skills I never got as solid. So listening (which I hardly ever did), and writing/speaking (which I had developed a bit once to ~A2 level just to have casual conversations - my active vocabulary is weak now from non use). It's not much of a study time sink, its mostly just listening right now/rereading references every once in a while. When I actually get to working out weak spots in production it's going to take more dedicated time - maybe some month this summer I can devote more to it (during which I'll probably just read/listen to chinese to maintain it, and drop japanese study temporarily).\n\nI tried to juggle multiple languages before - it did not work out for me lol. I think the encouragement of 'learn one to a solid level you're happy with' before picking up another is good. For me if I didn't know a language to at least B1 comprehension, I forgot what I learned if I stopped studying. Also, any time you add more than 1, its so easy to spend less time on each especially with limited study time. \n\nFor french I learned basic reading skills (6 months - read a variety of things with a dictionary and follow main idea), then started japanese as I kept studying French. Later about 2 years in I dabbled in Russian (had a short term need to understand daily conversation), Spanish (no need so didn't get far but love the language). \n\nAfter 2.5 years my Japanese was at probably N4 (or just done with N5) which means Beginner. After 2 years I could read french good enough to read whatever I wanted without a dictionary comfortably, and in japanese at 2.5 years I could struggle through an easy manga chapter with a dictionary and only barely follow the main idea. I realized japanese really took me ~4x as long to hit milestones as with french, also I'd slowed down progress in both by cutting my time in half between them. After that I gave up japanese for a while, and since I was still a 'beginner' I forgot it.\n\nChinese is my priority. Most days I spend at least 2 hours doing something in Chinese. I dropped japanese, and dropped it fully once I realized I wanted to be able to read chinese. I guessed Chinese was probably going to take 4 years minimum (for me) to probably just grasp the main idea of novels with a dictionary if it was at all like my japanese experience, and any time split between it and something else would slow down that progress. \n\nMy Chinese has been improving faster than I assumed it would - I think most of that's due to learning from mistakes I made studying French and Japanese. Like French, I immersed early and regularly. I did not immerse ever in Japanese until year 2 because I was too scared at the 'difficulty' - whereas immersion helps me figure out what I need to study and set challenging study goals regularly to make it easier, also it made chinese content less intimidating faster. With chinese I pushed myself to do listening study and immersion - I can listen to audiobooks and audio dramas in chinese if I have some context now, I never tried audio/shows in French until recently (having learned from the help it was in chinese). With Chinese I pushed myself to be more well rounded in study. What worked with French, I did with Chinese and more. What didn't work for French or Japanese, I improved. Now my chinese is getting close to a point where reading is where French was when I could start studying it less/understand without a dictionary, and listening is beyond what french ever got to. So I finally feel like I can start to spend a bit of time with other languages since chinese has some foundation now. Its probably HSK 4 (beginner-intermediate) if I had to take the test (from the samples I've seen), but I know a lot of words not on HSK since I learn mainly from reading. For example \u5c0f\u738b\u5b50 has 50% words not on HSK, and the novel was a step up from a graded reader for me (extensive reading with no dictionary), now I'm extensively reading more novels around that level (and extensively/intensively reading a couple harder ones).\n\nHow I'm splitting time: chinese is still prioritized because I absolutely want solid extensive reading at better reading speeds than I'm doing now, and natural listening skills to at least follow main ideas of new unknown content, before I stop giving it daily study time. Polishing output skills can mostly wait though if I need to.\n\nJapanese has been just 'me trying to relearn what I knew' and it ended up only taking 2 months casually doing some stuff (which just shows how bad my study habits were the first time around). When I found myself at new material I just went for it. And the lessons learned studying chinese help - I know how to study better now, kanji I recognize easier now in reading. I know now to challenge myself, what to study to improve in X areas, easier ways to do things. Japanese is getting a few days a week, and realistically its probably going to take 4-6 more years to do what I'd like. I figure 2-3 more for chinese until my skills are actually where I'd feel ok just maintaining it. Then once Chinese can be enjoyed on an as desired only basis like my French reading skills, do I want to actually start pouring the 2+ hours a day into japanese that I think it needs.\n\nI'm happily surprised going back to japanese what a difference a better study approach for me is making - I can read mangas better than I ever could before (without a dictionary), can actually approach short stories/chapters/scripts with dictionaries now, can read my japanese games (I need to do much more studying to make it feel easier though). Whereas before, I thought I'd never have a chance even partly understanding anything written-only with a dictionary.\n\nDoing more than one language never worked out for me effectively. I think its faster to stick to one at a time. I have more realistic expectations now of how long it's going to take. Japanese is going to take probably at least 4 years on its own once I'm done with chinese having priority - I'm just adding some time now, because the hours now will eventually add on and help in little ways. I was happy with my French as it was for what I wanted, its just my weaker skills recently became relevant. In the past when I juggled languages before, biggest issue was not enough time - 1 language got prioritized with limited slow study, the others only maintained. Whenever I set clear goals that helped at the time, but not a lot. It wasn't manageable for me long term. I needed time, concrete goals, and anytime those failed a language was neglected or dropped. \n\nAs of now: French will probably get either dropped (so just using as desired again with hopefully improved listening from what I'm doing currently) or become daily use (required for work) by the end of the year. Japanese I plan to keep just doing casually, to let the time add up long term, and maybe get my comprehension skills to something less likely to be lost (intermediate in French reading was when I could start studying with weeks of breaks in between, without losing skills). Either way, if I drop Japanese at least everything I've reinforced this time will come back easier. Chinese I'm doing until the things I want to do daily become as easy as I'm aiming - then I can put it in maintenance (which is less time commitment), and pick up japanese more. Which I don't think will happen for at least 2 more years. My goals aren't full fluency, just being able to do what I want/need in the languages. So what's prioritized in my study depends on current wants/needs.", "created_utc": "1621273220.0", "edited": "1621274019.0", "id": "gygxdmf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ndpb8y", "parent_id": "t1_gygjjii", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "It was the 2020 one and I'd recommend the older version - people liked that one more I think.

At first a 40 minute episode took an hour because I'd need to pause to read some lines/look up some words (I'd read through grammar guide at this point to get an overall picture, at least seen 1000 common words in memrise, and read a hanzi learning book to about 500 hanzi Tuttle's Chinese Characters). I'd picked Xiao Shi Yi Lang, and Handsome Siblings. After a rough several episodes, I took a break, came back after learning 1000 more words in a rush with memrise (so more like got familiar with them not fully learned). So month 6-7. I also picked a slightly easier show - this time I picked either crime republican era cdramas or slice of life cdramas (I picked Granting You A Dreamlike Life which is Not a show I liked lol but it was really comprehensible). I watched 15 episodes, each took 40-50 minutes because I only wasted maybe 5 minutes looking up key words here or there or pausing a sentence to read the subtitles to follow the main plot. Then once I realized I wasn't feeling a need to look up words to follow the main ideas (though lookups would've helped more details), I moved to Ancient Detective (way harder but comprehensible), Daomubiji (I was already watching it with eng subs so I knew the plot). \n\nTook another break because at a more solid 2000 words by then (now that I'd had more time to remember and not just familiarize myself with them), I pushed into reading webnovels with Pleco since I could click-dictionary lookup words. Maybe 5 months after that I got into another couple shows watching only with chinese subs, since they were brand new and I didn't want to wait for english subs. One was Word of Honor, which absolutely tested my comprehension and proved it improved a lot. I'm still baffled I followed the main plot and main detail points (I watched eng sub later when they came out, realized I missed some wordplay and specific convo details). \n\nI very much think what helped make shows comprehensible, was the point in month 5ish where I started watching shows I wanted with chinese subs only. First 12-20 minutes at a time (just because I needed to pause to lookup/rewatch scenes to follow the main plot decent enough). Then 1 hour sessions (main gist but some scenes had to be looked up/replayed/paused), to 40-50 minute tolerable watches for 40 minute eps. And that repeated trying is what helped solidify the common enough vocab and grammar I'd read about but not practiced recognizing, I think, that I got to where I could follow the main idea pretty reliably then learn some from context and words from lookup when I felt curious on details. I also don't think I understood Peppa Pig at month 5. I didn't want to watch that, I wanted to watch my cdramas lol. Now, I can understand Peppa Pig fine. Also - romance slice of life shows are the easiest cdrama genre I felt to watch (lots of very predictable settings/dynamics/words). But I don't like romance fluff dramas so I only practiced with those a little (like Granting You A Dreamlike Life - excellent practice with some fave actors of mine but not my fave show). By the time I was watching Word of Honor, a romance fluff drama I can fully follow including details with some pausing/rewatching that adds a few extra minutes (one I recommend is Two Souls in One on Youku youtube, I watched that last month since it had no english subs - it was daily life but also a mystery/more grounded). \n\nSo yes! Watch and read what you actually want! If you can't follow at least the main overall idea of what's going on (Ex: X died, Y is investigating, Z is angry about X dead), then pause/look up more words/rewatch as needed to be able to grasp at least that minimum. If you know 1000 words then this is how much I knew when I started - if you know 2000 words or more your life is gonna be so much easier than mine lol. If reading, same thing about baseline making sure you can follow the main overall idea, except easier since there's a lot of dictionary tools (I love Pleco Reader, free alternatives Zhongwen chrome extension, ios \"Lookup\" when you highlight something, MandarinSpot.com). With reading, I recommend looking around though for something you can skim some paragraphs and already follow Some main idea of though. Otherwise the word lookup may start annoying you. Also stories based on chinese shows/manhua you've seen, translations of books you've read, and graded readers all tend to be easier - either because you have prior context or the graded readers have built in ease-levels. How many words you look up in shows/reading depends on how much extra you want to learn beyond just 'figured out from context alone.' Once you've looked up enough to follow main idea (or already can follow that much), you can learn at least some new stuff from the context alone. I extensive read and still pick up things when I don't look words up. The last 3 shows I watched I didn't look up any words and still noticed they helped. Also... taking up reading more does help with vocabulary lookup, if it annoys you to pause shows, since vocab can be looked up with a quick click. I find my novel word lookups later are reinforced when I find the words in other places. \n\nI feel like just go ahead and try what you want to be doing in the language! If its absolutely too hard to do, you'll know what you need to study to make it easier, then come back later. If its surprisingly doable? You'll realize how hard/easy it feels and know you can do it again since you did it once. \n\nThings I noticed: it feels very draining at first if you're Only comprehending the main gist - you can learn from it but that motivated me to study more words asap. It gets noticeably less draining/more enjoyable over time as your comprehension improves. It was exciting to me how much you manage to comprehend, and was baffling to see how much I managed to understand in retrospect. I have a favorite novel I bought - I read the prologue  without a dictionary on month 6 - somehow grasped the main idea correctly despite understanding barely any details. At like year 1 I translated it properly with both better reading skills/vocab and other translations to compare to mine. Shocked me how many details I'd missed in month 6, but I still managed to grasp the main idea back then (so it had been good practice).", "created_utc": "1621250537.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyflatt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ne7c7n", "parent_id": "t3_ne7c7n", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I also tend to just reread, like you.

Generally, if you see the thing enough (or look it up, or review to see it) you will eventually remember it. So your method works fine. \n\nIn the book The Word Brain it mentions words take about 5 minutes to learn, considering about how many times you\u2019ll need to review (or look up etc) to remember it. Spaced repetition reviews can help minimize the time it takes to remember something. One example of a spaced repetition review schedule would be you reread your notes (or review flashcards/an app etc): day 1, 7, 16, 35. (More info: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition, https://collegeinfogeek.com/spaced-repetition-memory-technique/) \n\nIf you like rereading your notes, you could just be mindful to try to review info on a spaced repetition schedule to help put things into your long term memory efficiently. Alternatively, spaced repetition is what apps like anki, Memrise, etc are designed to do (digital method of doing spaced repetition flashcards). \n\nOther things that might help?

So basically: I make myself do new stuff everyday. If I\u2019m only doing review for one day (but it can become one week, month... worse), then I am holding myself back. Because I personally have a tendency to mull over instead of challenging myself, I like reading a lot. In reading I have to \u201creview\u201d words I know constantly and look up new words to learn, practice grammar I\u2019ve learned and look up any grammar I don\u2019t grasp. I am always forced to do some review and some challenging new stuff. I usually have one easier reading material (to really improve on what I know - while challenging non study aspects like reading speed/listening comprehension if there\u2019s accompanying audio or else shows since I can read them fine), and one harder reading material (making sure I run into actual new material daily). \n\nThis is very much just a problem I run into - not progressing and trying to be too perfect when I\u2019m better served moving on - but if you happen to have these issues it might help?

Then I found out it had an untranslated novel with more story. Almost two years later and it has a translation now (but one that cut out a lot of details unfortunately), and I am reading that novel in chinese and enjoying its audiobook! Along the way I ended up finding many more reasons to learn Chinese - to understand and have more access to a part of the world and peoples perspectives, shows and audio dramas lol, so many good novels, friends. A tiny part of me started and keeps going because I took one chinese class in high school, and I still remember how nice my teacher was. He was from Beijing and never made it seem hard, believed in us, and when I was graduating told me he believed I could do what I wanted in life. He gave me a book when I left school too which lol I never studied more back then but he believed in me, so a small part thinks if I ever met him again I\u2019d like to say I kept studying.\n\nFrench - also studied so I could read a couple 1930s books I found in a bookstore. Started studying before that by taking a college class, just to prove to myself and \u201csee\u201d if I could actually learn to do anything in another language. Before French I\u2019d studied in school or on my own spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and learned to be able to do nothing (maybe greeting/thank you/some real basics). Anyway I did end up proving I could learn to do something in a language. I was happy with my French, but recently I picked it back up to improve my listening and production skills since I might need them soon for a job.\n\nJapanese - failed to learn anything until after french proved I could learn Something lol. Started, stopped, started again. When I was young I wanted to learn to work in square Enix Japan like the character concept artist that inspired me to draw and get into stories/characterization when I was a child (and is why I can draw well now). Got older, realized I really wanted to enjoy some of my favorite stories before translation/localization changes. Still more or less that\u2019s what motivates me the most. I hadn\u2019t played video games since I last gave up studying Japanese... and I wouldn\u2019t you know the instant I played some again I started studying again. Except this time, now that I realized my favorite stories had novels (oh no), and online scripts, I am way more motivated to read ASAP. Playing video games - I can do, it\u2019s intensely draining. Reading? Not as draining, I have time and no need to \u201churry up and get to a save point.\u201d So I\u2019m happy it\u2019s gotten me to study and use Japanese more. Also I am happy in a way I sidetracked with Chinese for 2 years in between. Studying Chinese enough to read novels has made kanji a lot less daunting (still hard though, their pronunciations still confuse me intensely). But now Japanese is... more approachable in that I can recognize vague word meanings at least, so learning grammar has immediate payoff, learning words means just attaching the sound to spelling (but not struggling to recognize the \u2018spelling\u2019 itself anymore). \n\nIt\u2019s funny to me what apparently motivates me to study most is \u201cwow I sure want to read a book.\u201d ToT", "created_utc": "1621218402.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gyebpki", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ndpb8y", "parent_id": "t3_ndpb8y", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This is really amazing, thank you for sharing your progress!

And I\u2019m restarting Japanese, have my decks, I just have not been going at much of a pace.

I\u2019m getting closer to the point in chinese where I\u2019m wanting to output - I\u2019m almost to the 2 year mark and can follow shows, just improving reading/audio only comprehension now so it\u2019s easier/faster. My output skills lag a ton, and seeing how other people end up working on it will be cool to learn from/compare. Eventually when reading/listening are fully where I want them, I\u2019m planning to try maybe: shadowing, reading aloud (both for practicing actively using words/structures correctly), written output in forums/convos (so I can look up any production/vocab Im not 100% sure I\u2019m doing right), maybe a journal (I was thinking maybe re-reading through a grammar guide or HSK book then so I can practice using vocab/forms I\u2019d need for an HSK test), then maybe spoken with language partners.

But now I'm like 'mm maybe I'll see if I learn more doing step 3 a few times.' \n\nI'm not sure if this would help, but I've found some other things people have written about listening reading method. It might be less confusing, some other perspectives:\n\n- Yuurei's Language Logs (this is their final impression, with links to introduction and while they did L R Method): https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1721&p=99415#p99415\n\n- This is a summary I took from aYa's article on the method: https://rigelmejo.tumblr.com/post/650384829436870656/listening-reading-method-again-just-notes-to\n\n- A list of L R Notes/summary: https://rigelmejo.tumblr.com/post/649557560874172416/reading-the-listening-reading-method-articles-and\n\nSome random stuff (feel free to ignore lol):\n\n- You could do L R Method steps per sentence, per paragraph, per chapter, per book - whatever's easiest for you. For me I find per chapter is the easiest. \n\n- A parallel text helps a lot (or a close translation), just to keep your place if your language skills aren't great. A translation that skips sections of the original, or an audio that doesn't match the text closely, will make L R Method feel so much harder.\n\n- Some people do the order Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. Some do Step 1, Step 3, Step 2. I've found both help depending on your goals. Step 1 is generally skipped if you already have familiarity/context with the story. Step 3 is the only step strictly necessary - and helps learn words/build listening comprehension. But step 1 and 2 help with context, parsing sound, reading comprehension, if you feel you want/need it. \n\n- Step 2 can be skipped if you have a good idea of word boundaries, or don't want to practice reading in the target language. Step 2 aYa's advice is pretty clear - listen until you can parse sounds, then keep listening if you can understand a lot of the meaning (and stop listening if you can't understand any more meaning). So beginners might not do step 2 for anything but sound parsing, intermediate learners might do step 2 longer to build reading comprehension. \n\n- Step 4 Shadowing, Step 5 translating - you can wait till you feel comfortable doing them, if you even feel like it. \n\n- Step 3 is specifically trying to understand the meaning of the audio, using the translation text to figure out the meaning of the parts you hear and don't understand. So if you're tuning out the audio, its probably not step 3. (I'm guessing this is also why step 3 can be repeated - the more you do step 3, the less you need to look up unknown stuff in the translated text since you can follow the audio easier). I'm guessing step 3 is just to follow along with translated text, so you don't pause a lot and feel drained. Just learn/understand what you can as you follow along, you'll eventually pick up a lot.\n\n- Picking a long text/text with lots of vocab will probably give you more material to learn from. Versus a short simple text. But some people did simple versions first with basic sentences, stuff like Assimil etc. Doing it by sentence/pargraph, or using word-by-word translations seems to help with more different languages/helps lower difficulty. aYa's article mentions they learned some basic vocab, looked at some basic pronunciation and grammar info, before starting Listening Reading Method in a new language.\n\n- aYa's long article has some estimates for time it will take - 30 hours for significant progress, 100 hours or much more for higher competence. At least with similar languages to yours - Yuurei's experiment seemed to also show around the same timeline.\n\n- Not everyone does it the way aYa did! So if it helps you, go for it! If a variation or something else ends up working better, cool! You found a better way for you.

So after that, I just looked up more tone/pronunciation guides and learned the stuff I 'wasn't hearing right.' Which helped a lot. You might have done that since back then, but some I liked: Dongchinese's pronunciation guide since it had tone pair comparisons (https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin), and these two videos (https://youtu.be/dTOLpRWm6d4, https://youtu.be/kjXriQALpT4).\n\nI wonder that too about listening - I know when we see our NL subtitles, we tend to 'tune out' audio a bit, especially because back before we 'start learning' its not like we have any practice starting to parse the noises. But also? I do kind of suspect my chinese listening is 'where its at' because I watched so many cdramas during my learning (while some was for study with TL only, plenty of the time I just watched with NL subs). But since I was already learning the language, I might have been consciously listening more. Like, for much of my chinese-listening study it would just be a show every so often, or some learning podcast, until very recently when I started audiobooks more. But when listening, I'd already have an ok time hearing 'ok that's words I know' I just couldn't figure out the meaning together immediately, or 'that's a phrase' with only totally unknown stuff sounding like total blurs. I wonder if even picking out those bits, was because I watched so many cdramas in general - so I heard words so often. \n\nBut I think it helps a LOT of cdramas have kind of dual subs - often hard chinese subs you can look at, along with eng subs. So even NL watching, if you're learning you see some chinese words to help 'recognize' sounds. So I don't know if any NL subtitled audio might help shows wise, L R Method/transcripts with audio it seems to if you pay attention to the audio. So I'm not sure... but I do think compared to french where I NEVER listened even to shows with eng subs, my listening for chinese/japanese has generally always been better at least at noticing where word boundaries are/sentences end. (Japanese is worse though - but I also have way less practice once I started learning). Even if I don't recognize any of the words/word-together. \n\nThat said, I didn't notice significant listening improvements until I just full on started adding more listening to my day.

And I've been playing audiobooks more in the background when I work/go walking - even not paying attention much, I've noticed the past month its gotten much easier to listen and hear the words I know and Recognize their meaning, and recognize unknown words enough to look them up more easily.

So doing it a lot was probably great for you, even if it felt overboard lol. I read something recently (in the book The Word Brain) that for pretty much any language, we need about 1,500-2,000 hours listening to parse the sounds well. This can be shows/radio/audio/conversation in the background or what we're focused on - it all adds up. Its about how much we needed exposure to our native languages to parse the sounds, and seems to apply to any language people learn.

Sometimes more input will not correct an issue, if we are not consciously doing something specific to the issue. Which is why I wonder what you did to fix those sorts of issues when you outputted? Did you focus on those in your input more and how?\n\nAt least for me, I find there is a lot that can be understood in input but not used appropriately in output without more work - like in english, the words 'melancholy,' 'metatextual,' 'morever' etc. That applies to trying to output in other languages as well. In english it may have taken years or decades after comprehension of x word to use it properly - so there is the matter of speeding up correct usage in a language we are learning, since we generally spend several years learning enough to do what we need to do in the language with focused study, not necessarily decades. For target languages we will probably be learning to say less complex things - like anything we might say on reddit, so not college essays. Although some people need to go to college in their target languages. I get that my questions were kind of specific lol its ok that its not all answerable! They're just things I'm mulling over since I need to improve. While with chinese I just aim to be conversational (but as conversational as reddit so able to produce paragraphs), with french I do eventually need to be business-competent. So I will eventually need to figure out how to self-study to be able to produce grammatically correct writing - letters, essays, articles, business correspondence, announcements. So how to produce overall with few errors in writing is often on my mind lol. And since I did mostly input, with little output, I end up wondering how people who've also done mostly this approach ended up improving their output to pass high fluency tests (like B2 in a european language, N1 in Japanese etc), improving their output to be business competent to translate articles.\n\nSo you tend to do shadowing a lot, and repeating native speaker's speech?

How well could you comprehend them - the main story, or main story and most details, or every single detail?\n\nFor output, once you did start speaking/writing: how did you improve active vocabulary? And when you noticed an output mistake - probably just you forgot a word for something/how to say something, how did you improve it? Did you look it up? Did you not notice, and a conversation partner pointed out your mistake? Since output-skill does lag behind input-comprehension, how did you improve output when you did eventually start outputting?\n\nI don't need to think about grammar when I consume media (read/watch shows/listen). I just get it. But when I write to chinese friends, they often notice words I forgot to use - I forget to use a measure words often (I can input-comprehend them, but constantly forget them during output). I will be told by them \"this phrase is used more\" compared to what I said. So while I'm not doing grammar drills, clearly I am making some language mistakes when outputting. I need to know how people fix them at this point - do they STOP output and consume more input? But what do they focus on during input? Because clearly I can understand these words/grammar points very well during input, yet still forget them during output. So what else has to be done during input to improve this issue?\n\nIn our native language, we improve output skills in elementary/high school english class, doing essays, being required to write with more vocabulary each year, and writing and being corrected repeatedly for years. So we know what we had to do - that was a lot of work lol. Even if our comprehension is high we do this for years (which it should be - by age 9 I feel most kids can understand most anything they want to talk about/read although they are not mature enough for it all yet). And as kids we needed 5-9 years to get that level of comprehension. And if you count college, some people don't have adequate output skills for adequate speeches/essays until some college classes. \n\nSo how much input do we need before outputting (how many years/hours roughly for perhaps x language you did)? What should our input-comprehension skills be at? And how do we improve outputting when we DO start it at a reasonably fast rate? Since we won't want to take a decade to become business-competent like children have to (school from kindergarten to age ~15 when they may be allowed to apply for some jobs, or start taking AP/college-level classes). \n\nLike my chinese example - since my chinese output skills are lagging 52% behind my input-comprehension skills. Even if I reach a stage of input-comprehension where I'm Ready to output more (like 80%+ comprehension). My chinese output skills (if I'm lucky) would be at 28%. That means my output-skills will still need a LOT of improvement to become business-competent, to generally be error free and functional in most common subject areas. I have no idea how I'd improve the output skills At that stage? Do I shadow? Do I write out journals, copying structures of sentences I've seen so I can ensure my grammar is error free? Do I have a tutor/language partner correct me? Do I look up words when I have words in my passive vocabulary I need to move into my active vocabulary? How do I move words into my active vocabulary? What have you done during the output stage to develop these skills?\n\nThis is definitely not true of everyone - but for me, I notice input does not translate to remembering how to use a structure for output. For example - I can see a million french words, and if I've never spoken/written the la/le for them repeatedly I will never remember what gender they are. Because when I hear/read them, I have zero need to remember if its la/le, I only need to recognize la/le as 'the.' So when outputting french, even if I input more, I will not be able to correct this 'thing I forget' from input activities. For chinese - I can see and understand measure words, I can even recognize if the right or wrong one is used (like pair of shoes - you wouldn't say a cup of shoes). But when input-comprehending, I must only recognize \"that was a measure word, it meant type-shoes\". Chinese also does measure words with days, people - so \"the type-person\" \"the type-week.\" To comprehend that, I only must recognize it is the correct type when listening/reading. When speaking, I often find myself saying \"the person\" and \"the week\" and omitting the measure word. In part, this is because sometimes the 'type' is not included with words like person, week. So sometimes you really do just read \"person\" in chinese or \"week\" on its own. So as a result, I just know in input-comprehension \"both the type-person and person mean 'person'.\" So when I output, I find it hard to recognize when which sounds appropriate. So I sometimes output incorrectly. And no matter how much input I get, it doesn't help me improve this output issue. (As a native language example: I messed up there/their/they're word usage until I was 17 and looked up the meanings because I sometimes used the wrong word, same with then/than, and for many people to/too). Input alone does not fix these types of output issues, so I don't know what activities will - do I do grammar exercises, just note down corrections, write example Correct sentences and practice them, shadow correct sentences?", "created_utc": "1621106247.0", "edited": "1621106491.0", "id": "gy8udjv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nd0yhu", "parent_id": "t1_gy8p6jh", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Have you done this to the level of eventually speaking/writing? I'm really curious how it worked for you. I think Refold/mia is similar in that it suggests input-only study for the first 1-3 years, then output writing/speaking once you feel comfortable you know the stuctures. Then at that point, some people get tutors (I imagine to correct mistakes/help their active vocabulary but I don't know exactly why), some people make more anki cards specifically on things they want to start outputting (so improve active vocabulary), do shadowing (again probably to help active vocabulary, pronunciation). In Refold, outputting generally starts after 1-3 years when they feel they have good overall comprehension of shows/audio (not necessarily novels but also novels if they read). But they really don't make clear WHEN they should be able to output 'naturally.' Or how they improve those output skills AT that point. \n\nSo what is that point in your experience? When were you able to output? How was your output when you started - did you make any mistakes, did you have to do anything to improve active vocabulary (aka transfer vocabulary from passive-understanding only into active vocabulary)? Did you shadow? Did you talk to people frequently, or output to yourself like videos/practice conversations/journaling? When you found outputting weak spots (couldn't remember a word, a language partner mentioned you made a mistake), how did you fix it?\n\nFrom my personal experience, waiting to output has always just meant - my output skills didn't develop. There was never a point when output 'got' easier. I can read french without a dictionary - I did not listen, as you describe, so perhaps my 'reading' messed all this up according to you. However, I can't 'naturally' output writing either. When I do have to communicate in french, my writing is very much A2 level with probably a bit more vocabulary, whereas my reading is probably B2 (whatever I want without a dictionary). So... must input comprehension be C1 through listening/watching Only before you can output the only way output will naturally come? That seems a bit... extreme, as many people will never learn to C1-2 level anyway, and many people will find they can accomplish the basic language goals they had (and start wanting to speak) in the B1-2 area.\n\nI took a comprehension test recently (input) and I got 71% for Chinese, 99% for my native language english. My output skills on the test were 19% for chinese, 86% for english. So theoretically, once I'm absolutely perfect at chinese and understand it as Thoroughly as my native language in all respects, I should aim for output skills of 80-86%. (I say as low as 80% since the test had many vocab questions related to context of the culture, and me not living in China means I may assume reasonably I might not catch if where the test was written which word for eraser/trolley/etc is more common - which is also probably why I missed 14% in english production, I didn't have all of the same cultural background of wherever that english test was written). \n\nWell at my current rate of output skills lagging behind input comprehension skills in chinese... unless at some point output gets MUCH better 'naturally,' then even at 99% chinese input-comprehension, I'd only have 47% chinese output-production skills. Which is pretty awfully low - compared to how it should be in the 80%s if I understand 99% of input. And my goal is NOT to understand 99% of chinese input anyway, its to understand enough to read/listen to what I want in the language comfortably (I won't need to follow academic lectures for instance, its not my interest). So I'll probably work toward an 80-90% comprehension rate, before I'd need to start bringing my output-skills up to the same level. And my output skills, as mentioned, are lagging 52% behind the input-comprehension skills. (This is a link to the productive-output and receptive-input vocabulary tests if you'd like to try them out: https://itt-leipzig.de/about-the-vocabulary-tests-2/?lang=en )\n\nI tested output production skills with a vocab test that tested by having the person fill in the blanks in sentences - so I wasn't reinforcing bad grammar or bad word usage. I was just being given sentences as context and asked to fill in the correct word that would go there - which, if output eventually improves with input-comprehension skills, should mean I'd be so familiar hearing/seeing that context in input I should know the right words that would go there. However - while I can understand the context, recognize a ton of chinese when listening/watching/reading, I cannot recall from memory the correct word to fit the context nearly as easily (an output skill probably related to active vocab). So, when does this get better? How much input-comprehension did you have to have, to obtain decent output skills?\n\nAlso, why does your method avoid reading? To avoid a bad internal voice? I read while listening to the audiobook often, and now when I read I've got enough listening I have a good mental voice. But... if your output only 'naturally' benefits from input if you avoid reading entirely, I cannot do it. Reading is a major reason I learn a language. To avoid reading until I'm otherwise at a very high comprehension level is to avoid the main thing I want to be doing in a language.\n\nBasically, I'm just really curious how this study method worked for you in the end stages. When you did start outputting. How did your output go? What did you start doing, change, continue doing, do different etc? I find there's so little information out there of people who do input-only study first, output later, especially about what they did during the output stage. So I'd love to learn from your experiences. Because currently, with what I've been doing, I do not see my output skills improved much at all from input-comprehension. (I can understand a conversation partner easier, yes, and with active vocab I only need to look up words to Remember to use them not to learn them in the first place, but those aren't the actual output-production skills I need to eventually improve - my reading/listening is getting really good in chinese and at a certain point it will be where I'd like, but my output is absolutely pathetic so I'd love to learn what others have done to improve at that point).", "created_utc": "1621101616.0", "edited": "1621101833.0", "id": "gy8kusa", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_nd0yhu", "parent_id": "t3_nd0yhu", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I expected this to be a list of the books written by polyglots like How I Learn Languages by Kat\u00f3 Lomb, which I read and loved. \n\nThat said, good luck on your journey! Reading motivates me so much in language learning! But all the books I wanted to initially read in chinese are such long reads (for me 30-40 hours), that I've been looking for shorter books to also want to read and build my reading skills up so those longer reads will eventually take less time ToT. Funny enough Le Petit Prince translated to chinese was the first chinese book I finished. So part of my exploring lately has been finding easier and intermediate level things I want to read too. I also want to read Le Rouge et le Noir. It's even referenced in one of my favorite chinese novels and I haven't read it yet, even though I learned french for reading first ToT. And a personal english book recommendation if you feel like it? In my english classes in school we had to read a lot of these, and Frankenstein by Mary Shelley was one of my favorite required books we had to read, although its not on here. (Also the writing styles of Mark Twain, Ray Bradbury, Virgina Woolf, Franz Kafka, Haruki Murakami, of which we read various selections of their works).\n\nHow much progress have you made, have you read any of these yet?

Some youtubers also have a bit of an 'announcer' voice, particularly during the same kind of content. Just be aware of if they sound like they're speaking or making announcements - it probably doesn't matter, I'd imitate an announcer voice if I had to make a video, do a presentation in public. But talking with my friends or having a conversation I wouldn't need to project as much or sound as clear.\n\nNPR is a good recommendation, they often talk like ordinary people when they do discussions, or like news broadcasters on television.

So they studied regularly, and kept studying material that challenged them. \n\nWhether you study from textbooks, youtube, flashcards, classes etc - studying regularly for years, studying progressively more challenging material, you will make progress. (Now if you pick study methods you like so you go through them faster, study more hours per day, you might make progress faster...)\n\nAnd just what personally helped me: setting goals. Specifically goals about what I want to do in the language - now, in a month, in a year, when I feel I've 'learned enough.' These goals change as I learn more, but they help me figure out what I Actually need to study versus what wastes my time. And I try to DO my goals every so many weeks/months, to see if I'm making progress - is my study plan actually helping me improve toward that goal, do I actually not care about that goal (in which case I should make a different one) etc. When my goal was: learn a language - I made no real progress. When my goals were things like learn to read the news - I looked up How people did that, followed their study plans/made my own, learned common words, read a grammar guide, practiced, and got better. Learn to read novels - helped me find graded readers, again figure out a good study plan for that, regularly practice reading novels and gauging my plan. Goal was to improve tones: look up pronunciation guides, listen to youtube guides, do tone pair drills, practice shadowing, use tone pair drills to test if I'm improving, made progress. Goal was improve writing about x topics: try, see what words I still didn't know but 'needed to look up,' see what grammar I had trouble writing, so I knew what words/grammar to study. \n\nFor me concrete goals like: watch this show and follow the plot, read this specific book, be able to talk about this topic - I can break down into smaller goals, and longer ones, and actually do things to make progress and check I am actually learning to do what I want to be able to do long term. Before I made specific plans, I only made some progress if I luckily ran into a good study material and stuck with it - but that wasn't as reliable or motivating. And since I had no 'end goals' I didn't know what I wanted to be able to do. \n\nAlso what helped for me, I imagine helps others? Finding ways to 'need' the language on a regular basis. You'll learn to do what you want to do, if you 'need' to do it regularly. That's maybe part of why immersion helps - either in a place you must speak/do things in the language, or watching/reading/listening where you must learn to comprehend if you want to follow the main ideas. So if your goal is writing, write daily journals/message language partners/make it necessary to write, if it's speaking ditto speak regularly with a language partner/tutor/family or make yourself try new topics every so often, if its reading try to read regularly (subs in target language, webnovels/comics original instead of translations, put news sites/wikipedia/google etc in target language etc).

I DID finish reading some shorter novels this year though: \u5c0f\u738b\u5b50, some graded readers. I now have a better idea of what difficulty and length I can finish in a reasonable amount of time (I'm half through a 20 chapter story and will probably finish it in 1-2 more reading sessions since its written easier).

I tried, even got some more japanese games. The good news: knowing hanzi from chinese puts me miles ahead where I expected to be, I can get the main gist as long as I slow down. Bad news: it really makes it apparent I need to study japanese grammar more, since it was brutal hoping for a save point and not getting one until I read 1 hour of text. If I knew more grammar and kana-only japanese vocab (aka just knew more japanese), it would get less draining.  So... I tried to do it again, which was step 1 of the goal!

Also Timo's Chinese anki decks are nice (there's a grammar one and sentences-vocab one). Once you feel you've done enough RTH, you'll want to start learning common words somehow (premade decks, sentence mining etc). Anything else you should be doing - you might want to look up a grammar guide and read/skim through it. Or add a sentences-grammar anki deck.

You might want to look up a pronunciation guide just to get more familiar with tones and tone sandhi ahead of time. I liked this pronunciation guide: https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin I learned my first hanzi with a book (Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters - had 800 hanzi).

That's what Heisig's Remember the Kanji book helps people do, what https://kanji.koohii.com/ website does (it has mnemonic stories people wrote so you can read them to help you remember). At some point you should look up a japanese kanji radicals list - just read it, no need to memorize. But become aware each kanji is made up of smaller shapes that look like things too, just combined in various ways.

Write them out, you might just need the muscle memory? If you've already learned the words in hiragana (which you probably have) then you might only need to practice the kanji with your actual homework. If you type homework, then type with the kanji. Since you know the word, simply seeing their actual kanji spelling more often might help you remember more (so class online discussions, homework, notes, etc).\n\nSome people use anki or memrise. They're srs flashcard apps. Since you only need to learn ~100, find some deck and click 'ignore' on all of them except the ones you need to study (or just study the first couple 100 it will probably include most you need to learn). Study the 100 you do need to study (should be doable within 30 minutes or less in one day, or 10-15 minutes each for 2 days). Then keep doing reviews (so just reviewing those kanji) when the app says to - which will be less and less over time. Should not take long to study 100. In anki/memrise, 20-100 are pretty easy to study within a day as long as you have some spare 5 minutes here and there (on a bus, between classes, in between other homework, before bed, during breakfast, during lunch etc). It just gets hard when you keep adding '100' a day. But since your end goal is only ~100 total, you could study 20-100 a day and still learn the kanji you need to know in a couple weeks to a month. I'd suggest any anki decks or memrise user-made courses - so google 'memrise kanji mnemonics,' so that the stories help you remember easier than just rote memorizing.

With french, I found informational writing much easier (news, wikipedia, psychology, learning books about other topics, history). I think maybe I had more cognates to rely on in informational text. As I learned more, fiction or nonfiction made less of a difference. I still think cognates make nonfiction in some languages much easier - I have a spanish linguistics book I can generally read some of, even though I haven't studied spanish. The cognates and subject matter knowledge help me follow it. \n\nWith chinese, I find fiction to be easier to read - I think because I have more sentences to look for context and useful information. With news every sentence is vital, with fiction I can read a 2 paragraph description and just need to realize it meant 'they're in a city with 2 major areas one falling apart one rich and built up, they're worried, someone died.' I don't have to understand the many metaphors and every single word to get the overall plot.

There are some people who've studied languages using the '10k' sentences plan (for chinese), and I've seen some of them use tatoeba for their sentences. So they probably had similar amounts of sentences with errors, that they ended up studying. After enough learning, it didn't seem to hinder them. So using clozemaster sentences I would assume the same. Also I think if a sentence is reported as wrong, clozemaster removes it - but I'm not sure if only premium members can report sentences.\n\nI do think clozemaster is more useful at an upper beginner/intermediate level. That way you can tell pretty easily if the sentence is not a literal translation (there's some tatoeba sentences where meaning is 'right' but the translation isn't literal at all so you can't match it to the words), or when the translation is clearly wrong. The most common 'errors' I ran into were: translation isn't literal (which is fine if you're learning sayings and translation is close enough), actual cloze word's definition isn't literal (the much more confusing issue and I usually ignore those sentences if I didn't figure out it's actual meaning).

If I can, find \"comprehensible input\" channels on youtube (like Comprehensible Input French, Learn Korean in Korean, Dreaming Spanish etc) - they're made to be comprehensible at whatever level you are, so if you watch them you should be able to learn new stuff just from context. If I can, find graded readers - books tailored to your level in the language, so you can learn new word meanings mostly just from context in the story. These things are great as a beginner, because they don't feel as hard as immersion in regular shows/novels.\n\nWhen I just want to use native content: watch whatever show I want. Sometimes I watch it with english subs first (or english/target language dual subtitles). Dual subtitles are good for when I'm a beginner and just want to compare how grammar looks, or learn some simple words by comparing the subtitles.  \n\nWhen I immerse now I just watch in the target language (sometimes with target language subs). Target language subs are good for practicing reading, matching writing to sound. No subtitles are good for listening-only practice. I try to follow the main plot - pause and look up words that seem important, if I can't even follow the main plot/main key details. Look up enough words I can follow mainly what's going on. As long as I can follow along with the 'main overall ideas' I can learn some things just from context as I watch. So - look up words that seem like they'd help me understand, or I'm curious. I usually look up a handful of words an episode. Lately, I might pause and replay a few scenes to figure out the meaning of some words, but often don't look up any words. If I looked up more words I'd probably grow my vocabulary faster though.\n\nI need to understand the main overall gist to learn from context (so if I don't want to lookup words). So I either need to have seen the show in english first (so I know the plot and can guess what some words/phrases mean when I watch again without english subs), or I need to know enough words to follow the main idea without a dictionary (or only need to look up a handful of words to grasp the main idea). When I started immersing with shows, like month 5, I watched simpler plot shows and would pause some scenes the first few eps and look at the target language subs and re-read them. I would look up words that seemed important. I improved a lot doing that. At first 20 minutes took me an hour to watch. Then finally 40 minute shows took me 1 hour to watch, then finally 50 minutes to watch (since I was pausing less). And that's when I started watching shows much more. Usually the first few eps are harder, that's ok - there's more new vocabulary specific to the new show. See if it gets easier once you're used to a show.

Specifically though a goal. I was learning French once because \"I'd failed to learn spanish, german, chinese, after years of school classes.\" So I just wanted to see if I could even learn any language. I still didn't really feel motivated. \n\nThen I found a book in french at a thriftstore. I really wanted to read it, since I'm a history nerd and it was published in 1930s. It was only in french - I had to learn enough french to read. THAT is what motivated me - constantly trying to read it, looking up \"how to learn to read in french\" etc and following advice, trying to read easier stuff like news/wikipedia, all trying to work up to reading that book I got. It worked! A couple years, and I learned enough to read whatever I wanted in french (one year to read the book I got and get the main ideas without a dictionary).\n\nStrangely the same thing happened with chinese. I studied it in high school, got a good grade but learned nothing except hello, thank you, numbers. I watched my first cdrama ever 2 years ago, it was exactly my kind of story. I wanted more and found out it had a novel! The novel... was only 1/4 translated, and translated badly with whole chunks missing. I really wanted to read the novel! I tried machine translating the chinese, it was still pretty awful to read lol. I started learning chinese. Its been 2 years and I am now reading the novel I wanted to read! Its slow, but its happening! So my advice is... find something you REALLY wanna do in the language: talk to a family member who ONLY speaks X language well, read a historical text only in X language, your favorite hobby has more information/events but only in X language, you have a favorite novel/show/book and you really want to read it before translation changes, you make a friend on a language exchange app (or in town) who barely speaks english and you WANT to have deep conversations. Find something you WANT to do in that language. Then you will find yourself looking up how to learn to do THAT, how to study for THAT, and you'll care about what you do more because it will help you do what you Want, and anything you study will help you do more of what you Want to do.\n\nOther things that motivate me - are you competitive? I'm not competitive, but I am the kind of person where if someone says \"I did x, and this was the result!\" And I want to prove for myself if \"x\" really worked. So a lot of the time when I'm not motivated to study, language \"challenges\" motivate me a lot. \n\nI've seen the claim \"listen to 1,500 hours of your target language and your listening will improve.\" So now I'm much more motivated to turn on chinese in the background as I do stuff, and 'test' if it actually helps. When I started learning chinese, I read an article where a guy said he\" \"read linked article on hanzi radicals, 2000 common chinese words on memrise then started reading with a click dictionary app Pleco.\" So guess who copied him? I downloaded the same deck, did what he did, and saw if it worked (it did - but I also read a grammar guide online my first few months). While what he did was imperfect - and in retrospect I think some other things might have helped me more - I did what he did, and it DID make reading possible with a dictionary. Which made me super happy - 8 months in I was reading manhua, reading webnovels with a click-dictionary, and chatting on language exchange apps.\n\nI am currently seeing people post that they \"read 50 books in their target language to get from B2-C1\" or \"read 2700 pages is when chinese started being 'easy' to read,\" or \"read 10,000 pages when french became 'easy' to read.\" And because I like seeing if what other people did actually 'works' I am finding myself tempted to read more, and see if I'll make similar progress when I hit the milestones they did. It definitely motivates me to read more! When I found out about the Listening Reading Method, I was tempted to try it just because of the claims of improvements the people who did it saw - especially in listening comprehension. So I started doing it - and keep trying to do it to test it for myself. As of around 10 hours in, I'm excited that I'm getting similar results to others at the 10 hour mark. So I'm motivated to keep trying. When I first ran into mia/Refold, the biggest thing was I saw people say how much immersion helped them. So I challenged myself to immerse daily, instead of monthly lol - to see if I'd see benefits too. Each time, whether I got benefits or not, these challenges I did always got me to study more regularly. \n\nBut also? If you try a challenge and don't get the same results? 1. You got yourself to study so it still helped. 2. You might have learned what helps/doesn't help you, what you like/don't like.

I took these classes at community college: I took a beginner japanese class (all online), and a beginner french class (in person) - both courses were really great intros. I think a good teacher will: pick a textbook and/or exercises to actually help you practice all four main skills reading, listening, writing, reading. And that teacher will try to give you some suggestions on how to learn more yourself - since even if you take more of their classes, into intermediate, their course plans may not cover everything you want to learn.\n\nMy japanese class used Genki I. The teacher would have us shadow the dialogues in each chapter, we'd have to record ourselves and get graded based on how similar it sounded to the book's audio. While this sounded so hard at first? It was clearly Shadowing she was trying to make us do, and it helped our listening skills and pronunciation sooo much. Even though we didn't get to meet in person to practice it. Even better, shadowing is proven to help your listening skills, and we were shadowing clearly correct pronunciation not a teacher who might make a mistake or another student who definitely might. \n\nShe also made us do speaking assignments, we'd record ourselves speaking paragraphs we wrote for assignments - so more writing/speaking practice. She gave us kanji worksheets beyond what the book had, to help with kanji study. And we got a little reading/listening practice from working through the book. We got grammar/vocab from the book. So we had a well rounded course. The biggest drawback was... Genki does not cover a lot of material lol, so the class of course covered all beginner stuff. But because the teacher showed the importance of making SURE to practice all 4 skills, I knew when I went to go self study after that class that I'd need a plan to study/practice all 4. I knew I'd have to find grammar explanation, more vocab, reading and listening materials, and do something to practice my writing/speaking. I knew I could either use Genki on my own more and do as much as she had us do - which makes the book quite useful. Or if I found my own resources, either with or without Genki, I'd need more kanji help somewhere else (since even she gave us extra kanji study material) and I'd need more vocabulary/grammar (if I wanted to learn more than Genki had). \n\nMy french teacher did something similar. Her class just covered the basics, we had written homework, and spoken (record ourselves) homework where we shadowed audio from the book to learn proper pronunciation. The book covered basic grammar and vocab, she also had great pronunciation and had a lot of speaking conversation practice in class to practice producing language without preparation or with just a structure of dialogue to start with and practice. So as far as materials - the textbook in combo with what she chose to have us do, practiced all 4 listening, reading, speaking, writing skills.\n\nWhere she shone though? She thought it was important to immediately teach us basic past, present, future tense (j'ai x - I have verb, je x - i verb, je vais x - i am going to verb). She also taught us the er verb conjugation, then gave us 200 common er verbs and had us practice for a week using all of them in class to say a huge amount of things. She taught us how to recognize cognates so we could use what english/french was similar to help us. Those extra things meant with a dictionary we could start saying things about our past/present/future, asking about all of those, and using a huge amount of er verbs and cognates. When I went to self study afterwards, that foundation helped a lot. It also helped me realize what to look up myself - look up cognates and similarity patterns to recognize more words, look up common grammar to increase what I comprehend asap, use the amount I can say to start googling things in french to find more french materials. Etc.\n\nIn summary: a good teacher will pick resources and assignments that will teach/practice reading, writing, speaking, listening. Either they will use a traditional material and make sure they can teach all 4 skills with it, or they'll use more than one resource/activity to make sure their students study all 4 areas. And they will also have suggestions if you want to learn more - if you want to know more about grammar, they'll be able to suggest some grammar guides online (my teachers both did this), if you want to know how to recognize cognates they'll tell you how or show you where to find out (my japanese teacher went into katakana words, my french teacher always pointed out cognate patterns). Ultimately a college course will be limited by its course plan - if they have to use X book then they have to focus on teaching what's in it. Whereas you may wish to read novels sooner than their X book prepares a person, or to have conversations about your sculpting hobby but X book never teaches the word sculpt etc. But they'll try their best to give students ways to develop all 4 skills, and help students find more supplemental resources if students need/want them. \n\nA note: not all classes CARE about developing all 4 skills, so if the syllabus is online before you take a class you may want to look at it ahead of time. My college's language classes in general seem to always plan to teach reading, listening, writing, speaking. But I have a friend taking chinese at her college, and they only teach writing/reading, occasionally listening. There are no speaking exercises ever, no shadowing exercises ever, the teacher's goal is not to develop any speaking skills of students. This isn't a covid thing/online thing - my japanese class was entirely online, and speaking/listening skills were very much part of the course.", "created_utc": "1620744771.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxqhc3e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n9xsnf", "parent_id": "t3_n9xsnf", "score": "13", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "As a supplement its good!

And even people who've done that, duolingo usually contains about a beginner's course worth of material (2000-3000 words, beginner grammar),  so those people who used it successfully as their main tool usually eventually branched out while doing that course - into native content like shows and books to start learning more words, other grammar guides to look into more topics. And moved fully into self-study by other means once the course was complete. So duolingo can work as a primary study method? If you really grind and are the type to do a ton of it frequently, use outside methods too, and push yourself to use outside material once you feel ready. \n\nBut I don't think most people use duolingo that much or expect that they would need to - and at 15 minutes a day, duolingo is mostly more useful for practicing as a side tool. Whenever I tried to use duolingo, it covered material at such a slow pace, that when I switched to any other study material I liked I was making progress faster.

Which is where I was at in January. Also seeing you did a listening marathon too, I'm going to go check that out!\n\nI was wondering: do you think switching to some graded readers and children's novels in progressive difficulty at first, helped ultimately?\n\nThis past fall and winter, I was trying to just push through the novels I most wanted to read - so decent amount of vocabulary, 100-200 chapters each (my print books being 600-1000+ pages). Each chapter was taking me at least 20 minutes, so I was reading through them very slow. I made improvements (it used to take me 45 minutes per chapter) but still was reading them ultimately so slowly. Like you describe, it was taking around a month to get through even a 3rd of one of the shorter novels.\n\nRecently, I've been trying more 'easy' extensive reading, wondering if that might boost up my reading speed. I started with some chinese graded readers I had from back when I started studying (but never had finished reading), then I read through The Little Prince in chinese in a week. So moving onto children's novels in chinese - that was by far the easiest/quickest read I did in chinese. Now I have a few more short novels I've found (20ish chapters instead of the usual 100-200), and a few more authors I know tend to only use 3000-5000 unique words. I think The Little Prince only uses around 2000-3000 unique words, which is why it was easy to go from a graded reader to that book. I'm wondering if working my way up to difficult material, by reading these 'somewhat easier ones' first would be helpful to me.\n\nAfter The Little Prince, I went back to the adult difficulty novels I was reading - which I am still reading at 10-15 minutes a chapter (though the time has improved a bit!). \n\nSo I'm not sure if I'm pushing myself again, and its going to just be a month to read even part of a book still.

Words are taught individually and in sentence examples, there's audio and text for everything, and memrise varies the tests so I have to practice reading, listening. Also the courses go through Tae Kim's grammar guide, part of another grammar guide, at least 2000 common words, at least all the common use kanji. So it has enough material in it to make some progress and use it to push into reading/listening with target language materials. While I love a lot of japanese resources, when I found this one its what took my japanese from useless to beginning to read and comprehend things in the language so it works well for me lol.\n\nOther decks I've found effective: \"x-language common words.\" Literally any deck labelled that, with 2000-5000 words, has been of some use. Just because going through common words asap helps with learning from other materials so much. I've liked Spoonfed Chinese anki deck (common words, audio/text, in sentences) but I like just listening to the audio files more. I've liked Chinese Anki Deck: Timo\u2019s All-In-One Deck (Timo made some for a few languages), because it had grammar, vocab, pictures sometimes, and sentence examples - I didn't use it much but appreciate its content. I've liked Mnemonics - 3018 Simplified Chinese Hanzi anki deck, because its hanzi with mnemonics, so I could just grind through and use something like that instead of Heisig's Remember the Hanzi (although I added pinyin to my deck because I wanted to learn pronunciation too, and only used the deck for 400 hanzi when I was filling in gaps in between hanzi I already knew).\n\nIn general, if using premade decks, I like: a lot of common words to start, grammar points, and hanzi/kanji (and like kana if just starting japanese). These could be one deck or multiple you use together. But good for a quickly studied base. After that I learn words other ways as soon as I'm able since I hate using flashcards - but if you enjoy flashcards, branching into making your own eventually gets more useful. \n\nThe ones I like generally start with: writing system, pronouns/verbs that are Common (he/she/it/is/walk are all pretty common), sentence examples, grammar points, audio and text. They might not all be the same deck, but a few.\n\nA deck I think is imperfect but worked great for me? Chinese words by spoken frequency 1-1000, 1001-2000 by Ben Whately on Memrise. They're not perfect - there's a few errors, there's no sentence examples its just words. But it had audio/text, and was common words, and that was bare minimum enough. Someone else learned this, read a grammar guide then started reading chinese. So I copied their plan to a degree - it worked for me too. I did those words, read a grammar guide, read a hanzi reference book (400 characters I got through), then I started reading with a click-dictionary. It worked. So while in retrospect a sentence-including deck like Timo's or Spoonfed Chinese I think is way better, this one is my favorite for chinese.

But since I didn't practice listening skills much, with french mostly listening I only picked up words I 'already knew' from reading. I wonder if the nature of listening practice is just... most words will get learned in context with text or visual first, and reinforced with listening.\n\nI did read something recently that reinforces Refold's ideas about lots of listening practice still being helpful though. I read The Word Brain, a book about language learning, and it mentioned we generally need up to 1,500 hours simply hearing our target language for our brains to learn to parse the language well. So even if its background listening during the day, mixed with some show watching or stuff we focus on more intensely, more listening adds up and is helpful. I know lots of immersion/listening 'all the time' has been big in AJATT and Refold for a long while, it was just cool to stumble into another source explaining why it helps.", "created_utc": "1620402647.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gxaawsn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_n5tewa", "parent_id": "t1_gx9b5ub", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I've looked it up before - Duolingo teaches 3200 japanese words, and covers most of what is in N5 and N4 grammar. This is actually pretty decent vocabulary wise (assuming many of these are high frequency words that will benefit a person). The grammar taught isn't much better or worse than most apps I've seen - barely any apps really get into intermediate or above grammar unfortunately. \n\nWhat annoys me most about the apps I've looked into is their mostly only beginner vocabulary and grammar, and how its hard to find out they only cover that much - I'm trying to look up if Lingodeer covers more right now. But last time I checked, it only covered about the same grammar as Genki I and II (N5, some N4), and 2000-3000 words (some in supplementary sections not everyone completes). The benefit over Duolingo would then be that Lingodeer has more grammar explicitly explained and an organization I found more logical.\n\nIn the end, these kinds of apps had the same problems for me personally - I do think you can learn from them. IF you are a person who enjoys grinding, their slow pace, using them frequently, and continues to (some people have learned enough German or French to move into native materials after very heavy use of duolingo courses for 1-2 years). But the apps are limited - most people do not study the courses that comprehensively, and the courses themselves present information quite slowly. It is so much faster to study from most any well designed textbook for 1 hour and get 20-40 new vocabulary words, 1-5 new grammar points, some listening and reading practice and exercises (or anki and reading grammar guides, or plenty of other self-study plans). Versus duolingo or similar for 1-2 hours. \n\nI always gave up on using duolingo because I felt it took forever to 'study' a few words, a few points - and its also why I gave up Lingodeer. I need faster paced material or I give up and get frustrated. And then their other big drawback - these apps only cover beginner material. A good self-studier (or good class) will cover beginner material in a year, maybe 2. But after 1 year you'll probably know enough to also be challenging yourself with more intermediate things. Whereas apps like Duolingo - the way people use them - they will not get through that material in 1-2 years. Only the people who really Grind duolingo will (which is great if that is the only way they're motivated to grind, otherwise if they're that diligent about study another learning source may be faster for them). So most people will be stuck in the beginner learning for ages if they just use duolingo 15 minutes a day, or an hour every once in a while. And they might not know that even once they complete the entire course, they'll have only covered beginner material. Anki and memrise etc aren't perfect, but if someone grinds the same amount in them they'll probably cover more words in the same study time. I studied 600 words and several sections of grammar points in the last month on memrise doing it in my down time during the day, I have never gotten through 600 words in any duolingo course.\n\nIf they ARE a person who can use duolingo well (a grinder) then they need to be challenging themselves to branch out of duolingo eventually - the successful studiers I've seen did indeed add immersion in content and looking up words/looking up grammar on their own. And if they're a usual user - they will not cover enough beginner foundation for jumping into intermediate materials easily. Basically - even the grinding users will need outside resources for grammar/intermediate material. And the regular user? The slow rate at which the course progresses means it would probably serve better as practice translating/seeing words you already know/practice drilling correct grammar.

They tried to put it in, noticed something was odd. They figured out I had 2 ToT and talked to and soothed me for like an hour as I cried because I couldn't get an iud - which had been my last option. They were really nice and found a good specialist gynecologist to send me to.\n\nI went to the gynecologist, she had my kidneys checked to make sure nothing was wrong with them (a related thing that can sometimes occur), and checked that everything was okay. My doctor said she doesn't really know if 2 uteruses is why my periods hurt so much - but by some luck, I had unrelated stomach pain issues and was prescribed amytriptline because it can serve as a muscle relaxer for that kind of pain. And that medicine also happens to help my cramps (and helps lessen my intense mental health drop the week right before my period). So at least we had some solution for the awful pain - I usually take painkiller, and get in a hot bath, and take the amytriptyline if it still hurts so much I'm crying. She checked me for endometriosis and I don't have that, no cysts, in the years she's seen me. So she thinks my periods just happen to hurt really bad.\n\nFor birth control I ended up getting my tubes removed, since hormone bc just did not work with me. She helped me try a few more all with bad side effects - though the mini pill helped my period pain and had the least effects, so it might work for some people who are sensitive to hormones! Its just unfortunately the few side effects the mini pill gave me were still too bad to tolerate (mainly dizzy spells/seeing white often/numb limbs often). I do think my tubes removed made my period hurt a little less, but as far as I looked into it/asked my doctor, there's no pain-lessening benefit doctors are aware of so don't count on it. \n\nIt's kind of funny now looking back? Because I have a heart condition where my walls didn't fully form so there was a hole (I got surgery to fix it when I was 8), meanwhile my uterus has an extra wall lol. And my periods always hurt so awful, got so easily delayed by months just from stress, I'd feel much worse mental health wise the week before a period, bc pills always affected me really bad, I don't know if any of that relates to 2 uteruses but I always just assumed all that was just pretty normal. What I do wish, is that I knew more about what health issues to look out for because of it? \n\nMy doctor told me I'd have a higher risk of premature birth if I had a pregnancy, and that a pregnancy would need more monitoring, but she did not make it sound like a big deal (though in retrospect it scared me a bit, and I'm glad I don't plan to go through pregnancy since my heart condition makes pregnancy life threatening anyway). I remember she told me I had two everything, so sometimes sex could hurt and if that happens there's surgery to remove the wall so it doesn't hurt - or if it doesn't hurt, then the wall would just rip if I gave birth. Which sounds horrific in hindsight??? I would much rather have something fixed in surgery, then be in the middle of giving birth and feel part of me rip?? My doctor had mentioned it so nonchalantly like it was nothing. Thankfully again I can't have kids now, and sex doesn't hurt so I probably won't have to deal with it. I do think you should be able to talk to a doctor about surgery if sex hurts or you're planning to have kids, to get ahead of this situation instead of having to deal with pain though.\n\nI wonder if having two uteruses makes cysts or endometriosis more likely?

If I don't learn the word, I just keep looking it up until I do. Usually that takes 1-3 lookups for easier words, 15-20 for harder ones. If I wrote them down or reviewed them I think it would take less look ups. Also I pick up more words faster if I read often - daily, 1 chapter or more. When extensive reading, to work on reading speed/overall comprehension, I look up rarely - only if I feel I need to in order to understand (or a word bugs me), and I glance quickly at the definition and move on.

I just do not do well with srs flashcards. For the past year I've been picking up new words in reading - either intensively where I looked up words a few times until I remembered them, or extensively just knowing the hanzi already and figuring out what the new combo word meant in context. And in shows, looking words up occasionally or just figuring out meaning from context. Usually words I'd look up when intensive reading, would end up being words I'd already roughly guessed the meaning of in other immersion - or vice versa. So that's how I picked up most of my words. (The first 2000 words I learned with srs flashcards so it'd take a shorter amount of time of a few months, but after that I went into novel reading and repeated exposure/lookup for learning words).\n\nI've been trying to work more audio-focused immersion in, since I know my reading skill is significantly better. I listen to Chinese Spoonfed audio files regularly (audio only - helps but lots of words I already know), and watch shows (but the shows have a visual component so I can always follow most of it even without knowing all the words, and chinese shows usually have hard subs in chinese so the subs are always there to help me). Audio dramas and audiobooks give me the fastest amount of word exposure when listening (compared to shows) and more unknown words (Chinese Spoonfed I know most words I hear - though I can learn whatever new words it has quickly since everything's i+1, and shows when I don't know words have so much context its rarely enough of an issue that I end up noticing unknown words through listening). So I've been working with more audio-only resources to try and push up my listening skills to where my reading skills are - which is working out ok. \n\nI'm just wondering when my listening skills for audio only will be at a point that I can learn new words from the audio only - instead of needing to have read the word somewhere else first. With shows, comprehension only had to be around 'main plot fully grasped' comprehension wise when I could start picking up new words from watching shows. Novels I needed a bit more comprehension, if they were denser text, but I did not need 95% comprehension to start learning new words from reading only - even outside of word lookups, since I could follow the main plot I could start picking up some words in context (hanzi that combine to clearly understood words like doorway, little girl, little boy, train, traincar, steering wheel, etc). So even when I extensively read, I know I may learn some new words. \n\nBut with audio only, I'm not sure if people need higher base comprehension before they can start recognizing and figuring out totally new words from the context. Since audio only has no visual component to help with context like shows/manhua. And even novels have hanzi - so I can tell if it's hanzi I know that make up a word, can tell if a radical hints at meaning, can clearly see all the other words in the paragraph before and after etc.\n\nFor people who've developed listening skills, when do they reach a point where listening-only materials was enough for them to start picking up some words from context? \n\nI'm going to keep doing all my other stuff, I just think listening only as an activity I do sometimes will benefit me more once I can pick up some words from context. If its only reinforcing words I've learned from other sources, then I'll know its just a reinforcing activity, not one I can pick up new words from yet. I'm guessing listening hits a comprehension level where you can pick up new things from it alone, but I'm not sure what that comprehension level is compared to other activities. Like in Refold Levels of Comprehension, comics and shows you can learn words from context at level 3 'gist.' Reading novels you can pick up some new words from context at level 3 'gist,' but pick up words much quicker at level 4 'story' and above.

Mm I studied french before I found mia/Refold, but refold's kinda similar to what I did. \n\nI took one french beginner class - useful because the teacher taught basic pronunciation (mine was still pretty awful), our teacher taught us basic past/present/future tense (j'ai verb, je verb, je vais verb), and taught us the most common conjugation type verbs along with like 100 common ones (er verbs). The teacher also taught us some easy ways to spot cognates. This made reading easier later.\n\nI found some french books and ended up wanting to read them. So I looked up how to read. Articles said learn common words. I learned \"300 common words to say anything\" list on language blogs on tumblr - a nice little list to talk basically about any topic. It combined great with the basic tenses I knew. Then I looked up common word lists - found 2000 common french words website with the word, definition, example sentence. I would look at these lists, and read over them a few times a week. When parts were easy I'd just skip to reading new parts. (Nowadays, I'd have done 2000 words with some anki or memrise deck in a couple months - which is what I did with chinese).\n\n I looked up \"french grammar guide\" and found a website, just read through it. Like Refold - just reading through it and glancing, to get an overview. The guide had useful stuff like \"these are verb endings\" so I could recognize verbs in a sentence easier, \"this verb tense means past/command/future\" etc. \"these are adjective endings\" so I could recognize what's an adjective, \"le/la/une/un\" are in front of nouns so I can recognize what's a noun etc. Reading the grammar guide took a month tops, I just glanced at it a couple days a week I might've finished in less than a month. The class took 3-4 months, during the class I also glanced at the word lists and grammar guide. I also tried reading a little - websites for learners, little dialogues, wikipedia/news (barely understanding lol). \n \nClass ended. I kept trying to read - I wanted to read the french books I'd gotten! I started mainly with news, wikipedia, sites in french (changed google to french so sites often linked to french first). I would look up a handful of words or whatever I felt like - not all unknown words though, often I just tried to understand from context. My goal was stop looking up words as soon as I could comprehend enough to learn from only context. I'd mostly look up keywords (usually a noun in news/wikipedia is a proper name you can recognize, an adjective is not strictly necessary to figure out the main idea, but an unknown verb/place/noun/result might be). I moved into french learner books (like reading a psychology article in french, or an assimil book for japanese written in french). I would look up words when I wanted, try to understand from context, and maybe go back to the grammar guide I had read if I re-noticed a grammar point and it confused me. These months 3 - 6 reading was HARD like 50% comprehensible if I was lucky, my goal was enough to at LEAST understand the main idea (so that's what I prioritized when doing word lookup). I think not everyone wants to willingly try to read at this level of comprehension lol. \n\nMaybe 5-6 months in I stopped looking at the word list - I knew enough words I didn't need to reference it. Also stopped looking at the grammar guide. My google was in french, when I looked up words the first definition was in french so I got used to reading french-french definitions. I would not read that often - maybe 1-2 times a week, or daily in very small 5-10 minute doses since my google results/wikipedia/news articles always opened in french first and I was too lazy to go to the english versions. Reading comprehension from month 6-year 1 was better in that main idea I could often grasp, but everything was just slow incremental improvement.\n\nA year in I gave up looking up words - I was lazy, felt I could figure out most words in context alone now. At that point I looked up words as often as I look up unknown words in english. At 1.5 years in I felt my grammar understanding had weak spots. So I looked up a grammar guide for French written in French (it was called FLE something - I believe its for learners of French learning in French). I read through maybe B1-B2 level grammar in that guide. Took a month or 2 to read through in free time. Around that time I also discovered a book called Francais Par Le Methode Nature (free on archive.org - also I love this style of teaching in general, Lingva Latina is written in the same way). It was a textbook teaching French in only french, grammar and new vocab through story format (so no explanations or vocab lists), going from beginner to B1-B2 level so a learner could go from it to native reading material. I started reading it - read 300 pages. It probably helped consolidate what I knew, and fill in any 'common word/grammar' gaps I somehow still hadn't learned. I still wanna go back and finish that book, I loved it's concept.\n\nKept reading. More novels and history books now. Somewhere between year 1-2 I was able to read the french books I'd gotten from the thriftstore (written in 1930s I was curious of their perspective/views in that time period). After that, read more novels - news/wikipedia felt the same as reading english, novels still had challenging 'less comprehensible' feeling. Novels I understood main gist, but often each time I read I learned many new words in contexts, picked up on more details, comprehension kept improving. News/wikipedia etc were probably 90%+ comprehension, so enough I think most people would find it tolerable. And novels were 70-90% ish comprehensible depending largely on topic, page, paragraph, etc. As long as I understood main gist I kept reading. \n\nAfter year 2 - reading in novels had improved enough, I felt anything I wanted to read in french I could just pick up and read and comprehend enough to enjoy it to the degree I wanted. It stopped feeling like 'studying' to read (because I could comprehend enough it was no longer draining to pick up new words in context). I effectively stopped 'studying reading' and just read as desired for pleasure (so maybe once every few months novels, and daily my google is in French now). 2.5 years in I listened to Coffee Break French, Language Transfer French, Comprehensible Input French youtubes, to get SOME listening skills. And to improve my atrocious accent to something bearable. It must have helped a little, since I've talked to some french people since then and they said my accent was good/fine (which I'm shocked by considering I think its a miracle I can even hear nuance better now after those couple months training listening better). After that I stopped studying french - still read every 3-6 months a novel/history book when I feel like it. My google is still in french, at this point it feels the same as reading/navigating in english. When I pick up a novel though there's still significant new words - I certainly coast by with the help of cognates/grammar comprehension. I can catch most all details if I try, but if I'm reading without trying to guess new word meanings from context then I miss more details than I would in english. If I want to catch all details, I do sometimes have to stick with one novel a while (to get used to an author's vocab) or read slower the first few chapters (again to get used to the new word choices). Sort of like if you're used to reading modern mystery, then pick up a sci fi or historical novel. I still see improvements each time I read, faster/easier, like when you're in high school and each novel you read makes reading 'easier.' I'm reading Dracula right now and bafflingly feels so much like the first time I read it in english and struggled until I got used to it. \n\nLearning just to read was not really that different to normal approach I just skipped the other skills mostly? It helps French is similar to english in terms of grammar that 'clicks' pretty easy and huge amount of similar words. I just put all my time into reading. Learn some common words, read through a grammar guide a few times, and read while looking things up, then read extensively. (For chinese I did something similar but used memrise and anki to SPEED up the common words learning part, do more intensive reading to pick up new hanzi since I can't sound them out, immerse way more frequently, and in chinese I do actually work on the other main skills of listening/writing/speaking). If someone more effectively did this I think they'd see great progress in less than 2 years - I didn't use srs, didn't ever try to intensively read (which I think helps speed up vocab), didn't use graded readers much (if extensively reading they're great to push up reading level quickly), did not do it daily.", "created_utc": "1620250836.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gx2t1vu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n5m29e", "parent_id": "t1_gx2kok8", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "What language are you studying?\n\nFor me I find studying both reinforce each other. I used to do more reading so I'd learn a ton of words through reading, but my listening skills lagged behind. But now that I do more listening too I have better listening skills and more often also learn the pronunciation of the words I pick up in reading. So for me reading is where I pick up a lot of new words, and doing listening too means I fully learn the word quicker (how it sounds too). \n\nWithout reading, I think I'd pick up vocab slower, just because reading I run into more words faster and there's nothing playing so I am more likely to look up new words (whereas listening I almost never look up unknown words since I don't like pausing). I would guess without reading, if the language is spelled somewhat like sound (or you see subtitles in shows), you'd probably pick up spelling of new words about as fast as you pick up new words in listening like you said.\n\nThey both train different skills comprehension wise too. Reading speed won't increase past a certain point unless you read more, and picking up the words some reading requires will happen faster if you read (he said, she shivered and stepped backward, descriptions, things that people don't tend to say much in audio dramas or shows). Listening only trains ability to understand immediately (reading you can take more time), to listen, to parse sounds etc things reading can't improve. Doing something like reading and audiobooks work well together, because you can pick up a lot of new words fast in reading while training reading skill, then listen and learn their pronunciation and train listening skill. Only doing one skill will mean a bit of imbalance. \n\nI studied french once just to read - it did not translate to listening at all. I studied pronunciation at first, a little, which helped barely. Then again after 2 years for a couple months - helped a bit more, still not much.

I can read their translation, and if i need to connect it to study time then it is \"making my life easier when I try to intensively/extensively read the novel later in the target language\" since its giving me context. And of course its also showing me IF I like the thing - reading the english translations, watching things with english subs, show me if I'll like it enough to want to invest time into understanding it in the target language without translation. Like... not all chinese novels I feel the need to read in chinese - but some of my favorites have not-perfect translations, and that motivates me to do more to read them in chinese. And some have excellent translations - which makes me love a new author, and want to learn to be able to read more of their stuff that has no translation yet (or to see what's changed - since my print chinese novels often have extra scenes the translations do not).\n\nWith japanese, I've just gotten back into studying. I got back into it, of all things, because I played a new video game by a storyteller I love and its originally in japanese - and it reminded me how Much I want to eventually play my favorite games in their original language before localization changes. That got me motivated to start studying again. And I found a japanese play I'd wanted to watch forever (Dracula Musical with a woman as dracula), and it was only in japanese so hey I tried to watch. It was both enjoyable and reminded me I want to learn more to understand better. It also showed me a whole world of japanese plays I didn't know of, but interest me! Now I've found more with english subs I can enjoy, and find troupes and plays I like through.  \n\nSo those are some ways I engage with more complex content that helps me discover what I like - some is just trying out harder content (even if its intensive study sessions or only partially understood while chilling and immersing), and some is just stuff in the language with english subs/translations (which is probably how I got into learning the language to begin with). Or talking to people on language exchange apps, and friends - hearing their favorite things, so going and exploring their favorites (whether in the language or using an english translation). \n\nIn a way I think... you can reinforce your love of a language, by enjoying things connected to it in your own native language (translated books, games, food recipes, reading about international politics, reading/listening about general sociology topics that interest you, even something as simple as reading Sherlock Holmes because the chinese dramas you got into are mystery shows with the same framework and you want to know what the heck they're referencing lol). And when you do that, you find general things you might like (japanese made me realize I love drawing character concept art, japanese made me realize I can actually enjoy plays/theatre, french made me realize I love reading about history in general, chinese made me realize I love certain writing styles/genre meshes and want to learn how to do them more in my own writing and in any stories I engage with). And its sort of like - language learning can help you find more things you're passionate about, and learning a language can just be a 'side effect' because you wanted to engage with those things more and needed the language to do so in the ways you wanted to sometimes. \n\nLike. How I started learning Chinese? I was just enjoying cdramas - I'd never watched one before, so it was just a \"new show I got recommended.\" It turned out to be exactly what I love. So I got curious, started learning chinese for fun. My show ended, I realized it had a novel with more plot/changes - I wanted to read it. Only half of it was translated, and the translation was not great. Guess who started learning to read chinese? I started trying to read it from like month 3 (very badly i could recognize numbers and 'hello'). But that's the catalyst that got me studying and setting goals, and I kept trying to read that novel lol (which finally I can read NOW after years ToT). On the way, I found that author's other novels - some translated really beautifully (which got me interested in the translation process and talking to people who translate). I found more shows I like, more novels. I learned how censorship laws affects cdramas versus novels,  how taiwan dramas/novels differ, started learning more broad things outside of just 'stories I liked.' It led to me making friends, finding new hobbies and interests, and becoming more curious about new things. Now I learn for much more than just to read the novel I wanted to originally aha. So I feel like, sometimes passions and language learning can just criss cross. Follow your curiosity. \n\nIts like enjoying art - sometimes you learn to draw because no one will draw it like it looks in your mind, but also you still enjoy just looking at art/finding new styles, reading comics/watching movies/seeing games and seeing all the ways art is used/manifests. You don't spend every 'art' activity learning drawing, you also spend time exploring art and the things it branches off into. It keeps you passionately wanting to draw, wanting to set new drawing goals, learn new things, and appreciate. \n\nBut also? Just consciously make time for hobbies IN your native language. Scale back language study a little, so you have time for your other hobbies. Sometimes I feel guilty for the reason you mentioned too - but also, I realize I don't want to be someone who's 'productive' all the time. Sometimes I want to do silly stuff only because its fun. Going for a walk or swim just because its fun, and pretty outside. Painting a fan because I want to try a new 'look' out. Reading a book I've heard is great but haven't had time for, writing a story just because its in my head.

The talking/writing is what's helping my active vocabulary come back. But I forgot some grammar when writing.\n\nFor keeping your progress in another language though - like keeping your German where its at right now so it doesn't deteriorate - just try to do things with it regularly in each skill. So once every few days (at least once a week), write and speak in it, read and listen in it. Ideally, if your study plan isn't that big for German - you could even just scale back time spent on German per day. So if you normally read 1 hour, listen 1/2 hour, write/speak twice a week - then scale it down to half the time for each. That will stall progress (or stop it depending on how little its cut down), but it will mostly keep all skills where they are currently so they won't be lost. Then you can add as much time as needed for French. \n\nIf German is your Main Priority - then keep German study time the same so you'll keep making progress (or do not shorten it very much). Then for French, add small bits of French activities to get back what you used to know - if you still remember reading/listening pretty well, then you'll probably want to put time into writing/speaking and looking up words you forgot how to say. \n\nFor me, the languages might get mixed up the first few times - but within a short time French will come out separate from German again.

Because its super easy on a language exchange app to - just talk your native language only, to repeatedly have basic convos (hi/what do you do for work? what's your major? how's your city? what's up) so you never need more than a basic tourist amount of communication skills, and to just never speak (only type messages). So to actually be immersed in the target language and use it in challenging ways that expand your skills, would require purposely planning to challenge yourself and finding ways to. Also - asking people what the word for X is a lot/using the in-app translator (if they didn't even plan to use a dictionary app), so you can pick up new words faster then guessing. I've used HelloTalk, Tandem, and an actual social media Weibo makes me regularly read/type chinese a lot more and learn new things than the language exchange apps (but language exchange are easier for me to find people to immediately chat with/ask questions and ask for corrections and generally be more open about 'we both are learning and willing to chat'). \n\nAlso, in general I'd recommend they probably did more besides hellotalk and anki - like watch shows, read, listen to stuff.

But if they were really only using hellotalk and anki and nothing else, I guess they wouldn't do this. A language exchange app on its own is not really an immersive environment, there's usually tons of stuff in your native language and people willing to talk in your native language and its easy to avoid using the language you're studying entirely - whereas shows, books, target language websites, everything is IN the language you study and there's less easy ways to just 'fall back' on your native language constantly.", "created_utc": "1620241012.0", "edited": "1620241350.0", "id": "gx25nkm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n5iqcz", "parent_id": "t3_n5iqcz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm glad you don't get scared to do it! Aha I think it's always been a combo of me used to language classes in school where even after years of prep, we barely tried real target language content (so it always felt hard, I assumed it would just always be hard and take years to feel remotely doable). And also I remember when I took japanese, and self studied later for a while, both teachers and some in the forums would hammer home how 'difficult' japanese is and how it will take years to understand anything. So when I studied I just assumed it would be too hard to even attempt - which held me back so much. \n\nWith chinese, which I've been studying the past 2 years, I never had as much of a mental block because I remembered a person in my life who had made it very much 'not seem harder than anything else.' He just treated it like any language, and that helped me not feel intimidated I suppose. I also remember, when I'd browse forums some people would insist chinese would be impossible to read until past HSK 6, others said they learned 2000 words and just started trying to read with a dictionary - so I followed the latter advice. Which worked well for me, and I'm glad I didn't wait even longer before trying. When I actually do try to read/listen etc, I make much better goals and make better study plans to make improvements in areas I'm focusing on. I think my chinese would be nowhere close to where it is now if I'd held off on trying to do things out of fear - and in some ways its better than I expected it to be. So I'm just learning to try and take that mindset back to japanese now, finally lol.\n\nYou're right in that there's nothing to really fear! But if someone's used to hearing \"that will be too hard\" sometimes they don't even try, to see how hard is actually is and which parts, and to see which parts they actually have made improvements in, and to actually practice part of the work of 'making it easier.' Because part of that is genuinely just practicing comprehending things you've studied, which takes immersion time. Also I think sometimes when people feel things as difficult they get discouraged, and that can make them feel afraid they haven't made the progress they wanted to. \n\nIts a double edged sword - if they actually do try, they see what progress they've actually made and that can help set realistic expectations. And no matter how many months/years you prepare, the initial hurdle of getting into target language content feels more 'difficult' than ideal. At least, it felt hard whether I tried within months for chinese, or after 2 years for japanese. So how long I waited and 'prepared' didn't really stop the difficulty curve for being daunting. But I kind of think, the sooner you get used to the difficulty curve and just trying, the sooner it stops being intimidating and just becomes fun and exciting as you see improvements.

Also like doing stuff you've read before (in english, or in L R before etc). Mm based on that I might keep doing stuff I have some prior context for, for a while. Like right now the novel I'm doing I've read a translation for in english, so maybe the prior context is helping me with word pickup. I wonder if doing some chapters over a few times would help. I do think where step 2 helps sometimes is visualizing what you've heard into 'words' and not just bigger phrases. At least that's a big thing I've noticed since I've been doing step 2 more/using parallel text. Whereas back when I was doing only step 3 with only english text, I think it helped my overall listening comprehension but I found it hard to pinpoint new words versus just hearing 'this bunch of words.' \n\nI used srs flashcards (memrise for 2000 common words, then chinese spoonfed deck maybe 500 cards) for a little while, a few months here and there, back when I learned the basics. So I didn't try L R until I knew some common words and was reading webnovel chapters intensively every few days. Idk if this would help you - I use audio files for the Chinese Spoonfed Deck a lot, even though I don't use srs flashcards a lot. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MCKgOxzW9cd1u9cWjzGwWrpxnL5pDz0w I started listening to these around the same time I started trying listening Reading more.

You would definitely have a perspective on how well or not L R Method works for picking up mandarin. Do you think it gave you any 'natural listening' ability for shows or easier novels than you usually L R? I think that was the L R Method's intent back when I read the articles on it - that after some hundred hours L R, one should be able to naturally listen to slightly easier things and be able to understand them mostly.

I think I learn more from the top down approach, in the sense I... do not like doing srs flashcards, or much formal study. But I do plan to do it when i feel its needed. So sometimes I try to make the immersion itself more 'graded' so more of it is my level of comprehension or just above, so its easier to learn from context. Its a way to make the immersion less demotivating when it starts feeling draining. And like you said - sometimes bottom-up study work also makes it less draining feeling/demotivating to immerse.\n\nAlso - depending on how much french you know right now? I remember when I was studying french to learn to read, I found a grammar guide in french and read that when I was intermediate. I'd read a grammar guide summary in english when I started (just reading through not memorizing). But then a year in with some reading skill, some things were unclear. So I found both easier immersion material (reading non-fiction like educational texts was easier for me than novels) and read more grammar explanation. \n\nI also started reading Francais Par Le Methode Nature back then - since its comprehensible input starting easy, gradually getting harder, and aiming to teach everything in context. To get a person from beginner into B1+ territory. It helped me immerse while also being in a much easier i+1 enviorment most of the time. (Here's the book link on archive.org: https://archive.org/details/jensen-arthur-le-francais-par-la-methode-nature , and here's the audio with text on youtube which I've lol been going over lately actually to improve my listening comprehension: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf8XN5kNFkhdIS7NMcdUdxibD1UyzNFTP ). It's an old material but I found it very useful and still do. \n\nAlso, using the Clozemaster app (its free) - it has sentences starting from most common words to less, to teach words in context. I found it was a very good mostly i+1 study material where I could learn new words without being overwhelmed in a novel with too much difficult material. Using Clozemaster for a while helped me push my comprehension up enough that novels stopped giving me so many sentences I found too difficult (I imagine using SRS flashcards would be similarly helpful, but I am too lazy to make my own cards and find my own sentences etc so I usually use premade when I do find srs flashcards necessary to speed up my progress faster as desired). \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is - while you may find more bottom-up approach studying makes immersion top-down study less draining, there's also a few ways to bridge the gap. You can sometimes make immersion material less difficult by adding subtitles/transcripts/finding graded materials/using click-dictionaries etc, and can browse bottom-up study materials for ones you like more (like I prefer audio flashcard 'files' and podcasts to boost my listening skills rather than srs flashcards, or video lessons/grammar summaries over textbooks depending on what grammar I need to understand). \n\nAlso for bottom-up approach study, you may find the book \"madrigal's magic key to french\" useful if you struggle to recognize cognates/meaning-implications in words. I have this book for spanish, have glanced at the french one and its a lot like a french teacher I once had used to show us.

When I asked you about your process, and progress - what I'm curious about is exactly what you do, and how many chapters in do you start noticing progress? As in you can start to understand the main idea of the audio without the translation, or phrases in the audio, etc. And how far in do you start noticing more improvement each time?\n\nI've been trying out L R Method a few different ways. I don't actually repeat L R with chapters I just go onto the next one. What I'm hoping is that, at least right now since I'm sticking to one novel, the author's general 'common words' I will pick up if I just keep going through the book. Then, if I get through a decent amount of the book and I want to repeat some sections (to pick up more vocabulary used mainly in those sections) I could. But for now just focus on the 'easy words/phrases' to pick up - the ones the author uses all the time.\n\nAnd I do not intensively read what I L R - although I do think it could help a lot! (I'm just lazy). I intensively read sometimes, but as its own activity with other novels. Recently, I've been working on my extensive reading skills - and I noticed that if I read a translation in english, then a chinese chapter, I can 'guess' enough unknown word's meanings just just read through it and follow most of it. So that's made extensive reading with harder texts much more doable (whereas without reading translation first my extensive reading level is around \u5c0f\u738b\u5b50 reading level). Well, when I extensive read (no matter how I do it), a big gap is I have no idea how the new words I 'figure out in context' are pronounced. Intensive reading doesn't have this issue - because in pleco I can click words and hear their pronunciation. But I need to do extensive reading specifically to build overall comprehension without a dictionary, and increase reading speed (intensive reading is just always slower since I have to pause to look things up).\n\nSo I've been trying to use Listening Reading Method again to help with those weak areas - my slow extensive reading speed (and reading extensively stuff I have Not already seen translations of), and my poor listening skills. It's actually been working super well? I notice step 2 is super useful for me learning the listening pronunciation of words I've 'guessed' during other extensive reading sessions, or that I've looked up before in intensive reading but forgot the pronunciation of. And now step 2 is starting to help learn New words a lot - when I do step 2 with new chapters, it forces me to 'extensively' read at the speed of the speaker so I have to read faster to catch the plot, and catch the word pronunciations. So I'm still guessing new word meanings in context, picking up new words, but I'm also getting pronunciation for them and being forced to 'read faster.' Then step 3 sort of serves a similar purpose to what I used to use Listening Reading Method for, and sort of what intensive reading does. I hear the audio and just see the english - and I can therefore 'look up' the meaning of anything I didn't understand in step 2 as I listen. And since I mainly only see english, I have to practice recognizing the words in listening. So new words picked up in step 3 I learn the pronunciation of - then next chapter's step 2 I might start noticing their spelling if I keep seeing them. And step 3 I practice listening-only of words I just knew I could recognize when reading in step 2. So its been really great so far for reinforcing both my extensive reading skills and listening only skills. I'm actually amazed. \n\nI mainly need the parallel text or Pleco with english-word-popups for step 3, because I think I just focus so much on NOT getting lost in step 3 if I can't glance at the chinese to make sure I know where in the audio I am. I've tried L R Method in the past with english-only text for step 3 and like half of my effort was just focused on keeping my place in the text, so I think I picked up new words slower. It still worked - and helped my listening comprehension a lot. But it felt so much more draining to do, because I had to pay attention to more than just sound+english. So for me i think that's the main benefit of me doing it with parallel texts or Pleco now for step 3. Also step 3 in pleco - the translation isn't literary (so not as useful for phrases), but since its word-by-word as the audio goes off I see exactly which definition is for which sound which makes it less hard compared to scanning the english text to match up to the chinese I hear. This could be a benefit or negative in the long run - and a benefit of parallel texts/english only over pleco is the literary translation I think is better for overall phrasings.\n\nBefore this, a few months ago, I tried L R Method where I only did step 3, only with english text. It helped a lot too - but back then I was primarily just gaining listening comprehension of words I knew. Like starting to recognize phrase blocks and their meaning - hearing stuff and understanding easier \"he shook his hand\" instead of just the individual words \"he\" \"grab\" \"le\" \"hand.\" So just doing step 3 months ago I noticed it immediately started improving my listening comprehension of words I knew in isolation so they started to have meaning together when I heard them, and picking up some new words/phrases slower. Back then, I noticed what it helped improve was my ability to recognize words as 'phrases' and when watching shows, to have a better ability to listen to dialogue without needing to rely on subtitles as constantly.\n\nThis time, doing it this new way with step 2 and 3 I'm noticing really drastic benefits though. I'm not sure if its because step 2 and step 3 are reinforcing each other, because using Pleco/parallel text frees up my attention to focus more on the listening and less on just staying in the right place in the text, or because last time I did L R Method months ago I improved comprehension of 'known words in reading' so now I have more free attention to start learning more new words. \n\nThis time doing L R Method, I'm noticing I am picking up more actual new words/phrases. I have done maybe 6-8 hours L R this past week. I just went and listened to a few of the chapters again without any text aid (a new chapter in the novel, and chapter 1 again). In both cases, I can now comprehend so much more when I listen without text. Now I can follow enough of the story and details in scenes to actually follow the story without the text. To hear actions/dialogues/interaction details as I listen to scenes. The hardest parts to listen to and comprehend now are the description heavy parts where no interaction with setting/another person is taking place - which is where probably the less common words are and the metaphors are heavier. Those parts I still hear a lot of unknown words. But parts where people talk and their topic of conversation, go to an area/do an action, feel a certain way, are all so much more comprehensible now. I can actually follow the plot just listening now! Which is so cool to me since I've never followed audiobooks this well on their own. \n\nI also tried to listen to a few other audiobooks as a test. Alice in wonderland I could follow fairly well, knowing the context ahead of time - which makes sense since it uses easier vocabulary (I could follow near every detail/word with images for context, but had to pay attention well to get overall plot/scene comprehension if I didn't see any context). I tried listening to Sherlock and I could follow a decent amount of the dialogue, some actions (he did X), but the description heavy setup (which i'm guessing contained the context) I only heard some phrases and keywords and could only vaguely guess what it might have been about. Which without context, made the Sherlock audiobook hard to tell what was going on outside of dialogue. Its still better listening comprehension then I've ever had for totally new audio only.\n\nMonths ago I tried to follow this audiobook without any text aid, I literally only could follow a few keywords and dialogue enough to follow some gist, mostly just isolated words/phrases I got but not in context, and relied on myself knowing the rough plot to guess what scene was happening. This time I could genuinely follow most of the scenes. I'm really excited to see what progress might be made in 10 more chapters! I'm really amazed its helped so much. I adore the book I'm reading, and its so nice to be able to chill and play the audiobook in the background while I work now and follow the story. I am really excited how many details might become easier to follow if I keep doing L R Method more with it. It didn't expect noticeable progress this fast.\n\nReading I've also noticed improvements - my ability to again 'recognize words in phrase blocks' is better when extensive reading now, I need less time to recognize word and phrase chunks. And I have already picked up a lot of this author's most often used ways of phrasing things, so some common adjectives and nouns and ways of describing actions have become easier for me to recognize when I read. The one thing L R Method does NOT give me time to do is recognize the hanzi-shape of what I'm seeing (since step 2 is so FAST and step 3 I see mainly english). So the hanzi shapes I glance at a little during next-chapter step 2's of words I've \"just learned\" but their hanzi-shape isn't sticking as fast. That's ok though, that just means new words I'm learning I'm learning first in listening then a bit later in reading recognition. Since step 2 makes me constantly see chinese with the audio, I am eventually picking up reading-recognition of the new words. I'm pretty happy with the reading skill help L R Method is giving me right now - last time I did L R method it seemed like it really just improved Listening skills (and I think that is its primary intention). But doing step 2 really does help boost up reading skills a bit too.", "created_utc": "1620149421.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gwxj9hn", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_n22sd4", "parent_id": "t1_gwx2yls", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Not immersing earlier - thinking it would be 'too hard.'

I once studied japanese for 2 years, and only after 2 years did I try to start reading manga (and barely understanding anything), and playing video games (and surprisingly capable of doing it even thouh it was hard). In half a year I improved so much, and I know doing more stuff in the language helped a ton. It also motivated me to study more (to make comprehension easier), and helped me make study plans that I could actually see if they were benefiting my goals/what I was trying to do or not and adjust as needed. Which resulted in much better study plans for myself that were eons better than the random things I'd been trying before that.\n\nIn retrospect I feel silly for not trying sooner - with French I tried reading immediately, and weekly, and pretty consistently engaged with French and as a result my reading skills got where I liked by 2 years. When I started studying Chinese, I decided that the mentality of 'japanese is so hard so I can't try to do anything in it for a long time' was what had held me back so much in japanese. So I just tried to think to myself Chinese was as easy as any other language, and treat it like French. So like French, I tried to do stuff in it often and made study plans to suit those goals. It helped so much. \n\nThen I read advice to 'immerse even more' ended up helping too - because I was still unconciously a bit 'scared' to immerse often in chinese, thinking it was too hard. I was only reading once a month, trying to watch a show once a month for a dozen minutes etc. After that advice, I tried graded readers and then webnovels and manhua on a weekly basis (eventually worked up to daily), I tried shows on a daily basis (super rough at first but helped Immensely in a matter of months), and tried audio only stuff more like audiobooks and audio dramas which I'd been too scared to ever try to follow in a foreign language before. And every single time, the improvements I got were proof that me being scared had been slowing me down. And every time I was able to 'follow a main plot' and 'catch more details' it was exciting proof to me I was improving in a noticeable way. \n\nI'm grateful for having found that advice, and finally taking it. Because looking back, my fear of immersing in general because I thought 'it'd be too hard' always just ended up slowing me down. I'm finally picking up japanese again now that I have time, and I'm being less scared about it - which resulted in me watching a play with no subtitles and being amazed  I could follow the main plot (and loving it so much I'm now a fan of the troupe lol), and me trying to read japanese novels (which is slow going but more progress than I ever made before with japanese). I tried playing some games the other day, and while it was intensely challenging, I was really excited I could follow the plot and the heap of directions. And as expected, its motivated me to study more to help me comprehend more, and helped me figure out the weak areas I need to focus most on.

I was wondering if I could ask you - do you ever run into issues when audio doesn't start/end with the chapter text start ends? \n\nI've been doing more L R lately, and right now I'm noticing so much progress from less than a dozen chapters done of a novel right now. But my audio matches each chapter perfect - I switched from my print version of the novel (which had added sections so the chinese text didn't always match audio) to the webnovel version and its so much easier to do L R now. Also using actual parallel texts or always seeing the chinese text so I don't lose my place as easily has helped a lot. Someone made a tool called bidiread recently so making parallel texts to use is now much easier for me - https://jzohrab.github.io/bidiread/ . I also just... for months I've been trying to incorporate L R more, but the frustration of so many chinese audiobooks I listen to ending in random spots in chapters, combined with it being hard to see the chinese text and translation at once, was making the activity more draining than it needed to be. I wondered if audio not matching up to start/ends bugged anyone else lol! \n\nNow I've changed my setup, L R is much easier for me! I also wonder if now that chinese text is easier to see, the start/ends of audio may not cause me to feel exhausted as much. Lately I have been playing the audiobook (in ximalaya or youtube etc), and then in Pleco app's Reader section following along with the chinese for step 2 (clicking a word here and there if I want). Then for step 3, I click the 'dictate text' megaphone button in Pleco, and glance at the english popup definitions as I listen to the text read aloud - pausing to look words up more occasionally (audio in step 3 isn't as good as step 2 but i'm picking up so many words). Or using a parallel text I made or found online - following along the chinese text for step 2, and referencing the english for step 3.

I recently watched that cure dolly video too, and thought about how it was related to Refold, and maybe Krashen's idea of comprehensible input, and other methods I've tried over the years that worked for me/didn't. \n\nWith Refold, I always felt the SRS Flashcards/anki is the bottom up study - you study specific word definitions, possibly specific grammar points. You can use anki to learn grammar, to learn X common words, you can make anki cards for novels or shows to study them intensively (aka study any new aspect specifically). If some people read grammar guides, this to an extent is bottom-up by seeing how the structure of the language works (maybe more traditionally what we think of as bottom-up if they also do grammar exercises). With pronunciation, looking up guides is bottom up. So Refold has some bottom up - and I do think I've run into trouble before, when I've tried immersion with absolutely no bottom up. \n\nAnd immersion is the top down approach. We practice comprehending the main idea, the overall gist. This part helps with overall comprehension skills improving so much. And I think to a degree when you can manage to immerse in content with largely comprehensible input where you do get a lot of i+1 sentences, that is a very happy middle ground. Because you have enough sentences you can specifically apply what you learned to - see a new grammar point, or word, look it up, and build knowledge of it. Or guess it mostly correct from context and ultimately add it to the base of knowledge we know and can build from. \n\nNot Refold specific, but I do think the concept of adding bottom up studying to top down immersion can often help speed up progress. (And failing to do top down immersion can of course slow down building comprehension skills). So like - doing some intensive reading where you look up most unknown words/some grammar as needed, compliments extensive reading very well. You build your bottom up comprehension each time you intensive read, then during immersion you build overall comprehension skills and practice also relying on those bottom-up things you studied. Listening to an audiobook with a transcript sometimes - to check words you know, link words to their correct pronunciation (if you didn't know it), helps with top-down listening only audiobooks later so you consolidate that specific study you did with a transcript.  Studying with anki words from immersion, or using audioflashcards where you explicitly have details explained (I like Chinese Spoonfed Audio files someone made, and japaneseaudiolessons.com), those tools go well with the general immersion to help clarify any parts that were vaguely understood during top-down. Or Shadowing - recording yourself, to play back and compare to the example audio and specifically notice what mistakes you make and what sounds you need to work on, listening/reading pronunciation guides to explicitly learn some things, goes well with general shadowing. \n\nFor me, I know that sometimes when my study isn't as effective as I want it to be, its because I realize if I add the approach I'm missing - top down or bottom up - it will help. I've been doing a ton of reading lately, and my vocab was increasing a lot from 'intensive' reading where I looked up every unknown words - it helped my overall comprehension when I went to read other novels, but my reading speed was awful. So I shifted to add more extensive reading time into my study - the improvements in overall comprehension are already noticeable, and reading speed I shaved off 1.5 minutes a chapter just extensive reading through one short 90 page book. Clearly what I was lacking was top down study. \n\nWhat you're worried about - that Refold won't have enough bottom-up approach studying for you: if you do a lot of SRS flashcards, I think you'll be fine. I think the SRS Flashcards are mostly bottom-up approach studying since its specific and explicit (this is X definition, this is X grammar that serves Y function, this is X pronunciation of Y text). Some more bottom-up approach resources could help though if you wanted. For me I think they expand the base-knowledge I know Well, so that I run into i+1 input easier (which is easier to learn quickly using top-down immersion). Things like looking up grammar guides and watching/reading through, or reading just a point you're curious about (I once combined this with immersion by reading a grammar guide in French for French once my reading skill was decent enough), like looking up words explicitly when immersing (you decide how frequent from once every several minutes, to full on intense reading where you look up every unknown). Even just adding audio to reading occasionally (if your listening knowledge is better), or adding transcript to audio occasionally (if you can read more words than listen and recognize). \n\nYour questions: \n\n1. I think Refold actually has some bottom-up built in (SRS to me is explicit vocab/grammar study its just usually based on clear examples rather than textbooks, is self-made and self-directed more often than textbooks/courses are - although there are premade SRS decks which exist, for example I use Nukemarine's LLJ courses for japanese and in a lot of ways it feels as structured to me as a textbook and makes me do 'exercises' aka the flashcards). I do not follow Refold strictly (for one I hate doing flashcards so I have to come up with alternatives sometimes - like glancing through a grammar guide, or intensive reading more often). I also think regardless of one's study approach (like say someone loves using textbook courses), if they do a lot of bottom-up approach they can benefit greatly just by adding some top-down activities. Regardless of how I learned my basics, immersion is always what helped turn 'stuff I understood' into overall comprehension skills that eventually broadened enough to start learning from context. I think even someone in a traditional course could adopt immersion to help comprehension. \n\n2. I do about as much bottom-up approach study as Refold suggests, just because I generally find that much is my sweet spot. Refold suggests glancing through a grammar guide when you start, a pronunciation guide, learning common words, then looking up some grammar points explicitly as curious. I also think SRS flashcards are kind of bottom-up study depending on how you do them. So to me, Refold in general seems to recommend explicit study for a while - just without Outputting by doing specific exercises early on, and often by making your own resources and picking resources as desired rather than following a strict trajectory a course would put you on. That's generally always been my starting bottom-up approach study when I start a language, followed by immersion then a bit more bottom-up explicit study on specific things as needed (which for me is more SRS flashcards when needed, or Heisig's RTK or equivalent books as needed, tone pronunciation guides as needed, etc).", "created_utc": "1620057160.0", "edited": "1620057360.0", "id": "gwsng7g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_n35m7z", "parent_id": "t3_n35m7z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "the cat in the story is named \u7b11\u732b - smiling cat!

And korean has an easier 'writing system' but I have heard their grammar system is not easy depending on your native language. So about as hard as japanese in terms of lack of cognates, grammar. \n\nYou're not going to learn chinese but wow has japanese gotten easier for me since I stopped studying it, then came back knowing 2000 hanzi from chinese. That said - japanese kanji are their own beast. The hardest thing is the fact they often have multiple pronunciations depending on the word they spell. That can be hard if you tend to subvocalize words, need to match sound to words (I do). Chinese was much easier in this regard since most hanzi have 1 pronunciation, and often one radical (part) of the hanzi hints at pronunciation (so once you recognize it you can often guess part of its pronunciation - its very easy to match new hanzi to new word sounds). Japanese kanji multiple pronunciations have always been the hardest part to me. That said, I still want to learn the language! Whenever I study it, it takes me 4x longer to learn to a level in japanese compared to the same level in french. But 4x more time is not super unexpected, and language learning is a many year process.\n\nJapanese is not as bad as people imagine it is though. The grammar is straightforward, if quite different than english. The pronunciation is clear. The kanji are actually great for understanding reading material in the long run (distinguish between words that sound the same, to guess meaning of new words), it is just remembering their different pronunciations. Which is not too challenging if you just learn them as you learn them within the spelling of words, in context.\n\nLearning kanji's meaning (so not the pronunciation part) is not as hard as it seems. We learn 2000 words in a language, then many many more! 2000 kanji 'meanings' is not really so much. There's books to help with learning meaning, flashcards, and a decent portion of people learn them over 3-6 months. I took a much slower approach, but even 500 kanji a year is quite doable and not too slow. And you can learn thousands of words Before you learn all the kanji, so not knowing them all will not hold you back for a while.

I only used a hanzi reference book for the first 800. Now I think hanzi were easier to learn (because I need a sound component to remember things).

Then when I move onto a new skill goal like speaking - I've picked up words from reading, and have better overall listening comprehension of them, so I can primarily just focus on USING words I learned and improving my pronunciation. \n\nIts like I build a foundation in one skill, and that will later be something I can rely on when I build the next skill up a bit. Then I just keep repeating that. This past month I did writing and reading, and now I'm doing reading and listening and notice I recognize more hanzi when I read (the writing last month helped) and when I listen I have an easier time recognizing familiar words (the reading from last month helped). \n\nWith a textbook, I don't think splitting skill goals is necessary as much - since good textbooks cover all 4 skills usually together. But when self studying, I find I do much better just focusing on 1-2 skills goals per time span. With french, I did an extreme version of that - all french reading, then french reading and grammar, then speaking/listening. It also worked well (although I think I should've done it the opposite order lol). By the time I got to speaking/listening, I had a huge vocabulary and a good grasp of sentence structure and all the words I heard were 'sort of' familiar, so I only really had to practice pronouncing better and recognizing audio words I already knew in written form. In general I try to practice all skills generally regularly (so a little listening, reading, speaking, writing within each month). But focusing on just 1-2 goals each month makes my progress build better off each other. Which again... I think helps moreso because I'm self studying, its motivating, and simple to follow. A better organized self-studier or someone with a more structured course I don't think would find as much value in doing it this way.", "created_utc": "1619200437.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvlbcbt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mwrawm", "parent_id": "t3_mwrawm", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Studying requires time - if you only have 2 hours a day, its what you have. How fast you make progress will be affected by that - just like if you studied using any method that long per day.\n\n15-30 minutes anki a day - use premade decks when possible to make anki take less time. If you make your own decks, then pick one day a week (maybe during the weekend) to make anki cards. 1 hour per day of anki if you're still doing kanji, to speed that up. 15-30 minutes youtube videos on grammar, or glancing through a tae kim grammar guide (if you're still doing that). The rest of the time is immersion. The days you have extra time, you can increase both or just increase immersion.\n\nAnd yes putting audio in the background whenever you can is a way to increase listening immersion. When you're cleaning the house, doing chores, walking, biking, riding passenger in a car, driving a car (just in the background like a radio you don't pay full attention to), exercising, cooking, eating. You must have meals during the day - that's listening time. Chores through the week - listening time. Traveling through the week - listening time. Literally any time you'd put something on in the background or hear silence if you didn't. \n\nAnd actually 10 minute breaks for anki would be great! I use memrise instead of anki, and I just do some 5-10 minute chunks of my japanese decks whenever I have down time. So at work as a small break, or during lunch once I'm done eating, or when watching shows/reading as quick breaks between shows/chapters. Anki/SRS flashcards are great for doing in small 5-30 minute bursts.\n\nAlso, don't necessarily get discouraged if you don't have much time. If japanese is important to you now, then you'll keep studying. If it turns out you don't have enough time to progress as fast as you want, you might wait to study it more until you can make more room in your schedule. When I started chinese, I only immersed maybe 1-3 times a week, for 20 minutes to an hour. I had some weeks, in between months of nothing, where I studied flashcards for an hour a day. I still made significant progress, and I'm really happy with how far I've come so far. I've improved much faster than I thought! Eventually, I was able to make 1-2 hours a day consistently to dedicate to chinese, but it didn't start out that way. Simply being consistent in studying each week, and immersing somewhat regularly, helped so much. If you want to improve as fast as Refold guide says - then yes you'll want to dedicate more time as soon as you can to studying.

I know to some people it seems obvious \"you will learn common words naturally.\" But for me it was never the case until I specifically read that advice. So I can't be the only person that advice may help. When I took german in school, our textbook and the rosetta stone our teacher had us do each week did not cover many common words apparently - because after 2 years we knew things like horse, monkey, field, but we had no idea how to have a conversation any deeper than \"Hello, how are you? I like cookies, I ran here.\" After two whole years I could maybe read a simple news article in german and guess a lot, or try to navigate a german info site like a university info page. \n\nIn french because I was prioritizing common words, I could do that in 3 months, then in 6 months I could read whatever I wanted with a dictionary to look up new words, and then in a year without a dictionary. So it made a huge difference. \n\nIt might seem like common sense to self learners used to making study plans - or with a good textbook. But sometimes its not. I had one chinese textbook that prioritized 1000 common words and its very useful, another that taught only 200 words and its main value was grammar explanation. In my spanish class, 2 years of german, and chinese class in high school we learned perhaps A1 level words (and in german random ones and more conjugation). But we never learned anything within my class time to do more than very basic travel conversation (where is my bag/my name is/i like/i want to order a burger/how much). In japanese the textbook I used does have reasonably common words (1700), but it takes 2 books or 4 semesters of study to learn that much. It genuinely wasn't until I started looking up common words myself, that I made any progress in japanese. Just like happened with french.\n\nThe german words make sense! Yes eventually words that suit your needs become more useful.", "created_utc": "1619182502.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvk7iwj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mw3m7t", "parent_id": "t1_gvjkc87", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "The side bar link \"how to start learning a language\" has some really solid advice.\n\nFigure out your goals - what do you want to do in the language? Specifically. Do you want to speak/write to people, about what? Read what stuff? Listen to what stuff? If you start a study plan and your method has nothing to do with your goal - maybe its a bad method for you. So find a method that has to do with what your goals. Want to read fiction novels? Then learning the x most common words, and maybe looking at a grammar guide, will teach you more faster than a tutor teaching you survival conversational everyday language. Want to talk to people? Then you need something to teach you pronunciation, you need a study plan that involves listening practice.\n\nIn general, you'll probably eventually have goals that require skills in listening, reading, speaking, writing. (Or in terms of study materials: something covering grammar, something expanding vocabulary, something practicing reading, practicing listening, practicing writing, practicing speaking).\n\nSo ultimately you'll want to pick a study method that you can learn all these things from - or Change your study plan later to add an additional method to learn one of the other skills. Like Rosetta Stone? Not perfect, but you could learn a thousand words with it - you still need grammar, reading practice, listening to convos, so find other methods to learn those.\n\nGood methods if you are bad at creating your own structure: pick a textbook you like. Ideally with a lot of common words (1000-2000 at least), a lot of the basic grammar (so you don't have to study grammar somewhere else), listening practice (it has dialogues and audio it comes with). Cheap ones include the Teach Yourself books - but some specific textbooks go best with certain languages. If you truly do everything a good textbook has to offer, it will make you practice all the skills. After a good textbook that covers the basics, get on a language exchange app (like Hellotalk, Tandem) and speak/write with people to practice that more. Watch/listen to/read stuff in the language to practice comprehension, looking up unknown words and grammar as desired. If you feel a need, then after a basic textbook find a more advanced textbook covering more information if you want.\n\nFree methods: find resources to study the 4 skills listening, reading, writing, speaking yourself. You may get lucky and find a free textbook equivalent - like the FSI courses, some BBC Language courses, some Coursera language courses. If you want to get your own chosen material: find a grammar guide (internet search \"language grammar guide\", a common word list \"language 2000 most common words\", or use an app like Memrise or Anki and search the same thing with one of those words added), listening practice (learning podcasts),  reading practice (graded readers, websites for \"easy language reading,\" reader tools where you can click for definitions as you read like some eReaders have/Google chrome has, many extensions can do this). Look up \"shadowing\" and do that for audio you listen to, in order to practice speaking. Look up reading/listening/watching material in your language once you feel you've learned enough to start trying to do that stuff (hint: you can start at 500 words if it makes you excited, or you can wait until 2000 words, but once you've completed a resource I really recommend starting to try this regularly to see where you're at and enjoy content in the language). Any of these resources can be cheap textbooks/library books/etc if you still want to use some paid materials. For practice writing - either follow course exercises, or eventually get on a language exchange app, or write journals etc.\n\nAn example for russian I did. Learn the alphabet and read a grammar guide overview (I liked this site http://www.russianlessons.net/lessons/lesson1_main.php). Russian Made Easy podcast for listening/shadowing (https://russianmadeeasy.com/), Russian Language in 25 Lessons by Artemiy Belyaev (grammar guide book with common words - alternatively there are free options I just like this book, https://www.amazon.com/Russian-language-25-lessons-English/dp/1523280948/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=russian+language+in+25+lessons&qid=1619132187&sr=8-2). I looked up \"russian most common words\" (I studied this list for vocabulary: http://masterrussian.com/vocabulary/most_common_words.htm, also this anki deck I just found if you like flashcard apps https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2037470492). That is listening, shadowing, grammar, vocabulary covered. I was learning Russian specifically with the goal to grasp the gist of what a friend, their roommates, their family I helped around the house etc, were talking about all the time. So I just needed basic conversational everyday stuff. My speaking/listening practice was also with them obviously. I never practiced writing as I didn't need it. I practiced some reading with free novels online I liked. It did not take too many months to be able to do what I needed to in Russian. If I had spent more time, I could've eventually made bigger goals. I think I used duolingo a little too, mainly just to practice writing since I had to text people it was nice to practice a little basics - but duolingo goes way too slow for me in general. Basically I just found resources to learn what I needed for my goal, and practice it. \n\nWhat has usually helped me personally is reading in a language - just because it really motivates me as a personal goal, I love reading stuff in its original language. I realized recently playing video games of all things in japanese motivates me - a friend learned mainly by playing them and looking up words in the language (after they learned the basics). And last time I studied japanese, doing the same thing was when I made the most improvement/motivation (along with other things i did like flashcards). So I think for me, its important to start using the language everyday in real life - to try to. It helps you figure out what you want to do, and why you find it hard to do it now, and what you might need to study to make it easier.\n\nAlso, I found this inspiring last time I was figuring out how to study a language. Someone who learned Russian described what they did: https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnRussian/comments/hys297/what_is_an_easy_way_to_learn_russian/fzf786a/", "created_utc": "1619132773.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvi4q7t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mw4yx2", "parent_id": "t3_mw4yx2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This resource is amazing!!!

I was in a class - our teacher was really good to be fair! She taught us simple past, present, future, 200 common verbs and their conjugations. So we could speak about a lot of stuff if we looked up the right key words. Well... without her, the book we used taught us stuff like \"classroom objects\" first. Then hobbies like \"art, swim, run.\" Which was fine, but for us adults classroom objects would rarely be useful once we left the class... we won't use 'semester' or 'test' much in conversations with strangers. But we weren't learning words in news, in novels we'd want to read, or to talk about our adult hobbies like video games/painting ceramics/rock climbing/making resin jewelry etc. The teacher helped a lot by providing us a lot of 'common' words the book didn't include for beginners - first I think that helped a LOT. you can say a LOT if you recognize a ton of common verbs, the word endings indicating a description (she taught us that and all the ones similar to english like intelligent 'ent' words), and can say past/present/future tense.\n\nBut what helped me on my own - I found a list called \"300 common words to say anything\" on tumblr. It was a list of words where you could communicate most any idea basically, and with a few looked up keywords, any idea at all on a general level. So with that list I could suddenly say \"I would love to work in a job where I get to go into the stars\" even if I didn't know the word astronaut. Or \"I hate working with numbers, I like doing stuff with people and emotions more\" if I don't know more specific words. It made such a difference! So few words and I could already start USING a language. That helped me also figure out what words I still needed to learn to talk specifically about What I wanted to talk about. Because then I had these basics to rely on and build upon already.\n\nI also looked up how to read, and remembered running into \"learn 2000 common words\" and you'll be able to understand like 80%+ of reading material, and 90%+ of daily conversations. So I tried. And it did help a lot - like you mentioned, I could now read a news article and if I didn't know the keyword it would usually be obvious in context so I could learn it Fast. Or if I needed to look up words, I only needed to look up some key words instead of tons of common words. I could quickly talk about more things - and again, just needing to look up key words in the areas I needed to go more in depth in. I think for me, common words provided a really nice foundation to build from. And they made immediately communicating, and comprehending the overall main idea gist, much more Achievable. Whereas I have seen some textbooks that only teach 200 words a volume... meaning its several semesters or years before you learn enough words to get a basis to at least follow the main context of what's going on (it was a chinese textbook with 200 words a volume).\n\nThere are plenty of people who recommend learning common words! Most articles for \"learning how to read\" to make efficient use of time, many \"common word\" anki and memrise decks, even the chinese HSK has a lot of common words it requires people to know which is helpful. I think some people dislike encouraging it though - because once you DO know 1000-2000 common words (or 5000, it really depends on the language), you start benefiting Faster from learning words IN the subjects you need to comprehend/communicate about. Like once you can get the overall main idea - less common words about computers are really useful if you have a tech job in that language. Or less common crime genre words if you read a lot of mystery novels, less common art words if you have an artistic hobby or read into art history in the language, etc. So once you hit a certain amount of common words, it does become valuable to study words YOU use instead of common ones. \n\nBut I also think, I'm glad I did see \"learn common words\" suggested to me. And I'm glad my french teacher valued that too. Because I literally NEVER learned how to do anything in a language I studied until I heard that advice. But once I followed it? It helped me quickly learn to read in french, learn to read and watch chinese and actually manage to follow along to an audiobook (things i thought would take many years instead of a couple). And with japanese I never followed this advice, i just learned from my textbook (which did have some common words, and some less common)... and it only taught me 500 words which was not enough on its own to jump into trying to read or watch japanese. It wasn't until I learned 1000+ words on my own in japanese, mostly common words, that I began to be able to learn vocabulary from actual reading and things (so finally more specialized-vocab I'd use, because I had the common words as a foundation). So I think common words can be very valuable to try to learn, at least as a beginner when they're most useful at quickly helping you increase the amount of things you can follow the gist of. And most good textbooks WILL eventually teach a lot of common words, if they're designed well. And even if a textbook is not great, if its grammar lessons are useful, common words can be learned on their own at a learner's personal study pace.\n\nWhen common words aren't always useful: again, once you learn a certain amount. For example in chinese - the HSK is a text to measure your fluency in chinese. Some HSK words are very common, but some are more because they think if a learner knows them they will be able to 'navigate tasks in the language better.' So some words are less common - but they are very useful if you actually need to do life tasks in chinese like go to school or work. And if you want to pass the test you NEED to learn them - so textbooks that teach even the less common HSK words are necessary. Likewise - HSK is not a perfect 'list to study from.' When reading even easier novels, sometimes 50% of a novel's words aren't in any of the HSK word lists. Not even the highest HSK word lists. So if you're learning to Read in chinese, learning words From your actual novels you read might teach you common words in novels much Faster than the HSK word lists at a certain point.", "created_utc": "1619121351.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvhf2du", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mw3m7t", "parent_id": "t3_mw3m7t", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "This advice! This is pretty much what I do. I set a few short term goals per month, and I also have a little list of 'general goals' where the only thing I have to do is like 5-15 minutes of them to add something to them. I will try to focus on the short term goals - but sometimes I end up wanting to do something unrelated. But tracking the 'general goals' progress each month keeps me motivated! And also helps me change my 'short term goals' when I realize for the past couple months I was reading focused (so maybe I will be able to get reading goals done, but should put off listening practice goals until later when I feel like it more).\n\nI have a note in my phone where I just add numbers spent doing something in the language as my general goals. Like \"chinese chapters read: 20\" and just whenever I pick up something to read and read for a sitting (like a few pages, or chapter), I add another number. Or \"shows watched,\" \"audio listened to,\" \"comics read,\" \"grammar sections read,\" and if I start one of those I mark it. It keeps me motivated because I see I was doing stuff, and helps me figure out if my goals were realistic. Like sometimes my goal for a month is \"read a short book\" but then I see all I did was watch shows - that's still great since I practiced. I might just decided though to do not-reading goals for a while until I can focus on reading. Just marking that I accomplish little things every day motivates me and keeps me studying. Ever since I started marking when I read a chapter, watched a video, listened to an audio, I started studying so much more regularly. Because they're not big, they're easy to do and I can choose what I feel like doing. And if I can't choose then I can look at my short term goals for the month that I thought I'd do lol.\n\nAlso I liked Memrise and Clozemaster. Memrise - because it used to show you flashcards in circle modules, and just seeing the circle fill up and be complete would motivate me when I did feel like using the app. I think they don't show it anymore, which is annoying since it helped ah. And Clozemaster shows \"percent of track finished\" and it goes up each time you study.

So I read the english translated chapter first - then later the chinese chapter. You could read the target language Right after reading the translation in your native language. But I usually wait a few days to a couple weeks, just because its easier for me to read 30 english chapters, then go back later and read 30 chinese ones. It helped me a ton! I couldn't believe how much even though it seems so obvious now and other people I know have done it. \n\nWhen I read the chinese chapter after having read the english translation, I find it very easy to guess most unknown words. I usually only end up with maybe 1 word a page now that I can't guess from context (usually brand new hanzi). So it doesn't hinder my understanding of the reading. So just having read the translation first, for context, made reading it in the target language much more achievable. My chinese novel also has additional scenes that weren't translated - so understanding the rest of the chapter so well, helps me pretty easily follow those new parts too. \n\nAnother thing I do with a much easier chinese book to read - I read the chinese chapter first. Sometimes I highlight any totally unknown words I couldn't guess from context or want to be sure of (or that are new hanzi), then afterward I flip to the english translation and skim through it to look up those words. So I read the target language first, then just reference my native language translation afterward to fill in gaps and match the meanings to the chinese parts I didn't understand. I've done this for french a lot too - I used to just read things in french and only  glance at english after I finished reading, to match up meaning for any words I couldn't figure out by the end of a chapter.\n\nA third way, which I read someone did (and I want to try). They would read the target language and try to get the gist of what was going on. Whenever they'd miss most of a paragraph's meaning, they'd look at their native language translation and just read that paragraph. Over time they had to look at their translation less and eventually not at all. So they read their target language paragraph by paragraph, and only looked at their translation when they couldn't overall follow a paragraph in the target language.\n\nNot quite a reading-only activity but you may also find the Listening Reading Method interesting. (http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm ) Look it up, as there's quite a lot of explanations on it. It requires target language text, translation text, audiobook in the target language. Its a cool way to use a translation as part of studying. It is more focused on building listening comprehension than reading skills though. The rough gist of it is step 1: read the translation, step 2: follow along the target language text while listening to the target language audio (getting a feel for language sounds, and listening to the end if you comprehend most of it), step 3: listen to the target language audio while glancing at the translation for meaning of words when you don't understand something you hear - focusing mainly on trying to comprehend the meaning of the audio. Then some people experimented with the method (like doing step 2 last - which I think helps more with reading comprehension).", "created_utc": "1619103351.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gvg882d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mvsavq", "parent_id": "t3_mvsavq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Language exchanges tend to help with active vocabulary - so talking to people on Hellotalk, Tandem, or getting an iTalki tutor to chat with regularly.

The guide will have the info you'll need as a beginner and especially for later on. That will have the most structure. Also maybe check out r/Korean. Other people using Refold for Korean specifically might post there.\n\n If you prefer structure? Refold might not be the only thing you want to do... I feel Refold is very self-directed so if you don't like figuring out what to use yourself in large part, it can be kind of hard. Textbooks/courses etc aren't perfect, but they tell you exactly what to do, when, and make you progress. That in combo with immersing - which you can look at Refold on effective ways to - can be pretty effective.\n\nWays to start Refold: \n\n- Find a common word anki deck (google \"korean common words\"), memrise course (look on the memrise website user made courses by just googling \"korean memrise course\" \"korean common words\" etc), or some other resource with common words. Ideally in sentences but pick whatever you like/can find. You'll want 1000-2000 to start. Start studying them daily. Anki or memrise are nice because they're SRS study systems so you can get reviews in a way which helps you remember. Also SRS would tell you exactly when to review. But even just a list of common words (or sentences with common words) you kept reviewing would work (Lingomastery has \"2000 Common Words in Language\" books which have example sentences like that). \n\n- Look up how to read hangul (if you haven't already). Find some article about it, read it. Should not take long. Maybe print out a guide or write a guide to reference if you want.\n\n- Look up \"korean pronunciation\" or \"korean pronunciation guide.\" You'll probably find an article, or youtube videos. Go through them just listening/getting used to recognizing. Should not take long.\n\n- Look up \"korean grammar guide.\" Or \"korean grammar\" on youtube. Find some korean grammar resource you like. Start reading it. You don't have to memorize, or do exercises, or even understand it all. You are just getting an overview of the grammar so you get used to seeing it. You might use a textbook or grammar book here if you like one and want to buy it/check it out in a library. (Japanese equivalent would be glancing through Tae Kim's Grammar Guide, or doing the Tango N5 example sentences SRS flashcards in anki). If you can find a \"korean grammar\" deck in Anki or memrise you might use that here. Just something to see some grammar. (I think the youtube channel \"Learn Korean in Korean\" is a cool way to learn hangul and grammar, and its all in Korean so you could also immerse a bit, but I'm not learning Korean so idk if you'll like it https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJhoF0nZwaVPSPNPIQhLmg )\n\nYou will have read through an explanation about hangul and pronunciation, are watching or reading or going through some flashcards with some grammar, are going through common words (ideally in sentences but if you can only find isolated words its fine). Once you finish glancing through the hangul, pronunciation, grammar, you will just continue doing SRS/common words.\n \nNow the other half: \n\n- pick immersion material. Try to immerse daily! So do some of the things above each day, and some immersion. Whatever you like in korean! \n\n- ideally some listening material (at first shows/videos with no subtitles, eventually maybe audiobooks or podcasts), and some reading material (at first show subtitles, comics, articles, eventually maybe webnovels and novels). But as long as you immerse in something, good job.\n\n- when you immerse, look up words occasionally when you're curious what they mean. Try to understand what you can from context. (You can look up words more often or less often as desired). Look up grammar as desired.\n\n- immerse in stuff that you're more familiar with if you want it to be easier at first (shows you've seen already, stories that are familiar, stuff that has more obvious context like comics versus novels etc). Immerse in stuff you enjoy (its easier to read a novel you love the show of already, than read news if you get bored by it). \n\n- Keep immersing as often as you can.\n\nEventually, you'll come to the point you run out of common words. At that point, you'll probably move into sentence mining (making your own sentence flashcards), or look up bigger sentence decks (for example chinese has an 8k sentence anki deck). You'll eventually find immersion gets easier and might spend a lot more time immersing and looking up stuff there etc. Also, you might notice, all Refold activities you could do WHILE going through a traditional course/book etc. So if you NEED structure, and Refold is hard for you to structure, you could do immersion alongside a different study plan. Or do immersion and SRS flashcards (like anki, memrise, etc) with other resources. Whatever gets you to KEEP studying and successfully make progress. \n\nSome general tips if you've been struggling to make progress (because I had that issue with japanese): \n\n- pick a study resource and go THROUGH it. Whatever it is (textbook, an anki/memrise deck of sentences, Clozemaster app, learning podcast, youtube lessons). Just keep going through it. I used to pick up a resource, then just go to another one, Re-learning beginner material over and over. So I never made much progress. With japanse I never made progress UNTIL I found a resource I'd keep working through without abandoning it (I use nukemarine's LLJ memrise courses in the order it says to - so I can follow the progression), and immersing regularly. So if you're prone to jumping between resources... just pick one and finish it. Then when you pick your next material, pick something the NEXT level of difficulty up. You can't make much progress unless you keep finding New things to learn, instead of repeating the same stuff. Immersion is helpful period, because all material in the target language will be 'difficult' for you so at least you'll always run into a new thing to learn. \n\n- Figure out your goals in the language. What do you want to do. If you want to read, and you've been studying daily life phrases, how much does that help you read? Sometimes we don't seem to make progress because we're studying something we don't use or need right now. Me studying classroom words in japanese is not helpful to me right now - I have zero need for classroom conversational language. But if my study resource had 4 chapters about 'classroom objects' and 'you have a test, where's the homework, can you read aloud?' then i would feel i haven't learned much (just because its not useful to me right now). If you use anki - learn things useful to you. For many people, common words are useful at first since they apply to most things. But eventually sentence mining is going to be more efficient, because it applies to people's specific needs. If you wanted to learn to watch crime shows, immersing in crime shows will sure help because you'll need more than daily life words to follow what's happening.

Michael Thomas would probably be similar (but costs more money since LT is free). MT I think if you get all the expansions, might have 1000-2000 common words, so that would be nice. You'll need a certain amount of common words and grammar to just 'get by' on the bare gist/basic communicating.\n\nWhen I was studying russian just to use it to talk to some people I needed to for daily life convos, I just got a nice Russian book that happened to have 2000 common words listed in the back (and in the lessons), and was just a grammar guide overview. I used that and some free language podcast to practice listening/speaking and it was enough to handle daily life household convos. \n\nThe pretty cheap Teach Yourself books are also usually pretty good for this - they have basic grammar, and usually 1000+ pretty common words. If you get one with audio, that would cover listening. Or you could use something free like Coffee Break Language for listening practice. \n\nAny resource with some audio to practice listening/copying, a couple thousand common words, and basic grammar would allow you to get by (not understand details, or speak perfectly, but like do basic things/follow basic things). I don't like Pimsleur on its own because it doesn't always cover a lot of words. You should check for the specific language you study (like I hear Michael Thomas is great but for Chinese it teaches some basics incorrectly which is a huge reason to Not use it for chinese). Free options are just looking up \"grammar guide,\" \"common words,\" \"language podcast\" for the language you're studying.", "created_utc": "1618935394.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gv7tg6v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_muhifa", "parent_id": "t3_muhifa", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Figure out what you want to do in the language. What is your long term goal to be able to do in the language? That's what will help you figure out short term what you need to study toward (to do smaller related goals), and long term what the end goal is (to do the full version of what you want to be able to do). \n\nIf you don't want to do anything with the language, you may not want to learn it and maybe you don't need to. No use wasting time on something you don't care about. And if you do want to do something in the language - maybe it will help you make a study plan so you don't waste time on stuff you don't want to. Like say you want to learn to read - you don't need to make yourself write grammar drills, its not needed to read, you don't need to practice speaking to people its not needed etc. Maybe later you'll want to speak to someone too - then you might make study goals related to that. \n\nDo you want to speak to people in the language - about what? Do you have a favorite book, game, movie made in the language and you want to understand it in its original form? Do you like webnovels and don't like that you have to wait for translations, sometimes they're never translated, sometimes they're translated bad - and just want to read them faster yourself? Do you run into the language daily and being able to speak about X topics in it would help you work with the people speaking it? Do you have a friend/family member who speaks a language and want to connect to them/understand them better? Do you want to work in X country, and need to do Y things in a language to do it? \n\nFigure out what you want or need to do in a language. That will help you make a study plan actually relevant to what you want to do, and so you can start practicing Doing it. First in smaller easier ways, then bigger ways until you can do your big goal. If its a goal, you want to do it right? So doing more things directly about your goal will make it more enjoyable and worth your time. \n\nYou want to read novels in a language? You can make goals based on improving reading (like getting familiar with X common words, studying grammar), read graded readers, comics, short articles first - enjoying that you CAN read earlier on, while working on reading better later. You want to speak to a friend/family member - start learning the words they're likely to use a lot, words in topics relevant to what you want to chat about, basic grammar, use listening practice resources. Start talking to the friend/family member (or a language exchange app first if you are scared to talk to them until you're better). \n\nYou want a job requiring the language - how do you need to use it? Learn that. I studied french a while back just because I wanted to read. Later, I needed to learn to speak/write to people better so I studied differently for that. Soon I might be applying for jobs in France, and I will probably do grammar exercises to work on my errors, since I can speak ok on daily topics enough to be understood and read fine, but don't want to have lots of errors when I speak in an interview/email. I want to improve my active vocabulary - so I'll probably talk in french more again, to get used to thinking in it/recalling words. I hate doing grammar exercises - but if I need to do it, to be more professional for a job, then I'll suck it up and do that part. At least the talking with friends part might be fun, and we could practice what I actually need to get better at talking about. \n\nYou don't have to study every single skill in a language at once if you don't have goals yet to use it in every way. If you're only motivated to read, or chat about your hobbies with people, go ahead and learn more of that first. You might find your wants/needs change over time. Usually, if you want to accomplish a goal a lot - then you'll be able to make yourself do the more boring parts. But if you don't care about a goal, or don't really need to do it, its a lot harder. Like... I never needed to study french listening/speaking/writing until I had french friends and just regularly got talked at/texted to, and needed to improve lol. I never needed to fix my grammar usage until I realized I might be applying for jobs. \n\nIf you happen to be studying for a class - so your only goal is a good grade/test result. Then try to think about other things you want to do in the language now and eventually. What sounds fun to you Now? What do you actually care about?\n\nWhen I was in french class I had 0 desire to talk about my day or work with anyone even though its what we were studying and tested on. Its only once I found french books I really liked and wanted to read, that I found a goal I cared about. In japanese, I knew I 'vaguely wanted' to learn and took a class but never learned much. Not until I realized I wanted to specifically play my favorite games, started just Trying to do it immediately, and realizing exactly what I needed to study to do That specifically better. \n\nSo - if you don't want to learn, I'd say just figure out what you want to do in the language. Then if you're studying stuff you actually Want to be able to do, it will hopefully be easier to do it. When you Still just don't feel like studying sometimes? Find something to do 15 minutes a day in the language (ideally goal related to motivate you, or just anything you like). Something that will keep the language 'studied a little' until you feel like studying a Lot again. \n\nFor chinese, sometimes it was just 'watch a show' with english subtitles because it would remind me how much I liked some, and wanted to not have to wait for subtitles lol. For japanese, I recently discovered musicals (which I'd never cared about before lol). But it was one I really ended up liking, a Dracula adaptation that was so cool - no subtitles so I just chilled and watched, and it reminded me how much one day I wanna watch it and understand more of it. I do not always feel like doing the hard parts of studying that I need for my goals lol. But just doing something related to what I want to do in the language, reminds me why I want to learn. So eventually I'll start studying again.", "created_utc": "1618934438.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gv7r78z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mure6t", "parent_id": "t1_gv7h3t9", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I think part of the reason is, its suited best to upper beginner/lower intermediate learners. \n\nThat's a great thing, because right there is when you need to build up enough vocabulary and practice with sentences to move into reading novels and big texts - and Clozemaster is perfect for that with single sentences with audio, with usually only 1 new word per sentence, to help you practice. But once you've learned a lot of common words, or don't struggle with sentence reading, usually just moving onto real novels helps more. If I don't know a word in one sentence, but I know the rest of the words in the paragraph, I can figure out the meaning from context. So at that point novels help me more with picking up new words.\n\nBut also Clozemaster is more useful with Some basis in a language - sometimes the sentence translations are 'meaning translations' but not direct translations, so you need to know most words in a sentence to realize that. Sometimes the sentences are wrong (which I don't think is a big deal since it gives so MANY practice sentences), but you need to have some basis in the language to catch these errors easily so you can ignore those sentences. Also if you're still an early beginner, usually the clozemaster sentences have Way more than 1 unknown thing in them - which can be overwhelming. Especially with languages like chinese and japanese.\n\nI think a lot of times when learning apps get mentioned on here, they mention the apps for new beginners. And Clozemaster I love specifically because it helps bridge the gap between \"you finished a beginner app like Duolingo or Lingodeer\" but \"you can't read actual novels yet.\" I love that there's an app that can fill that niche! When I was learning french, clozemaster helped me SO much with bridging the gap between being able to read graded readers versus real novels, without me having to struggle so much. But since new beginners won't find it as easy to use, I don't think its brought up as much. \n\nAlthough I have always wondered how well Clozemaster would work FOR a total beginner. Because in theory, I do think using just clozemaster could work as well as those methods I used to hear about of \"people sentence mining 10k sentences in the target language and studying.\" Except less work, since clozemaster already has the sentences premade. Yes, there'd still be errors that beginners wouldn't notice at first, but a lot of the 'premade' thousands of words sentence/word anki decks and memrise courses etc tend to have some mistakes too. I think with enough study you eventually realize those were mistakes anyway. Unfortunately I've never gotten to test this out myself. With french, once I used Clozemaster I already had a good foundation. With chinese, again I already had a good foundation and was just using it to help fill in my vocab and sentence-reading practice so I could go from graded readers to webnovels. With japanese I considered testing it, but realistically I have 2.5 years prior experience and most definitely already have a foundation - I already know Clozemaster would be more to help me learn the different kanji readings depending on the word (assuming there aren't to many errors with it), and bridge the gap from again simple-reading like manga into novel reading. \n\nClozemaster I think could be used by a complete beginners (just like any \"mine 10k sentences\" method has been), but for most beginners (like when I am) I think there's usually simply easier ways to get the basics down. Especially basic grammar - since Clozemaster doesn't explicitly explain any of it (even duolingo website sometimes has short grammar explanations, Lingodeer app Definitely has explanations, I read actual grammar guides as a beginner). Although for people who purely sentence mine, Clozemaster is about as fine a resource for a beginner (since a beginner might misunderstand or not notice a translation is incorrect sometimes, so there'd be occasional errors in the study material either way). But usually absolute beginners probably pick a tool that eases them in more - either because its slower, or it gives more explicit explanation, or both. So Clozemaster I think tends to suit people who already have the basics down better. And beginners are usually the ones asking for resources, so Clozemaster just maybe doesn't get suggested as much. \n\nI do wish Clozemaster and apps at its 'range' were brought up more though. Whenever I look for language learning apps, SO many just cover beginner material. So few get into upper beginner material, or intermediate material - when an app would be a GREAT bite size way to ease people into intermediate and help them push into using materials in their target language. There's graded readers, and there's Reader apps like LingQ, Beelingua, Pleco. I don't know if some of those are organized by \"common words first\" but Clozemaster I've always appreciated because it goes 'in an order.' I can start it knowing I know maybe 500-1000 words, and do it until I know a few thousand and knowing they're reasonably common words. Whereas when I used to try to use LingQ - not only did it cost more than I want to pay, but I would just click random words never knowing which would help me improve my overall comprehension % faster. At a certain point yeah, learning words in the topics you engage with is more beneficial to you. \n\nBut when you're still an upper beginner, you might have some huge gaps in common words depending on what you used to study as a beginner (like having a textbook that only covered 500 words, or learning from reading news so you only mostly learned those kinds of words etc which was my situation with French). Tools like Clozemaster help a lot for filling in gaps. For chinese, I eventually could move onto Pleco and look up words in stuff in webnovels I read. But even with chinese, I find usefulness with Clozemaster because I know a ton of 'murder mystery' words but lack a bunch of vocab about daily life and regular life discussions, which clozemaster goes through mostly for me since a lot are much more common words than 'what's common in the webnovels' I read. I use memrise sometimes, and in memrise I have to go onto the website to mark if I know words already in a course. In Clozemaster I can just click '100%' know when I run into a sentence with no new info (because I already learned it somewhere else), so its one of the easiest tools for me to go through things in order of most common to less, while still being able to very quickly skip anything I already know. Whereas anki and memrise I have to take out hours to look through an entire deck and mark everything I already know. My dream upper beginner/lower intermediate app would be some app like Lingodeer (but faster paced because I hate how slow Duolingo and Lingodeer cover material), with explicit grammar explanations into intermediate material. Because for a lot of upper beginners, there's some graded readers available (although sometimes not at ideal difficulties - which is where Clozemaster is nice since I can find sentence practice at all kinds of difficulty), some Reader apps (so you pick your own reading material), some premade sentence mining decks (memrise and anki). But there's not really any app I can think of that provides grammar explanation and exercises as you go through that level - just intermediate textbooks (if you find a good one your basics are a solid preparation for). Clozemaster fills in some of that gap by covering both very basic words (to fill in any gaps in basics you had), and covering roughly in order of common words (again filling in gaps and helping to bridge you into being able to understand things intermediate learners should comprehend). \n\nClozemaster has no grammar explanations though, so that's an area an app could really benefit people if it had. Textbooks and some courses fill that niche, but not really any apps. Lingodeer, as much as I love its concept... whenever I look I cannot find out how much Chinese II even teaches (generous estimate is up to HSK 4, which is NOT intermediate enough for learners to then move onto reading native materials with ease), and its Japanese course similarly is pretty much just beginner material.

If you like learning from videos, maybe search \"language comprehensible input\" on youtube. With 'language' as whatever language you're learning. I've found some really cool channels that way, even a korean one called \"Learn Korean in Korean\" which I managed to learn some basics from even though I barely study it/don't know hangul, just out of curiosity! So it was quite fun. And there's more in depth channels like: French Comprehensible Input, Dreaming Spanish, Alice Ayel. I even found a few for chinese and japanese last time I looked. I think those are really nice for either people who like learning from videos, or people like me who enjoy learning by doing in context - I mostly like just watching/reading things and picking up things from context so they suit me very well.\n\nI tend to like to learn by reading real novels and watching shows etc in the language I'm learning though. And that takes prep work first! So that I can comprehend enough to follow along with the main gist ideas at least in stuff I read/watch. So my usual prep for the basics of a language is: looking up \"language grammar guide\" and reading through it (or finding a nice grammar book I enjoy) - I just read through it so I see what I'm getting into and how it works, I don't try to memorize or understand everything I just read through it. Then later when I'm curious about a specific point I keep seeing, I might go look at the grammar guide again (or another one). I look up common words (or get a textbook with 1000-2000 common words, like the cheap Teach Yourself books even can be good for this), or find a memrise user-made flashcard course of common words (some people use anki), and just go through as many words as I can. \n\nAs soon as I feel like its bearable (a few months), I try to read graded readers or watch shows that seem simple (or shows I've seen before). Then I work my way up, giving up the memrise course etc as soon as I can (since I don't like flashcards lol) or using it only every few months as desired to speed up how many words I know. If you like flashcards, anki and memrise can be useful and maybe even fun! I like clozemaster once I'm not a beginner, because it has words in sentences and kind of feels like a game to me so it gets me to study sometimes. Also, while I think pimsleur does Not give learners enough words at all (you need to study a lot more on your own), I do think stuff like pimsleur, LanguageTransfer (free and I adore it), Coffee Break Language (free), all provide basic grammar explanation foundation if you prefer listening to lessons and getting to try conversations (instead of reading a grammar guide).\n\nMostly I just try to get a broad foundation when I'm learning the basics (go through a grammar guide or textbook with a lot of main grammar and just try to follow along, try to study a good basis of common words, then keep referencing grammar when needed as I see it happen in stuff I'm watching/reading). \n\nThen once I've got the basics down, I could do a lot of new stuff. Like go through more textbooks that go farther and actually do exercises if wanted, or do language exchanges to practice speaking/writing, or read more in depth with a dictionary, play video games in a language, listening reading method, etc. Whatever one likes to do and helps their own goals!", "created_utc": "1618929791.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gv7g61e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mure6t", "parent_id": "t3_mure6t", "score": "5", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I liked both apps!

There were some people ready to chat about bigger things, and chat regularly, but they were less common.\n\nWhereas Tandem, I have found most people I talk to are up to having regular conversations and conversations about topics more in depth.

I have Memrise app, and am specifically using a user-made set of courses -Nukemarines LLJ courses. They teach thousands of common words, grammar in some grammar guides, words in sentences and alone, and test me with audio and text for everything. So I can learn all the basic words and grammar to start reading/playing video games with a dictionary after this. The courses also recommend a free grammar guide to read as I go through it (Tae Kim's grammar guide). So there - a full course with everything I need to jump into reading/watching/playing in japanese with a dictionary being doable.

MOOCs for free structured lessons like a classroom that would teach you how to write/speak/read/listen. Free podcasts - Coffee Break 'Language', 'Language'pod101, etc just look up what learn Irish podcasts exist. Also of course textbooks if they include speaking drills - Pimsleur (audio only, most expensive), Assimil, Teach Yourself (usually quite cheap), more formal ones, etc.\n\nIf you want to learn to write:  HelloTalk, Tandem, for language partners. Duolingo - makes you translate so that could actually help with writing skills to a degree. Reading free grammar guides online (search 'learn irish' or 'irish grammar guide') any site with writing drills will help you practice. ANY app for writing exchanges/language partners.\n\nIf you want to learn to read: Memrise (look up courses in google 'irish' and then find user made courses there should be many different kinds), Clozemaster (learn words in sentence examples starting with the most common words), Anki (google courses people made for irish and see if you like any), Idiom app (a free reader app where you open up things in irish and click words for translated definitions as you read), any kindle/tablet/computer with a e-Reader will probably have a built in 'click for definition' function too (KyBook app does).\n\nListen: Podcasts - One Minute Irish, Bitesize Irish Podcast. Stuff like Pimsleur, just watching shows/consuming media with audio in irish and looking words up (youtube videos in irish, etc) - the extension \"Learn Languages with Youtube\" is free and sometimes lets you click words in subtitles and auto-translate but that will require subtitles. \n\nSummary: you could do JUST duolingo, memrise, anki, or clozemaster until you felt good enough at irish to do language exchanges and/or engage with irish content. You may find one of those apps/courses in those apps suits your goals better so you might want to check out a few. (Like duolingo is too slow for me, some memrise courses and anki decks are better than others, clozemaster is too hard for me when i'm a beginner, stuff like that).

When you read, make an effort to not glaze over sentences with words you don't understand - try to figure out what the sentence means overall, even if your brain wants to just skip the sentence. And try to figure out what the unknown words mean - some will be too hard to figure out, but some you might realize you can figure out from context. I definitely had issues with my brain skimming over parts I 'didn't understand at a glance'. While I think you could slowly pick up Really Obvious unknown words, it could maybe help to try to get your brain not to 'automatically skip' what's 'hard'. Sometimes what you're skipping isn't that hard at all (if it is, then you'll ultimately skip it anyway lol). Sometimes its just we're used to 'perfect' understanding so much that even just slightly less clear we glaze over (that we could probably still learn from/improve with pretty easy). Like, even if you only understand one new word or one new phrase in a sentence, that's a new things learned to add so in the future it won't be hard when it comes up. \n\nI feel like sometimes as I got more competent, there was a tendency to coast with what I know - if you're at a point you can understand the gist without help, you might be. You wouldn't 'need' to learn more to comprehend what you want to comprehend. When this happened to me, I just tried to stop skimming over sentences that looked hard - and realized I could understand a lot of them, I just hadn't been bothering. Some had more i+1 material so I kept picking more stuff up, etc. That's basically how my french reading's been ever since. The hard sentences just getting easier, the harder ones becoming comprehensible etc over time. But I just noticed because I kept trying over time.\n\nSentences like \"j'aime le [ ], c'est adorable\" - you see something 'adorable' would be a describer for in a show while this is said, you probably are already picking up that new word [ ] easily with immersion. But you'll often find you can have a more difficult sentence, and if you paused to make yourself look at it, you could probably figure it out too. Again, this is just sort of speeding up progress. As long as you are focusing on sentences with 1 unknown thing (like the example), and still picking those new things up, you are making progress.\n\nWhen I was learning to read french, at first I had no easy sentences so I never quite shared your experience of 'being able to just pay attention to the clear things' until I had improved a lot more. In the beginning, I focused on making myself read every sentence and guessing if things were nouns/verbs/adjectives based on word endings, if it was a news/history article then using what I knew about world events and the proper nouns to guess what some words meant etc. Then as I learned more, I got to where you are and I could skim read and get the main idea. So I kind of had to make myself stop skipping the harder parts and actually look at them and do what I used to do for everything. Also just upping my reading material difficulty (going from news articles to historical books, from graded readers to novels) so I had to try to get some of those other sentences if I wanted clear enough context to follow the main ideas. When I read I used to look words up in those 'unknown' sentences only if I couldn't figure out the main idea and key words without a dictionary - since I hate looking things up. So that might suit you if you don't like looking up words. \n\nFor chinese, I just use one study material where I do look up every unknown word. Because then somewhere I am making myself not skip hard sentences (and chinese is hard enough I'd rather quickly learn words correctly at this stage then guess on context - although when I read print books I just guess on context, I'm too lazy to look up words unless I'm using an eReader lol). \n\nIf you don't like trying to figure out the harder sentences - you will slowly pick up words anyway in super clear context cases where its very obvious what new unknown words mean. You could speed up that rate using materials really 'good' for your level like Graded Readers (where you can read them so easily you can basically just intuitively understand the meaning of the X-hundred new words a book has). You could watch shows in genres you know a lot of words for (like slice of life maybe?), and there will likely be more sentences per ep with just 1 unknown word that you can obviously understand from context. I don't know how much any of this helped... but basically just, you will make progress but depending on how fast you want things to go, you may want to either try put some focus on those 'harder' sentences you just tune out and see if you can pick some things up from context, or pick some graded materials to get some word exposure in a way you won't glaze over cause of difficulty changes (then just keep upping your vocab until its at a point you Can start more easily picking up things in those harder sentences and don't glaze over them).", "created_utc": "1617892720.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gttcijj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mmm0mq", "parent_id": "t3_mmm0mq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I don't immerse more than 2 hours a day on average. But I do notice quality of immersion tends to make the biggest difference. When I'm reading, and actively look up unknown words and try to break down new hanzi into their radicals to remember them, listen to their pronunciation, and listen to chunks of the text read aloud? I am practicing a lot more skills. I'm reading, learning more new vocab per minute (including their pronunciation and spelling), practicing listening after I read. Compared to when I'm just reading and looking up 'super unknown' words - however, extensive reading where I barely look up vocab or listen to audio helps me a lot with practicing reading speed, reading skill, handling ambiguity.\n\nOr watching tv - when I actively look up unknown words, I know I learn more vocabulary faster. When I actively try to shadow what some of them say, I practice my active listening more since I'm listening harder to the exact sounds. I think this is why anki/sentence mining is so often combined with immersion - sentence mining means you Must actively engage with the material more, which probably speeds up how much you acquire in a day. Versus simply immersing, where what you acquire may depend on how actively you engage - but immersing itself always builds the basic comprehending what you know already skills. I don't use flashcards much, so sometimes my immersing is just watching a show and guessing unknown words from context. I know its less effective - sometimes I miss tones, sometimes I catch a word but not the hanzi, i could be guessing the meaning of some words wrong. I'm not reviewing the words so I may have a harder time remembering them. But not stopping to look very much up, not stopping to make a card, means I am actively watching more episodes. There was a rough spot early on where I did do some flashcards, and looked up words much more often, until I was at the point I could watch and just get a decent number of words from context. \n\nI also think, for some people, premade decks or apps like Clozemaster are a middle ground trade off - no time spent sentence mining and distracting from immersion, but the material you review later may not be as relevant. Also, less push to actively engage with the immersion because you don't Have to make any sentence card. Hence you get situations like my immersion - sometimes I am actively looking up more unknown words, or thoroughly focusing on new hanzi to REALLY figure them out. But other times I 'vaguely get it' and move on, I just glance at new hanzi and don't put effort into remembering them. In these cases, I'm hoping exposure will teach me these words eventually... but exposure alone is probably going to go slower than if I was actively trying to learn and remember several new things when immersing. \n\nI think generally, more immersion is always helpful. So even passively listening to stuff half in the background, exposure and understanding some of the context (assuming you can comprehend SOME of the gist of what you listen to) will mean you will be picking things up over time. And immersion, period, is constantly training your ability to comprehend what you've learned. Which is a valuable skill, and stuff like reading speed/listening comprehension/instinctive understanding of grammar and phrases, all are helped a lot by more general immersion. But also, the amount of immersion that you actively spend trying to comprehend things and figure things out with focus i think is where a lot of quicker learning happens. That said, like others mentioned - its a balance between that and fatigue. If you get fatigued, you can't focus at all then the immersion isn't much help. So I can't focus as long when I constantly look things up, try to memorize hanzi etc - the tradeoff is half the time I use immersion material I can 'learn mostly from context' from. So I'm not always focusing as intensely, I can immerse longer, but some of the immersion I'm probably learning things slower or only partially until I see words more. That said, whenever I immerse I'm practicing those 'comprehension' skills so its still worth it.", "created_utc": "1617738715.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gtlvaqg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mk0nna", "parent_id": "t3_mk0nna", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Aha ToT didn't know I could think of that many until you asked lol!

Its a daomubiji/The Lost Tomb show - and I love those shows. The manhua itself is mostly just the main characters doing slice of life things as their tomb raiding shenanigans and 'acquaintances' bump into them. (Whereas the show is more horror/adventure/Indiana Jones vibes). Daomubiji also has english published translated novels called \"The Grave Digger Chronicles\" and all its chinese novels are online (though I also got the print versions), and they're pretty good novel reading practice if you like the horror action genre. Because they aren't written too complex. But yeah \u76d7\u5893\u7b14\u8bb0\u91cd\u542f\u6f2b\u753b was one of the first manhua I just read like crazy because it was easy and I was already into the show. Also on weibo, if you browse the tag 'manhua' you can find a ton of short manhua stories/comics to read. That's what I used to do.\n\n\u7834\u4e91 - another case of I've seen the book, so I found a manhua for it. The manhua is way easier to read - and very detective/crime genre, so easier if you're used to those genres. I usually watch detective shows so those genre words tend to be easier. Last time I saw it on bilibili.\n\n\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 - the cdrama The Untamed and the novel MoDaoZuShi/Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation are the other versions of this. The manhua is easier to read since its mostly dialogue, and if you are used to xianxia genre then not too hard (it was easier for me because I'd seen the show so I knew everyone's multiple names, titles). I did not read much of this manhua - I actually read more of it in french because I happened to find it in french first lol. But I've read a little, and I've seen a little of the print novel, and the manhua is a lot easier to read. \n\nSo mostly I just went with manhua adaptations of shows/novels I'd seen. They're bound to be easier just because I already had context. Popular shows/novels like The King's Avatar, Daomubiji, have manhua. The new cdrama The Long Ballad is based on an existing manhua.

Literally anything that gets you to engage in french every day, to study every day, is preferable to losing motivation enough that eventually you stop studying completely. Anything you do to study whether its Refold or something else, is going to work better than you giving up. Anything that makes you consistent and motivated is preferable to giving up!\n\nMay I suggest, if you enjoy immersing sometimes/in theory - try immersing in french grammar books/sites? I did this a lot back when I studied french. I did not know about Refold back then but I ended up doing something similar: I took one class, looked up a 5000 common words list and would glance at it every few days and read some, read a grammar guide online, tried to read the news/watch youtube I liked, and eventually when I immersed more I read french grammar explanations in french. I also read french textbooks on other stuff I was interested in, and french history stuff. I did not care at all about french shows at the time (though in retrospect I would've benefited from looking for good listening material I found fun sooner). I still made progress. I never used srs flashcards (thought they might've improved my speed of remembering words, and I agree with your idea that seeing 'cards learned' was motivating when I've used them for chinese). Also, you don't need to do immersion more than a half hour a day if it bugs you! Anything that lowers your desire to study doesn't help if it will make you give up. When I started, I read some french 30 minutes only every few days because I couldn't handle it everyday. And to be honest, yes immersion will always feel hard and draining at first. \n\nI think for me, to motivate me in immersion, I don't think about how much I don't understand. I use it to gauge progress: how much did I understand today. Cool, what do I understand now! What did I miss, can I study something to help with that? Then in a week or a month, make a note of how that immersion went and be excited about what I improved on and notice what I didn't. For chinese it was brutal at first, and all I noticed was picking up basic phrases, then just noticing I could go from tolerating 12 minutes to tolerating after Months finally a full episode with pausing a lot. Then months later a full episode with less pausing. Then months later being able to follow the plot without dictionary lookup. Like, immersion is hard to measure progress and I'm sure you've already noticed. But even if you study in a classroom or another way for years, to use the language ultimately you will be doing this same thing when you pick up a book or turn on a show so it will either have the difficulty curve then or now. You're just deciding when you're going to start practice the 'comprehending what you've studied' skills. How much you immerse is how much you decide to practice these skills now. I studied japanese once and didn't immerse for 2 years, so I hit this difficulty curve at year 2. In french and chinese I would challenge myself early, and also could handle shows and novels earlier because I'd practiced putting things I learned to practice earlier. While you do ultimately learn stuff in immersion (and with french I definitely did without srs flashcards), its once you are grasping enough context to pick up word/grammar meanings from context. You sound like you're already there, so you should notice you pick up more stuff actively in immersion alone then you did earlier on. And if you want to speed it up, look up words more often in immersion. In chinese one of the things I read regularly I look up all unknown words, and that's mainly how I pick up new words. In french that's what I used to do too, but eventually I felt I could figure out words from context and gave up looking up words in a dictionary completely. Also, I find if you're motivated by concrete progress - making monthly check ins of your progress and comprehension level helped me. Like: this is what I actively studied (srs flashcard numbers, or grammar guide chapters read, words looked up or chapters read/shows watched where u looked up words), this is how much I immersed (X chapters read, X articles, X episodes, X podcasts). So you can see roughly how much you did, and make your own notes on what you notice you are getting better at/where you want to improve and maybe how you plan to.\n\ntldr: you don't have to do Refold as its described if its demotivating you. If it makes you give up, it doesn't matter how effective it 'would've' been. Doing stuff that makes you keep studying french in Some Way no matter how much 'slower' progress might be will help you more if it gets you to consistently study. SRS Flashcards do help motivation (if you like them), counting immersion can help motivation (if you like the material you immerse in - you might want to switch materials to stuff that might be 'less ideal' but you enjoy more). Reading grammar is fine if it gets you to keep enjoying french. People have a ton of ways to learn a language and different ways work for different people, taking what in Refold helps you is great! But if doing the whole thing demotivates you to the point of giving up, then I hope you figure out the parts you don't like and change them for yourself.\n\nI can't find the grammar site I read through myself (it was in french, organized A1-B2, and labelled 'FLE'), but this site is another in all french where you can read about grammar: https://francais.lingolia.com/fr/grammaire\n\nYou could look up pretty much any topic you want to read about using french to search, like: B1 grammar, japanese grammar, psychology, news, history, mystery stories etc. And wikipedia of course but you likely know enough now already wikipedia may not be as interesting. Also, changing your google to french if you use it is an easy way to get more french exposure and be auto directed to french wikipedia, some sites in french, french definitions. \n\nEdit: I wanted to add about anki - I hate flashcards just cause I personally can rarely focus on them or be consistent. Word lists I've glanced at every several days helped, if I can't focus on flashcards (which is often). And I've often crunched through 200-1000 cards a week, for a few weeks, then ignored srs flashcards for months before going back. I still ended up retaining a lot of info, and I'm guessing its cause I still saw a lot of stuff from flashcards in immersion and just regular language exposure. Its not ideal, but you can be irregular and inconsistent with srs flashcards and they can STILL be helpful. Though if you're inconsistent like me, I personally try to minimize time on reviews when I go back unless I Really need it, because I tend to be a perfectionist and want to just relearn old stuff again. That holds me back when I usually retained most of it, so I try to always prioritize studying new stuff first when I go back to older study materials like grammar books or flashcards.

I took painkiller as directed by my doctor the first week then felt fine.  I took 4 days off of work. I was super excited after 2 weeks when I could go back to working out, my muscles didn't feel weaker! With the gallbladder removal, my abs were so weak it took months to get my muscle strength back.

Where did you find it to play? Did you need to get a ps1 for japanese?\n\nOk so, I wasted a lot of time in 2 years doing a lot of what you said - Genki, and jumping between resources. Learned barely anything. I eventually made some progress with Nukemarine's LLJ memrise decks (did 1/3) and immersing. The last 6 months I studied I did those decks, played KH2 in japanese looking up words sometimes, and tried to read manga looking up words. That was my fastest progress during all 2.5 years of study. Then I quit and now a couple years later I'm getting back to japanese.\n\nI wanted to respond about playing video games to learn! My friend learned japanese, and translates novels and visual novels. They told me how they learned and it inspired me: they learned for a year with Genki 1-2, mostly conversational so they only had to learn kana and 200 kanji unless motivated to do more. They learned around 1000 words. Then after that, they just started playing video games. They said they translated things as they played - so for visual novels tried to translate whole sentences etc. For games like Final Fantasy Type 0 they tried to follow everything they could and looked up words when they needed something for some kind of basic context. At first they didn't understand a LOT, but over time they learned this way. They also watched japanese lets plays, which often have japanese subtitles, and would pause to read/lookup words and translate as desired. They learned japanese this way. Their learning consisted of the first year Genki 1-2 in a class, then playing games and either trying to follow or translating or looking up a few words (depending on the day/game), watching lets plays (same process), or self translating novels/visual novels they were going through. So this worked for them, it could work for others. Mind you they used no flashcards or further vocab lists, grammar resources etc, so I think Refold method in some ways could speed up progress. I'm just saying what they did worked - so playing video games with some basic knowledge and looking up stuff, is a way to learn that works.\n\nA long time ago I wanted to learn japanese to play some of my favorite games in japanese before localization. So my friend sharing their process has really re-motivated me. I went back to Nukemarine's LLJ memrise decks because they worked so well for me years ago, am reading Tae Kim's guide (just glancing through since I did not even look at it last time), and watching lets plays in japanese. I watch a game I already have played so I can follow a ton from context and guess what they say, and I look up words whenever I'm curious. I'm going to keep doing this for a while. Then when I feel ready, I'd like to play Kingdom Hearts 2 and Nier Automata in japanese since they're two of my favorite games and I have both in japanese. In theory, I could just start now and like my friend look up words a lot as I played until I learned more. But I would like to know a bit more words first (I know maybe 1000 now too, but I'd like 2000 ToT before I jump in the deep end - at least lets plays I can pause and replay lines, I can't do that when playing lol).\n\nsummary: Yes its a fun way to learn! And playing a video game while either translating each word/line sometimes, and sometimes just looking up stuff every so often (so just trying to follow context), does work! It worked for my friend. And I've done a little of it, I found it really enjoyable if you like the game you're using. Only recommendation I'd really give is pick games you like over 'easy' games - its great if something is easy, but if you already know the game in english it will still be somewhat manageable to follow, and even if its brand new if you enjoy the game you'll keep immersing. Enjoyment will motivate you.\n\nRelated: you just inspired to me to look for if Ratchet and Clank is in japanese since I've played that so much - here's a movie version (with decent auto captions):https://youtu.be/QG7CsYg2n-s . There's also lets plays. This is the KH2 lets play I've been watching: https://youtu.be/_-tb7MuWeps . If you do want to play games in Japanese btw, if you live in America then you can buy Japanese ps3 games and they will work on American ps3 systems. That's how I play KH. I think ps4 games are the same. In Nier Automata's case, the American version of the game came with full japanese language options (I think Final Fantasy XV also did).", "created_utc": "1615996154.0", "edited": "1615997473.0", "id": "gr8xw64", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m7337k", "parent_id": "t3_m7337k", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Yes!

French I looked at some vocab lists I looked up and in class, and looked words up as I read. A ton of words were english cognates or similar, I could easily learn a ton in context. In Japanese I could have done the same for (and did for a while), it took 4 times longer to make the same progress milestones. Anki/memrise/srs flashcard apps just speed up the process a little. SRS flashcards are just a study/review method to try and speed up how long it takes to learn something. Since information is timed to be given to you to help put things into your long term memory as easily as possible. With French, I could've probably made even faster progress if I'd used srs flashcards/spaced review to learn stuff faster. But I don't like flashcards, and it was going fast enough for me I was happy. \n\nI think people use anki because it speeds up how long the words take to learn. And since japanese has less cognates with english, and grammar that is more different, the speed helps make progress feel like its going at a bearable pace. That's why I use memrise once in a while - to speed up the progress. I can learn some vocab faster than I could with a list or by looking stuff up, then read/immerse and the words are already familiar enough I pick them up way faster. With chinese I also used memrise on 3 different months, just to cram some vocab to speed along how long it was taking for me to go from graded readers to managing to read real novels. Now that I can read real novels, I don't feel the need to 'learn vocab faster' so I'm just learning as I look up words slower. But when I barely knew any hanzi, srs flashcards were super useful. Now that I know so many hanzi its much easier to look up new unknown words, and guess new chinese words since now I have 'related words' to figure them out. \u65b9\u5411\u76d8 means steering wheel, and has the words 'direction' 'plate' in it so its super easy to guess from context now that I know more base words. But before I'd learned a decent number of words, every single new word I had nothing even related to guess what it meant. In french I hardly needed any base words to guess tons of words since I could guess based on english. \n\nBasically, srs flashcards speed up basic memory of new things which helps speed up progress in learning the language.

I did Japanese alongside French, started 6 months after I started French. I studied japanese on/off for 2.5 years. Eventually my French got where I wanted it. My Japanese took 4 times longer to hit milestones which was demotivating (but expected). At 6 months in french I could read short stories/news and get the gist main idea, in 2.5 years of japanese I could barely read slice of life manga and follow the bare gist main idea without a dictionary. I also tried to study Spanish at some points, but never got far just because I wasn't motivated.\n\nI've realized for me I really need a concrete goal. In 2019 I wanted to start learning Chinese. I had a concrete goal - I watched my first cdrama ever and it was exactly my kind of story, and I found out it had a novel. A novel that was Not fully translated. So I wanted to be able to read it. Reading asap was the goal. Eventually I got broader goals - joined a language exchange app and wanted to learn to chat, started wanting to watch shows without subtitles when subs weren't available, wanting to follow audiobooks and audio dramas etc. But that first goal is what motivated me to keep studying. I guess I'm really motivated to read, and really willing to 'challenge myself' to hit the goal faster. I tried to read the goal novel at month 3 (horrific lol), found graded readers to MAKE myself read, at 6-8 months crammed a ton of vocab and made myself try easier chinese webnovels, and now at 1.5 years in I am reading my goal novel with a dictionary. I can read some easier novels without one (but this is a story I love so I want to know every word clearly lol). I can read my goal novel and get the main ideas and a decent amount of details without a dictionary (which I used to regularly try to do to test myself every couple months). I realize in retrospect, if I'd had a more concrete goal for Japanese, maybe I wouldn't have given up. \n\nFor French, my goal was just 'learn' and I floundered, until I found some 1930s books from a thrift store and desperately wanted to read them because I'm into history. That's what motivated me to start trying to read only months into learning French, and keeping reading, and by 1 year I could read those books and 2 years I could read whatever I wanted (so now when I see an interesting book in french I can just pick it up). When I started chinese, a lot of my study plan I based on french - in french I had never been afraid to dive right into the deep end and try to do what my goal was. So I tried to just do the same with chinese. It helps me goal set, but for me I think it also motivates a lot and pushes me to study what I need for my main goals asap.\n\nI'm just starting to pick back up Japanese thanks to a friend - who studied it years, translates, and reminded me of why I wanted to learn it once. They told me after they had classes of a year of basics (learned maybe 1000 words), they started playing japanese video games and just trying to follow/looking words up as they played. They'd watch lets plays in japanese to look up words ahead of time/see what the context is ahead of time etc. They also started translating visual novels (painstakingly slow lol) which is how they learned a lot more vocab and kanji. But it worked for them, considering where they are now! And it reminded me how in the beginning, I wanted to play my favorite video games in japanese before localization!\n\nI am restarting now as a false beginner, and I know at least 1000 words and had 2.5 years before (that I forgot lol). But in those 2.5 years, only the last half a year did I make faster progress. It was when I was trying to finally after 2 years try to read manga, twitter, and eventually right toward the end trying to play one of my fave games (which I somehow just barely was managing). So now that I'm restarting, I'm just diving in. Since that seems to motivate me way more. I'm watching lets plays and trying to read all the japanese subtitles (way more reading then i've EVER tried for japanese before lol), looking up a lot of words, and once I feel ready I'm going to try playing one like my friend did. I already tried when I was less prepared years ago lol, so I know it'll be manageable too this time. Also now that I Know my specific goal its easier for me to plan how to study. I'm studying a few thousand common words to fill in gaps and expand my base vocab, reading through a grammar guide that covers More than I studied the last time. I've already passed the stuff I studied in prior years (even though it's been months compared to years, I'm so much more motivated to cover more ground When studying now). I've done more listening practice this time around (compared to none last time lol).\n\nSo having a specific thing I want to try now in a language, and keep trying till I'm as good as I want, is a huge motivator. Also 'challenging myself to do what someone else did' lol. In chinese, I learned 2000 words in a couple months literally because I saw a guy's article he used X decks on memrise and read some grammar notes, then jumped into reading and it was manageable. And since I wanted to read asap, I copied what he did - it wasn't the most effective method lol but it worked. With Japanese, Nukemarine LLJ memrise decks I had been doing at year 2-2.5 whic had helped me progress. So now restarting, I am challenging myself to get further than I did last time (which lol I redid and surpassed my old self in a couple days... I am shocked past me did so little then tried to play video games). Now my goal is to finish them which I've never done. Then its to try to play a game and look up words like my friend did - they did it, so I want to try.", "created_utc": "1615905295.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gr4jzti", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m5prdt", "parent_id": "t3_m5prdt", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Set some goals - short term and long term.

Maybe you will want to join a language exchange app to start practicing talking in italian, etc.\n\nTry to study regularly, everyday, every other day, whatever you can do. And once you pick some study methods try to keep progressing and challenging yourself - so if you have a textbook work through the textbook instead of stopping it and restarting another at the beginner part again. If you have a podcast you like keep listening to new more challenging material etc. As a beginner I used to keep finding New study materials and restarting from the beginning. That held me back a lot lol since I kept repeating easy stuff instead of learning to do more for a while.\n\nWhat other people said - check out the wiki here. You're probably going to want to make a study plan for how to learn. The wiki will give you ideas of things you might want: vocabulary lists/flashcards, apps, textbooks, methods, podcasts, tutors, language exchange partners etc. If you're self studying a language the first time, it might also take time to learn How you like to learn. I like to learn by doing - I read a grammar guide, learn some common words, then I mostly read and listen in a language and try to chat with people. The sooner I'm using the language while learning from context the happier I am. Even though it feels draining as a beginner lol. But some people love flashcards, some people love structure of textbooks or courses etc. There's free courses like on coursera for people who do want structure. So it might take time to find what methods you even like.\n\nIf you do happen to be like me in tastes, I have 2 book recommendations. One is Teach Yourself Italian. Its not fancy, its cheap. I got it used at a thrift store. But Teach Yourself writes very easy to follow and to the point, has a lot of common words, and covers a lot of material so you have a nice beginner foundation when its completed. I've tried Berlitz and 'Living Language' books before and like Teach Yourself a lot better. It was also a ton like the textbooks I've used in college classes in terms of structure, just more simplified. If you like structure at first its a nice place to start. I'm sure there's many better textbooks/free websites, but its a useable one. \n\nIf you learn best by Doing, like me: L'italiano Secondo Il Metodo Natura. It can be read for free here: https://archive.org/details/LitalianoSecondoIlMetodoNatura . The book is entirely in Italian, and will teach you in context while using the language (so no outside dictionary is needed) words and grammar to a decent amount. Afterward you should be able to move into Italian novels/shows/native materials to learn new words, and have conversations and practice smoothing out that skill. Only things I'd add are: the book is old so you might learn some old/out of date stuff, and one should probably do a learner podcast like 'Coffee Break Italian' or something for listening practice and pronunciation examples. I had a book like this for french and it was perfect for the way I learn - before I found it I'd read a grammar guide, read some common word lists, and just been reading French websites looking up a TON of words to understand what I read, slowly trying to learn French. Then I found the French book and it was graded to be exactly my reading level so I'd never need a dictionary to pick up all the new words and grammar.

This is most of what I do. For French this was nearly all I did - I looked at a common word list every few days for the first few months (so like flashcards I guess).

Every several months I'd do some active study like read a grammar book, or do a language exchange, or do speaking/pronunciation practice for a month or two.\n\nChinese - this is all I'm doing right now. Early on I did 2000 flashcards in a couple months, then no flashcards for several months, then 500 flashcards in a month. I also read a grammar guide in the first few months. Everything else has just been reading novels, watching chinese with chinese subtitles, listening to audiobooks. When I want to intensively read I will look up a lot of unknown words as I read, when I want to extensively read I look up no words or only a couple as I feel like it. I don't write down the words I look up, I don't make flashcards. This works great for me. The initial flashcards helped 'speed up' how much I could comprehend. Otherwise getting to a tolerable reading speed/reading comprehension would have probably taken longer. But after those flashcards, I understood enough that I can just see words repeatedly as I read, look them up when I feel like it, and learn them over time. I can understand enough words in context to pick some up over time. So my progress is going steadily. I think as a beginner flashcards (or textbooks with vocab lists, classes with vocab, grammar guide overviews or classes with grammar explanation etc), all help you get to a part where you can start learning a lot from context easier. Once its tolerable to read/watch and you can At Least understand the bare minimum gist of the main ideas, then dropping all those and just looking up words/seeing them over and over starts feeling like you learn new things at a decent pace. At least it does for me. \n\nA way to also 'bridge the gap' is to use graded readers, and learner podcasts, when you don't know many words/grammar points yet. They'll usually be easier to understand, so you can guess words from context and look up a tolerable number of new things (but not too many you feel overwhelmed), and run into them repeatedly until you learn them. Its a bit slower than flashcards, but also works fine and will eventually help make just reading/listening to harder things in the language feel manageable. With chinese and french, I did a graded reader or two before I tried to read novels.

If you\u2019re learning chinese, Pleco app can do this too in either free \u201cclipboard Reader\u201d where you can copy paste in text then click for definitions/hear things read, or the one time cost Reader tool which I use constantly since it can open up websites and most documents and I can bookmark and save things.\n\nCoursera - app with a lot of free (and paid) courses inside it. Many colleges and other groups offer language courses on there. Many of these are very similar to a class you would take in your local college as far as material covered, levels of beginner/intermediate etc courses. Really good for if you want regular class type structure and progression but on an app. \n\nNot apps but can be used on a phone: LanguageTransfer.org has lots of courses for free, all audio, you can listen on your phone and they\u2019re great. Likewise \u201ccoffee break French (or X language)\u201d is on SoundCloud I think and the coffee break courses are all audio and easy to learn from as a beginner.", "created_utc": "1615746986.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqxaz6x", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m4z7rt", "parent_id": "t3_m4z7rt", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I do think your current strategy may work fine for Russian in the long run. Languages less similar to your native language just sometimes take more time to make the same amount of progress. When I studied Japanese, it took 4 times as long to hit the same milestones of progress I hit when learning French. Even with my study methods being similar. I changed my study plan a bit for Chinese - which is mostly just me using what has worked best in the past and not doing what didn't work as well. And Chinese still takes 2-3 times as long as French to reach the same milestones. So don't be discouraged by slower progress! The fact you are making progress is good. Even if its slower, if you're seeing progress then it is a study method that is working for you.\n\nI have learned over time, as I studied languages, what methods worked better for me. And also that some languages required extra work that others didn't. So in that way my study plan had to change for different languages. With French, it was similar enough to english I never used flashcards or any particular memory techniques. With Japanese, I learned what mnemonics were and used them to learn kanji and new words - since a lot of words had no english cognate. I also used srs flashcards to speed up how fast I could learn words, because it was so much harder for me to remember the japanese words compared to french words. With Chinese it has been a mix - mnemonics helped, flashcards helped, but the more hanzi I know the easier words are to figure out and remember so I don't need as much support as japanese. So now I study it a lot more like french. For french, I barely did listening practice until years in. Which is a mistake I think. In Chinese, I did listening as part of my study immediately and often because I did not want to lack in that area again. With French I am still backtracking and learning to listen better because I could 'coast by' early on and so neglected the skill too much. With Chinese, I tried to do better and looked into tones, practiced tone pairs, practice listening to audiobooks, always look up word pronunciations, etc. I make a lot of better choices on what to study so I don't have the same issues I had when I studied French. \n\nI don't know if that helped. Just sometimes, you will have a good overall study plan. But maybe a new language will be easier for you if you have more tools that work good FOR studying that language, that you could get away with not using for another language. Mnemonics aren't super needed for a similar language, since words often sound 'familiar' enough you can just remember them. But a less similar language like Russian you may find mnemonics useful for speeding up the process. You might not need to put effort into practicing listening to a similar language, because you can mostly follow the sounds you hear. But in another language, you may need to really dig in and study pronunciation because too much is hard for you to grasp. You already seem to have a good overall study plan for yourself - study grammar, increase vocabulary, engage with language. If it works, good! You just may notice that Russian has less cognates and so more vocabulary you need to learn before it feels as easy. So maybe you need to learn new methods to speed up vocabulary learning - textbooks with MORE vocabulary, srs flashcards, actively looking up more vocabulary when engaging with russian content etc. Maybe the grammar is harder for you to understand - maybe you need to find a site that Makes you do grammar drills to really practice them over and over, or make yourself do textbook exercises, or take a free Coursera course so you have to write out answers/have a teacher, or join a Language Exchange app so you get regular practice using grammar. Whatever will help it stick better for you. You'll have to explore to see what that is. Also though, even with some additional methods to help make it easier, Russian may still simply take longer to make the same milestones of progress.", "created_utc": "1615563123.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gqp5ut4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m34tx6", "parent_id": "t3_m34tx6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I felt like I couldn't learn languages, I tried Spanish, German, Mandarin in school and got As but never remembered anything afterward. I couldn't do anything in the language. I tried to learn Japanese on my own and also failed to learn anything more than kana and some basics - just like with the others. \n\nAs an adult, I decided I really wanted to see IF I could learn to do anything in a language or if I was too bad at doing it. I love studying languages, its why I kept trying, but I had no idea how to study a way that worked for me. So in college, I took a French class. I only picked french because it was a language I hadn't tried learning at all before, so I could really see 'if I learned anything new.'\n\nWhile in that class, I found french books from the 1930s in a thrift store. I like history, I was curious, I wanted to read them. THAT is what kicked off my learning. I looked up \"how to learn to read french/a language\" etc. I started making goals on \"doing something in a language.\" That helped me so much. Before in classes, I'd just learned whatever they taught - how to greet, verb conjugations and words about jobs or hobbies. But I never needed to small talk in another language and had no desire to. What I wanted to do was have conversations about Anything on my mind, is pick up a book or enter a website and browse content, etc. So I started making THOSE my goals. Looking up \"how to read in a language\" I found suggestions to learn the most common words to make reading easier (so I would have to look up less words). That gave me a vocab list to study I could use right away - versus my language classes that gave me vocab by section topic like hobbies, small talk, animals, a lot of which didn't make reading easier. I saw tips to read grammar guides, and summaries of grammar - so I did that. (Although I was really lucky, my french teacher wanted to prioritize teaching us 'how to talk about anything if we could look up a word' so she taught us simple past/present/future conjugation and like 200 verbs in the first semester - its much easier to express oneself when you have mutliple tenses you can say). So I had a specific goal - learn to read these books I had gotten. And I practiced. I tried to read french news every few days, and would reference my common word list and lookup new words I couldn't figure out. Eventually I'd practice with random french sites. Eventually I practiced with my books. When my books got doable, I started trying to read whatever I wanted.\n\nI made a goal to try speaking about things in the language, so I joined a language exchange app. It was hard, even knowing common words, so I kept looking things up. I found a wonderful list on tumblr called \"300 words to express yourself basically\" which basically covered words you need for basic ideas + a dictionary for specific topics. It gave me a starting place. \n\n Basically just... me setting a concrete goal for \"what do I want to DO\" is what helped motivate me. And helped me figure out How to study personally. Because yes, a class will teach me to pass my tests. It will teach me whats covered in a textbook - usually a beginner class is small talk and shopping, money, descriptions of yourself. But if I had a specific goal, I could make plans for that - some textbooks will suit those goals better, some resources, etc. I realized I wanted to and could go through grammar and vocabulary faster than my class, but my class was also good for practicing writing/speaking and getting critiqued. Also what helped me was purposefully trying to DO my goal activity frequently. Then I could see in reality how much I was improving, what I needed to study, and could think about what resources would help more. Once I learned 2000 words and had been reading a while, I found a french grammar guide in french and read into the more advanced topics the basic grammar guide I'd read as a beginner never covered - because I needed more knowledge about grammar to make reading clearer to me. When I was practicing listening to a show or podcast I realized how bad I was at it, and looked up learner podcasts specifically so I could practice ALL listening all speaking and improve there. Then tested again later if my listening had improved. Etc. Reading is pretty obvious - I'd read every couple days, and the less I needed to look up words, the more I understood, improvement was clear. And if I was struggling, I could notice why and make study plans for it - more vocabulary, review x grammar, maybe its a new subject I'm unfamiliar with, etc.\n\nNow whenever I go into learning a language I make concrete goals of things I want to do now and later, and practice trying to do those goals regularly so I have an idea of where I am, and what kinds of study methods I will want to do to work on getting better at those goals.", "created_utc": "1615479061.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gql3iv8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m2avf2", "parent_id": "t3_m2avf2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Mm.

So if your number of 'known words' in whatever you use to track that keeps increasing, its a good sign you're doing something right. Even if the count is not perfect.\n\nI don't know how LinQ counts. If I were you I'd just count flashcards you made. You could divide that number by 3 if you wanted.

But at minimum, it wasn't until I got through those 2000 common words that I could start bearing reading/watching. I don't know how many words above that I knew.\n\nAt 1000 words through the flashcard deck I tried watching, and it would make me feel very drained and I could barely follow a main idea - and would need to pause to look a ton of words up each scene.

Everyone will personally have a different tolerance.\n\nSo I knew at least the 'minimum' amount of words I knew because of flashcards. Nowadays, when I read its inside my app Pleco where I can bookmark words I lookup. So I can glance at my bookmarked words number to see 'at minimum' how many unique words I've looked up before. It is a minimum guess though, since lots of words I look up during shows I never save. Lots of words I already know I never bother saving either so they aren't included in the count. I can only guess a lower end of words I might know.\n\nIf you use an app like Clozemaster, sentences mastered would give you an estimate of words you've studied. Just like Memrise or Anki would give you an estimate.

I read a grammar guide, and I used flashcards until I knew 2000 words, and after that I looked up a lot of words when immersing. Even now, when I'm reading, half the time I'll look up most new words (and the other half I'll just extensively read and guess new words from context).\n\n2. Immersing with Portuguese subtitles so you can follow along helps. Or no subtitles sometimes, if you want to practice listening more eventually. Look up new words in the subtitles or when you hear them - if you need to understand a word to understand the main idea. If you can understand at least the bare minimum main gist of what's going on, you'll also start learning some words just from context. Example: you see a group scared, they shout something then run, you can guess they might have said 'run' and learn the word. And more complicated scenes you may have to look up words before you can guess some other words from context. You can definitely start immersing as early as you want! You practice listening to the language/reading it at speaking speed when you do, and practice interpreting it in context.

I really recommend mnemonics if you have no idea where to start - little stories based on character radicals, meanings (and hopefully pronunciation) that help you remember the hanzi. And before you do that - look up chinese radicals. Seeing the radicals so you can be somewhat familiar with them, and understand how multiple make up a character, makes it much easier to see brand new characters and recognize how they're written and what pieces make them up. When you can recognize that, it's easier to get familiar with new characters. Also looking into radicals a little and how often a radical may hint at the pronunciation or vague meaning of the word. Its easier to remember a new character if you know one of the radicals in it is pronounced similar to the character, if you know the radical 'heart' is in it and the character has to do with a feeling.\n\nI particular I really liked this book as a beginner \"Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters: (HSK Levels 1 -3) A Revolutionary New Way to Learn and Remember the 800 Most Basic Chinese Characters.\" Its mnemonics are easy to remember, include a way to remember tone/pinyin/meaning (most other premade mnemonic books leave it up to you to remember pronunciation without help). Also the book includes a ton of useful beginner Words under each hanzi, so you can learn some words the hanzi are used in as you study. Other good books for learning hanzi with mnemonics - Alan Hoenig's \"Chinese Characters: Learn & Remember 2,178 Characters and Their Meanings.\" That book has mnemonics to remember the meaning of all hanzi in the book, and includes pronunciation next to hanzi so you can reference it. Also Heisig's \"Remember the Hanzi\" - it explains how to make mnemonics so I would recommend reading its intro for free if you can find it as a sample or in a library, even if you don't get the book. I did not like that Heisig's book does NOT include mnemonics after a certain point and its up to you to make them up.\n\nIf you like flashcards, someone made anki decks of hanzi with mnemonics (unfortunately I do not think it includes pronunciation so you'd need to look up pronunciation yourself).

I decided to take a French class since i'd never tried to learn it before, and wanted to see if I tried if I could actually learn to do something in a language. The class was actually pretty nice - my teacher prioritized teaching us a high vocab, pronunciation, and basic past/present/future tenses. Which helped a lot with quickly being able to talk about daily life stuff instead of only greetings and controlled conversations like 'buying something' or 'explaining hobbies.' We learned like 100 verbs one week. Still it was all A1 stuff pretty much. But I could actually do something - talk vaguely about things, especially if I looked up words, which was more than I could ever do before.

But I'd never made any real progress into being able to do something in a language before then.

HSK 1-6 have courses that include all the vocabulary and grammar. I like the free course by National Taiwan University \"Learning Chinese: Start from Scratch\" - its the closest I've found to a comprehensive course that covers what a class might. There's a lot more courses too. These are most likely to cover everything an interactive textbook would.\n\n2. Pleco - a dictionary, a reader tool. Its amazing. I read novels in it. Its also a great dictionary, has a built in flashcard srs tool, a free reader called \"Clipboard Reader\" if you don't want to buy the Reader (but its a one time cost so i did) - which can open anything you paste in and give you click definitions, audio for a word or entire passage. The Reader tool proper can also open a variety of files, webpages. There's graded readers you can purchase if you want to work on going through those. I use it every day, and its my favorite language learning app I've ever used. It's not a course at all, but a very useful tool.\n\n3. *Ninchanese - I haven't used this much because its too slow paced for my taste, but its a website that covers HSK 1-5 and covers multiple skills. Pretty much the closest to 'an app covering what an interactive textbook' that I've found. Lingodeer covers some similar material especially for the beginning stages, but Ninchanese seems to cover More of the HSK levels and just generally include more. \n\n4. Dong-chinese.com - a website and google play app. I've used the website version. Its pinyin and pronunciation guide is a great intro, it has amazing word lists with example sentences/videos/frequency/related words. It is great as a resource in a lot of ways (and this is only the free version since I have no idea what additional benefits the paid version includes). However I haven't seen grammar explanations on the site, and if you want to production skills etc then again the Coursera and Ninchanese courses are more likely to work on those skills as well. I found it to be most useful as a reference material (I think its learning content is similar to comprehensible sentence mining/flashcards? Which I rarely study from).\n\nThe * options might suit what you're looking for better. Although truly, a nice comprehensive textbook might suit what you're looking for best.

I think immersion has helped me a lot. With chinese, I went to memrise and found a 2000 most common word flashcard deck. I learned it over a few months. I also read through a grammar guide from start to finish to get an overview of the grammar. And I got an 800 common hanzi book and read through most of it to learn to recognize some common ones. Only after that did I start immersing. And when I immersed I'd still look up more new words, still look up grammar points again in new sources to clarify. It took months before immersion felt less-draining and until I felt I comprehended a good 'basic' amount. Also in the beginning I used graded readers (with limited vocabulary of 300 words, 500, 1000, 2000) as my immersion practice when working through the flashcards as the graded readers became manageable. Immersing regularly I didn't feel comfortable doing until month 8+, and I didn't feel decent at following plots until months 11+. Likewise, I didn't push into reading real novels until around then, and reading has taken a bit longer to feel 'bearable.' \n\nSo basically - study a little beforehand. Studying a bunch of common words helps, so when you immerse you have a lot of review to learn them quickly. And once you learn them, they make stuff more immediately comprehensible to a % you can stand. Look at grammar guides, or textbooks, websites - any learning material you like - for some basics on pronunciation and grammar so when you start immersing you Know vaguely what you're looking at. Knowing x is an adjective, y is a verb, this is a negative/positive statement, all help a lot when looking at unknown sentences and trying to figure out what's going on from context. Make yourself some basis of basic understanding, then immersion can help because you Will understand a little - hopefully enough to start catching understanding a little more. Then you can build up that understanding more. (Through more immersion, through word lookup, through more flashcards/textbooks/courses etc to supplement immersion, etc whatever you end up doing).", "created_utc": "1614795270.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gpk6dzn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lwkuv1", "parent_id": "t3_lwkuv1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Yep!

I happened to like memrise, did 2000 common chinese words decks. (I also like clozemaster for sentences now that I'm a bit better). I read a free grammar guide online at the same time. I basically just read a full grammar guide, learned 2000 common words, then pushed myself to start reading/watching/listening and communicating with peopple on exchange apps. I felt like that was giving me more challenging stuff more quickly than any language study app I'd found. With memrise I just crammed through the 2000 in a couple months, reviewed a little for a month or two more as I started with graded readers on Pleco then found webnovels.\n\nWhen I moved onto Pleco - a dictionary app with a wonderful Reader tool, so I can read novels/webpages etc. I use ximalaya for audiobooks, viki/iqiyi/youtube for shows, Hellotalk or Tandem for language exchange. Occasionally I go back to anki or memrise when I want to cram more words with flashcard apps (but mostly I hate flashcards). The Spoonfed Chinese anki deck is nice, but also someone made 30 minute audio files of the deck which i prefer to listen to as study sometimes.\n\nI started with pretty simple webnovels and manhua, and shows I liked, around 8 months in - and it was very difficult but doable. Then after about a year it started getting easier. I read various textbooks now sometimes as references to work on improving errors when I communicate or fill in vocabulary gaps. I could alternatively use nice grammar decks and vocab decks on anki/memrise to improve now but i truly can't be consistent long with flashcards.\n\nSome stuff you can do independently instead of a learning app: read any free grammar guide (AllSetLearning Chinese Grammar Guide, chinese-grammar.com - this is the one I read through in a couple weeks), memrise/anki decks of common words or sentences with common words, memrise/anki hanzi decks, hanzi reference books (I love Tuttle Learn Chinese Characters with 800 characters/HSK beginner words and great mnemonics, Alan Hoenig's Chinese Characters), clozemaster (sentences so know some common words and grammar before you start), free youtube/viki/iqiyi dramas (mydramalist is a good place to search for recs), ximalaya audiobooks and dramas (or any you can google and find), Chinese Spoonfed anki audio (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MCKgOxzW9cd1u9cWjzGwWrpxnL5pDz0w?usp=sharing), webnovels (Pleco Reader to read them, Mandarinspot.com Text Annotator, Zhongwen chrome extension, a kindle/tablet with dictionary click lookup, can find recommendations on mynovelupdates).

I found a list saying Duolingo covers 1500 chinese words. I can't find how many words Lingodeer includes. And I'm not sure how high up either go in the teaching of grammar (say compared to HSK levels).

I have 2 uteruses so I couldn't get the copper iud, I have bad reactions to bc pills even the mini pill which we were trying out. So I wanted it since its non hormonal, no side effects, and reliable. It was easier as surgeries go. I went in the morning to the hospital, went into surgery, they put the IV in. While unconcious they did 3 small incisions, took out my tubes, I was in surgery recovery and they gave me pain medication. I got to go home a couple hours after I got there. I had pain meds prescribed and also directions, I took as directed. I was tired and sitting upright at a bend made me feel tired/a bit sore for the first week. So I took the first few days off work. Then after about a week I stopped taking the pain meds, and its been 2 weeks and I feel pretty much good again! I'm clear to exercise again and lift weights which is what I'd wanted lol. My scars are very small like the size of a small staple, the scabs already fell off and they're just slightly off color skin. In a couple months they'll probably fade and be totally unnoticable. The only part that really sucked was getting the IV put in since I hate needles, and the week after I really had to keep on top of the pain medication since my period hit 2 days after surgery and my periods are usually agony so it was both pain on top. That said, with what they told me to do I barely felt any pain even when my period kicked in. It went great, I could have sex again in a few days but I waited a week and you should follow whatever recommendations your doctor gives.\n\nMy doctor said there might be a little bleeding post surgery, but I didn't have any. Also the doctor said to call them if I felt like I was in a lot of pain - I wasn't. The only time I was in pain is right when I woke up from surgery, I'm guessing maybe they hadn't put pain meds into my IV yet. It just felt like Really Bad Period cramps, so they immediately gave me some more when I woke up, I cried for a few minutes until the medicine kicked in (and probably some people will not wake up with that timing and have that issue at all lol). But after that the worst pain was just some aching which I'd notice when I'd forget to take the painkiller the first few days. They prescribed me something alongside just taking ibuprofen/Tylenol every 6 hours, 3 hours between one and the other so they overlapped. I only had to take the prescribed painkiller twice the first 2 days (right as my period came to kick my ass). After a few days I didn't have to take the painkiller as often as I was just a bit sore. \n\nI'm super happy! I had a surgery a year prior to get my gallbladder removed due to stomach issues, and that surgery was a lot worse. It was the same type - 3 incisions to remove the gallbladder. But the cuts were bigger, and I could see and feel the stitches for months, it took several months for them to fade, and I lost a ton of my abdominal strength post-surgery so I had to do a lot to build those muscles back up for months. (I also had scar tissue cut out which idk maybe that's why I had loss of strength there). So it took like 6 months to get back to feeling as strong as normal and not getting tired out from bending/walking/doing things requiring strength there lol. And the stitches took longer to fade. But bilateral salpingectomy? Its been 2 weeks and my stitches are so tiny and already barely noticeable. I did not lose any strength and within a few days of surgery sitting up stopped tiring me out so I'm very happy I don't have to build up my strength again lol. Overall a much easier surgery. I've had a lot of surgeries in my life though so like, it was definitely the easiest - the other ones I was dying or in the gallbladder case recovery just took so much longer. \n\nSo its just the going into the hospital, the small IV part, and then the 1-2 weeks you'll need to take pain meds as needed. Then you should be all set. I am so happy I don't have to worry about bc anymore, and it has no health effects. \n\nI have a very nice obgyn who's been helping me, since I have a not so common anatomy so they help with any issues. And we tried a few kinds of birth control before this - I couldn't get an iud with my shape, so we tried a few hormone bc. I had really bad side effects with them, I never want to have kids, do not want to risk pregnancy, I told them I wanted to get sterilized. I'm mid 20s, single, no kids. They scheduled the surgery for 2 months after that. My obgyn is helpful, I'm not sure if some would try to argue more - and if they did I'd maybe get a new obgyn or maybe come prepared with some info like why you want to be sterilized, that you understand what you're asking etc, from r/childfree. I went over there and found some stuff to prepare. But I was very fortunate in that my doctor didn't argue or question me. They knew we'd gone through other options already, just let me know that if I did it then I would only be able to have kids if I went through IVF or adopted. I'm great with that as I might only maybe want kids one day if a partner has them, a partner is pregnant, or a partner really wants to adopt and we're settled enough in our lives to consider it.

I never did immersion without anything. But before I found refold, I did not use anki or flashcards like memrise. I only had a word frequency list of 2000 common words that I looked at every couple days for while, and I would look words up as I immersed when I felt like it. Then I stopped needing the frequency list, and switched to only immersion and looked up things when I felt like it. For grammar, I'd read a free french grammar guide on the internet over a week, then just looked back at it every once in a while for reference as I immersed. Like the word frequency list, by a few months in I no longer needed the grammar guide. \n\nThis method worked perfectly fine with french. I think using srs flashcards like anki would have sped up my learning. But without them, I still got to the point I could stop looking at the word frequency list within a few months. I could read things comfortably with a dictionary by 6 months. By a year I could read and get the main idea without a dictionary and guess words from context. At this point I read a french grammar website in french, to fill in any gaps in grammar understanding I had when reading. So I did that over a month, then just continued regular immersion. Then by 2 years I stopped considering immersion 'study' and just read french whenever I want. \n\nFor listening, I just immersed. I really liked Alice Ayel and French Comprehensible Input youtube channels at the beginning. I mainly only tried to learn to read, so I can't say how fast listening/speaking/writing can become 'fluent'. My listening is weak because I barely immersed, my writing/speaking is probably A2 - I can have casual conversations and follow other people, but I don't have a very big active vocab to respond since I rarely practiced. \n\nSo I didn't do total immersion - I also looked at a grammar guide site, and a common word list. But no srs flashcards/anki. For french it took 2 years. For japanese, my progress was about 4 times slower doing that - and sped up a TON when I started doing nukemarine's LLJ memrise srs deck. Which is how I eventually found Refold. So immersion without anki will eventually work but be slower. However I don't know if immersion can work without Any sort of supplementary study material to get the basics (basic vocab to rely on in initial immersion, basic grammar to understand overall sentence structures you see, basic pronunciation guide to see what to listen for).\n\nI hate flashcards so I mostly don't do anki. I just do flashcards when I want a quick 'boost' to my progress - since I do think flashcards speed it up. SRS is designed to help you remember things faster, and in that way it works. It helps a lot more noticeably in languages less similar to english. With japanese I waited 2 years to use srs flashcards and made very slow progress until I did that. With chinese I've been using flashcards about every 5 months for a month then dropping them again, and as a result my chinese is only taking 1.5x as long as french took instead of 4x like japanese. This speed is fast enough for me, so I don't bother using flashcards unless I feel like it.

I found some french books from the 1930s at a thrift store at the time, got very motivated to read them and see the perspectives of the time. I also finally started learning How I could successfully study a language. So a lot of the motivation was just to prove to myself I could even learn to do something.

A lot of the review for the kanji you'll need to remember constantly, you'll get naturally when you immerse a lot and are seeing all the kanji you need to know used all the time. I think RRTK can be very valuable for making the jump into reading easier - because you will recognize pieces of words (the kanji) even if only vaguely sometimes, which gives you something to attach the new word to. And as you learn more words, those vaguely known kanji attach to words you've learned - and they reinforce each other.\n\nRRTK does not have to be a strict thing though. Some people really go in and learn all of the kanji first, some even learn writing and readings too during this time, some skip RRTK, some do some of RRTK then move on, some go back to it as needed in between other months of studying with other things. I studied 500 hanzi, jumped into chinese reading and learning vocab (so I guess the equivalent would be like the tango deck and reading/watching immersion). Then a few months later, I knew 2000 words from my vocabulary deck, and the wall I was hitting was unknown hanzi I encountered too little in common words to have learned but often enough in reading that I needed to know them. So I went through RTH, very fast through 1000 just making sure I recognized them, then actually studied the hanzi 1000-1500 because those were the ones I didn't know at all but kept running into. After that, I could pick up most new hanzi just from reading again. \n\nI've never studied my cards to maturity before moving on, although a lot of people do and I think it stick in your memory much better. I study my flashcard decks like RTH until I've gotten through what I wanted to (or the whole thing in the 2000 word deck), and then I review it occassionally while mostly just immersing. Immersing is where I'll run into what I need to remember most and will use most. For me the flashcards are like prep work, exposure beforehand so I have a vague idea of what they are and some recognition which makes fully learning them during immersion easier. I think with RRTK, its up to each person on what's going to help them learn best. Some people just want an intro to the kanji, some people want them fully learned before moving on. Either way its not a waste of time if later on you find it's helped you, compared to going into immersion without using it at all (which some people do too and works for them).", "created_utc": "1612708290.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmftdvl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_leewv6", "parent_id": "t3_leewv6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "You won't lose progress. But also, you do not need to expect progress so fast! How much you can understand, after studying 13 months, is already excellent progress of everything you've done so far! Don't expect yourself to make improvements any faster than you've been before, don't feel bad if its the same pace as before - yes you may eventually progress faster, but you don't need to put pressure on yourself to make this work any better than a previous method you did. You just started the refold method and it hasn't even been a month - it takes some people 3 months, 6 months, a year, before the start noticing how well refold has given them progress to the amount they wanted. For some people those milestones are only the beginning of bigger ones.\n\nYou should do whatever keeps you engaged with the language. If immersing 6-8 hours is burning you out, you can immerse less. If you get burned out after using anki/flashcards to X extent, you can use them less. I can't handle flashcards well, so I use premade decks (since making them makes me give up), I do them in bursts (focus for a few weeks, complete maybe 500 cards or 1000), then take a break, then in a month or 2 do another burst of new cards. I find looking words up while immersing, and NOT saving them, keeps me curious and looking things up without wanting to stop. And doing flashcards as needed to speed up my progress, when I can focus on them, helps me get through plateaus. Like when I wanted to learn to read and just use a dictionary for key unknown words, I really needed to get through 2000 cards before that task was feasible. So I did 500 card bursts for 2 months, and then dropped cards for a few months and only read. What I'm trying to say is different things will work for different people, and all will eventually progress IF you can keep yourself engaging with the language and challenging yourself. \n\nIf you're going to lose anything, you might temporarily find your 'partially' learned anki cards you forget and need to refresh when you get back into card studying. But you can fix that by just reviewing minimally (instead of a larger amount or adding cards etc), or just prepare to review a little when you get back to them. It depends on the person, but for me, most of what I've learned with cards I don't lose when I stop them for a while - mainly because a big portion of my flashcard study material I see regularly in immersion, so it eventually sticks since I'm 'reviewing' it in immersion if its important. Its a bit slower, so doing flashcards does speed the process up or boost it, but just immersing you will ultimately maintain what you know and progress. Especially since you already have a base level of comprehension in spanish after so many months.\n\nSometimes people feel burnt out from immersion because they need more flashcards/active study time to boost what they comprehend so immersion is less draining. Sometimes doing active study/flashcards is boring, is taking a lot of time that's less fun to them (if they make cards and hate doing it etc), and then they burn out before they even get to immersing - so they could lower how much they do cards. The goal is to just keep yourself from giving up. And keep challenging yourself - if you find comics easy to read, it might be time to try novels. If you find youtube videos easy, it might be time to try documentaries or news or movies etc. I realized my listening was poor, and I was a bit burned out from reading, so I focused on more audiobooks for a while.

A few years ago my stomach doctor prescribed 10-20 mg amitriptyline for my overall abdomen stomach pain, which just happened to also help my extremely bad period pain a bit. Now that's currently what I'm taking for my period pain, though the dose can be increased as needed. At the current low dose, it works as a muscle relaxer for the abdomen and doesn't affect much else which is why it was started so low. My periods are currently: I take max dose ibuprofen, max dose tylenol, get into a very hot bathtub, and am in immense pain for several hours once it hits. I take my amitriptyline on top, if I haven't been taking it prior. Then eventually after several hours and a few hot baths, I can manage to get under a heat pad and keep taking the max doses for the next 5 days. That first day its usually unbearable no matter what, all that is just so I'm screaming a little less, and I'm glad this past year has been work from home because prior I used to have to call in sick if it hit a day I was working. The days afterwards, if I don't miss any painkillers or amitriptyline and stay mostly under a heat pad, its bearable. \n\nThe past couple months I've been taking the amitriptyline a full week before my period starts - which is when I start feeling cramp pain (not unbearable just a bit painful and ibuprofen stops the pain easily), and when my mood usually drops intensely. So far, that's helped a lot, and I didn't have to get in a bathtub for 8 hours last time it hit - it managed to be bearable with all the painkiller and heatpad, with me able to lighten the painkiller doses somewhat the 2nd day onward. \n\nI have always had a bad period, but since my stomach health issues and after its been so bad that sometimes max doses of painkiller and my muscle relaxer don't even mask the pain enough for me to stop crying the first day. Which is why I went to the doctor. Whereas years ago, if I took pain killer and applied heat immediately that first day, I could usually get the pain bearable within an hour or two and if I had to miss work it would only be a couple hours. My doctor didn't find anything wrong when they checked, but I do have 2 uteruses so they don't know if that's a part of why my periods hurt so much. I just mention in case amitriptyline or some similar muscle relaxer/nerve medicine might be a temporary option until you can get a hysterectomy. My body reacts better to regular painkiller and nerve affecting medicine without side effects, whereas it can't handle any hormone medicine I've tried.  My doctor tried the mini-pill to stop the period too, but the side effects were so severe that overall quality of life wise it was worse. *Also if it helps: my doctor tried a non-nerve affecting muscle relaxer years ago too, before amitriptyline.

I'm guessing they also looked for cysts/other possible causes of pain? \n\nI also went into my doctor recently, because my periods have been so intensely bad lately, and its already been extremely bad beforehand but in the year before I'd assumed the pain was due to an abdomen pain issue related to my stomach making it worse. I also went in because I want to be sterilized. My doctor did an ultrasound to check for endometriosis or cysts. They didn't find anything noticeable, so they aren't sure if its endo or if I've just gotten worse periods over time. They wanted me to try the mini-pill as a hormone solution to stop the pain. We tried, but I've expressed doubts about hormone medicines before since I've had a lot of really bad side effect previous times I tried. She hoped it being the mini-pill would minimize the risk of that. It didn't, I stopped it. She decided to continue with my prescription of amytyptline, which my stomach doctor years prior gave me to help muscle relax my abdomen and make the pain at the time tolerable. My doctor said its been working somewhat for the period pain, and may be the most compatible option to keep doing since hormone bc pills don't react well with me. So far, that plans been working ok, but we don't have a lot of options if it doesn't. If I did have endometriosis to a noticeable degree, I think she'd have considered a hysterectomy.

She didn't bingo me, just let me know it was unlikely to improve my period pain (which is why we were also trying other things to help with that), might lower my risk of cervical cancer, and to be aware it would be difficult/ I'd need in-vitro if I wanted to have kids later. She also said it wouldn't affect my health except as a birth control to prevent pregnancy. We did discuss other options like hysterectomy, but she had concerns that the procedure might affect me more and since she didn't find physical issues when checking for endometriosis/issues she thinks its not needed at the moment. My doctor treated my desire to address the intense pain, and my desire to be sterilized, as two health concerns to help with.

That was around 4 years ago. So in those 4 years, I occasionally did a month working on active vocabulary (since that goes up and down depending on if I am communicating often in french), my listening comprehension (it lags behind my reading comprehension because I rarely practiced), and working on grammar errors when I write/speak (mostly just writing and running stuff through a grammar checker to catch common errors I still make or need to remember how to write). I did some grammar study at first, but like you plan, I picked up a lot just through reading - and I totally think its pretty easy to do so. For a language similar to your native language, there's a lot of forgiveness in not doing things particularly efficiently and still making progress pretty decently. And like you mention with vocab, I knew enough french grammar early on to generally follow a sentence and at least guess some of the unknown vocab. \n\nWith french, I mainly studied in order to read. I could read with a dictionary in about 6 months, and then without a dictionary in about a year, and comfortably without strained effort in about 2 years. So that's why my studies stopped being consistent after that. If I ever need communication/listening comprehension more, I'll go back to working on them as needed. Right now the communication I can do is enough for the conversations I have.\n\nChinese I started a bit over a year ago in August 2019. I remember because I got super into a cdrama, found out it had a half-untranslated novel, and desperately wanted to read that novel. I'd taken one chinese class in high school but didn't remember anything. But because of that, I just dived into learning chinese and got a lot more passionate as time went on in a broader way. I tried reading/listening super early on, trying to do things like french but with less mistakes lol. So I tried doing things early on. I started being able to read through novel chapters with a dictionary around month 10, and since then its gotten gradually less draining and I've needed the dictionary a bit less. Also I tend to move onto more difficult novels, so the novels I tried to read earlier on are now a lot easier than they were when I first tried (and I no longer need a dictionary to follow them). Chinese is no where near my goals yet, but I'm happy with the progress! I expected it to go much slower. I studied japanese for 2.5 years - and it took that long for me to even start to read mangas without a dictionary and grasp the main plots. Whereas in chinese it took less than 10 months before I could do that with manhua, and now I can follow most manhua pretty easily including their details without a dictionary. And I can read some easier novels without a dictionary and follow the gist, which I could never do or even attempt in japanese. \n\nI want to share just in case it might be useful to someone. I think a part of why my chinese study has been going easier is because I approached it like my chinese teacher had us do in high school. He never acted like hanzi required rote memorization or mnemonics - he wrote them and their pinyin, said the words, we took the notes, then we used them in schoolwork and conversations and tests. Nothing more was asked of us, and we didn't get told we needed to put any extra effort in. A lot of his students didn't care about chinese and were just put in there. He still managed to get us to complete our work, pass our tests which required us to write hanzi and walk through real conversations, and most of the class passed with good grades. When I studied japanese - a ton of resources told me 'how difficult it would be,' what a struggle it was, how I would need to expect a lot of work and failure. I think that I was afraid I'd never be able to do anything in japanese - and so I put off attempting to TRY to do things in japanese. That held me back a lot. I didn't make significant progress until year 2 in japanese because I finally pushed myself to TRY to listen to real conversations, and read (little things), and learn a lot of kanji and vocab as quickly as if it were just history vocabulary words for a test in a class.\n\nSo with Chinese, I tried to learn from my mistakes more. I acted like it wasn't going to be any harder than french. It definitely takes longer, and it takes more hours, so I don't think its as 'quick' to pick up as french was for me. But it is way easier than I expected it to be, I made progress faster than I thought I could (I would've been happy at 1/4 this past years progress lol). And I think a lot of the success was due to me assuming it would be easy, and just diving in and trying right away. While also knowing its ok if its challenging, because it does take more hours to improve in than maybe a language more similar to my native language english.\n\nAlso, in French I never bothered practicing listening comprehension much. In chinese, I did more of that early on, and continue to practice it more. So my listening comprehension in chinese may already be better than my french. I can listen to an audiobook chapter in chinese and catch some main ideas, or hear dialogue on the tv without subtitles and usually follow it fine, or hear a song and catch enough lyrics to look up the song. With french I rarely tried to do those tasks, and when I do try to do them they require more focus than chinese does at this point. I do think if I worked on it though, french may take less hours to improve. With Chinese and Japanese I did have to do more focused grammar study, and if I go back to japanese eventually once my chinese is where I'd like it at minimum, I've got a plan on where to continue. \n\nSorry I knew this was super long, feel free to ignore a lot of it lol I just wanted to include in case some might be useful. Mainly though just... if you want to read, and you're doing it like you are, you're ready and you will improve.

I find just tracking how long it takes to read a chapter gives me a rough idea of if I'm picking up new words and getting more comfortable with the grammar.

So you tracking a lot more specifics will likely help!\n\nFor an example, a few months ago I read a story called \u5bd2\u820d and at the beginning each chapter took me 1 and a half hours. About 4 chapters in they started taking 1 hour, 8 chapters in it started taking 40 minutes to finish a chapter, and 12 chapters in it was taking 20 minutes to finish a chapter. 20 minutes to finish a long chapter is generally my goal in chinese right now. It would be nice if I could read faster, but when listening to the audio aloud it usually takes 15-20 minutes so if I'm reading that fast then I at least know its about as fast as a speaking speed. I may still be looking up unknown words at this point, so by the time I reach that goal I either keep reading and continue to look up unknown words to learn them, or I find a new novel which is much more difficult for me to read and start on it instead. \n\nIf its more difficult, it gives me more unknown words per page to learn. So with the new more difficult novel, I will usually again start with a reading speed of 40 minutes to an hour per chapter, then just keep reading until chapters take less time to read. Eventually, I run into much less unknown words per chapter. While I said I jump between novels, right now I am just trying to read a novel all the way through. Its by one of my favorite authors, so I'm hoping as the reading speed improves I'll be able to finish it faster. Even if I pick up new words slower towards the end, I know I'll keep reading novels by this author so the words picked up will probably benefit me in the next novel I read of theirs. I started with each chapter taking 1 hour, by 10 chapters in each chapter was taking 40 minutes. Now I'm at chapter 27 and the chapters are taking around 30 minutes to finish. For me, tracking time is the easiest. \n\nSince you're using anki, tracking words looked up is nice. I use Pleco Reader to read novels, and a feature I like is that it shows me total words I've 'saved' - so although its hard for me to easily count how many words per chapter I've looked up, its easy for me to look at my saved words and see how many total new words I've looked up since starting a novel. If you use any pop-up dictionary reader you may also get this benefit, which is easier to check than daily counting of words if that's easier. Or just count your anki cards added per day/week/month to get an idea of new words looked up.\n\nYou might eventually want to look up a \"Spanish grammar guide\" or \"spanish grammar summary\" online. It might be unneeded. But if you do find new conjugations or grammar a bit hard for you to recognize when reading, sometimes just skimming a grammar guide will help you start recognizing those things more easily when reading. Then you will have those structures help you to figure out what new words are (verbs/adjectives/nouns etc) and some of what's going on. I did this before starting to read in French, and in Chinese, and in both cases it helped a lot. Especially with Chinese, it helped me have a framework to see new sentences and have a rough idea of what parts were doing what in a sentence and how to determine which hanzi to look up as separate words.", "created_utc": "1611852772.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl45d9v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l6vxie", "parent_id": "t3_l6vxie", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "What are you stuck with specifically?\n\nIf there's a kind of writing you aren't good at, first just try to do it more often. If you are struggling to write academic papers, looking up example topics and trying to write a few might help. Like with practicing writing a thesis, avoiding words like \"I...\" that some academic papers expect, etc. \n\nIf you're struggling to write with other people, then just finding some language partners to write longer things regularly with may help. If you already have conversation comfortably, just switch to more conversation through writing. Or try to write more journal entries where you practice expressing your thoughts on things. The benefit of writing in a conversation to someone over journaling would be that you could ask them to correct your mistakes. The benefit of journaling, would be you could do a few weeks or months and see how you've improved over time. Or compare your journal entries to articles people write on hobbies, and compare how you write on topics to how they do.\n\nIf it's actual grammar when writing that you are messing up on, finding a website where people can check your grammar will help.

Native english speakers also have to learn or relearn some basic grammar sometimes when getting used to writing essays better. Top things people tend to need to improve that I've seen when tutoring: difference between there/they're/their, too/to, have/had/I've/I have/I'd, basically a lot of slight word choice confusion, grammar like which verb tense to use in which sentence or part of sentence, when to start a new paragraph, how to include quotes and sources.", "created_utc": "1611605228.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gkqu1pu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l4t5tr", "parent_id": "t3_l4t5tr", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Which podcast have you been listening to?

If you enjoyed manga, then keep reading it when you do have time - if it interested you enough you kept doing, then that was working well for you even if there might be less or more effective activities.\n\nLately I've been very busy with other projects, so to immerse I've just been reading chapters of chinese novels when I have time - using a popup dictionary to look up unknown words, and listening to the audiobook chapter if I have time. Some days I only do a few pages, others I do a handful of chapters. It is working fine - although I'm sure I'd improve faster if I had more time to immerse. But doing something is still better than not at all, and when I get bored I'll probably switch to more listening or watching shows without english subs when I'm into shows again instead of books for a while.\n\nWhen you don't have a lot of time, it can help to just try and take what you normally do in a day and try to find a way to do it with japanese/target language. I'm (foolishly lol) re-learning the japanese I used to know this year, alongside chinese, so I've been playing quicksleur audio while just level grinding during video games.

When exercising or doing chores or any time I'd put on a youtube video/podcast on in the bg, just playing a chinese audiobook/drama instead sometimes. My immersion ends up 1-3 hours usually depending on the day, mostly 1 hour lately because I've been trying to finish some of my english books etc and only have an hour for chinese (and 1-2 extra for japanese depending on if I am doing the hobbies I'm doing in japanese that day). I think anything's better than nothing though. If you feel you want more immersion, make a schedule to look at what you do in a day/week and see where you could be doing japanese during the activity or replace something with a japanese activity etc. Even a little time each day will add up though and help you progress, even if its not always as much as you want.", "created_utc": "1611333849.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gk786d3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l2mghu", "parent_id": "t3_l2mghu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Congrats!

And that's been heavily cutting into my free time I normallly use to study. But it's been a relief when every few days I still have time to read a chinese novel chapter, and realize I am not forgetting anything. And just reading a paragraph or two on some days, reminds me I want to go back and make more time to do it for longer periods once I'm able again. That way I don't give up studying. \n\nIn the past, I used to think \"If I don't have time to read a full chapter/go through a full module in a course/listen to a full audio lesson, then its not even worth studying today\" and I'd get into that mindset so long I'd end up not studying for weeks. Or I'd think \"if it's not a challenge, its not enough\" which meant I'd avoid tasks I could do in the language, for weeks avoiding a language because I didn't have the energy to intensively study. After enough weeks, I would be forgetting stuff, and I'd also lose  the motivation to want to keep studying again.

What you've said helps me a lot, and its wonderful seeing your journey and how its been going so far doing this! Your study plan looks solid - from the little I've done so far, listening reading is well suited to improving listening and learning by listening. So its not necessary to really be diving deep into reading skills with it, unless you're trying to. \n\nI use the audio files of the spoonfed chinese deck too - I usually play them in the background when I can remember to and have time in a day. I found they helped me solidify my ability to recognize through listening a lot of words/phrase I already recognized when reading, and pick up some new words. I am not good at flashcards at all, so those audio files are a great medium ground for me.\n\nI also noticed what you noticed, I haven't done many hours yet. I might be picking up a few new words.  I'm mostly solidifying my ability to recognize in listening the words I could recognize when reading, and to comprehend full phrases and sentences instead of just recognizing the individual words. \n\nBefore I started listening reading, I would try to listen to audiobooks to practice. To compare my reading skills with listening at the time: when I extensively read a novel without any pop up dictionary I could usually follow the gist of the main plot and sometimes catch some finer details in sentences. And when I listened to an audiobook chapter I could pick up individual words I recognized and a handful of dialogue but otherwise could not figure out what was going on, unless I was trying to guess based on word I heard versus the chapter I'd already read that it was based on. My listening skills were noticeably worse.\n\nOnly maybe a handful of hours into listening reading, I could start actually recognizing a lot more of the words I sort-of-knew in that I knew them if reading, could start hearing the phrases said together instead of as separate words I couldn't 'figure out when heard together.' And after a little over a dozen hours I can start hearing some full sentences and following them except for a word or two, which is much closer to my reading ability. So its like you said - more than picking up 'new' words, I am mostly noticing my listening skills are improving and solidifying my recognition of words/phrases I 'somewhat' knew. I'm really curious if my amount of new words picked up will get bigger, once I get into dozens of hours, a hundred hours, etc. \n\nI am intensively reading a novel as another separate activity lately. So I'm looking up new words regularly when reading. So if I don't pick up very many new words from listening reading, I imagine that listening reading will help me solidly learn the words I'm 'kind of recognizing' as I see them in reading more.\n\nI have a method I also do 'similar' to listening reading. You might find it useful if you ever push into intensive or extensive reading. I do it when I'm 'less energetic'. For some reason for me, following along with the audio to match translation is a really intense energy activity to me, so when I'm tired listening reading is difficult. So, anyway, here's sort of a similar exercise I do. I have the Pleco app, and use the Reader tool. I will read a chinese chapter of a novel in Pleco Reader - either intensively where I look up words as needed (pleco has a pop up dictionary with the text/audio), or extensively where I just try to understand what I can. Sometimes I read all at once, sometimes I read for 5 minutes throughout the day. Then once I'm done with the chapter (or done with a page/section), I press the dictate button in Pleco. It will read the passage aloud from where I tell it to start, to either the end or til I tell it to stop. It will pause whenever I click pause. It highlights each word as it reads so its easy to follow along. It pops up the english definition as it highlights it, so I could glance at the english definitions if as I'm listening I forgot the meaning of one word. If I need a moment, I pause, really read that definition and look at the hanzi, then continue playing the dictation audio. So its sort of like Step 2 of the listening read method (chinese audio with chinese text), except I also have constant english popup definitions to refer to. I don't comprehend quite as much as with listening reading Step 3 (since the english translation is more comprehensible immediately). But I get some listening practice in, with mostly comprehensible input. \n\nAnd if I am Really lazy - and do not even want to Read very much that day... but still want to do a bit of listening practice. Then I will just play dictate, on a slower speed like 80%, read the english popups as it dictates and pause as needed to follow the gist (so mostly just listening/seeing the english to comprehend, very little heavy focus on the chinese text). And then I will re-play the audio again, trying to glance at the chinese mostly and follow along, and looking at the english definitions/pausing as needed to comprehend.  This is easier than reading intensively, and requires less focus from me than full Listening Reading since I don't have to keep track as much of where I'm at (the word's always highlighted, definition is always also visible), and I can pause easily/replay easily. If you get into reading chinese more, I find this is a nice way to incorporate more listening practice in with reading, or 'pre-read' a chapter so when you try to read it later without audio or the dictionary popups constantly you have a lot more context. \n\nI know what you mean about webnovels being so long. I currently want to Listen Read to Guardian/Zhenhun by priest, and I calculated it and it will take: 53 hours for the chinese audio-chinese text portion step 2, 53 hours for the chinese audio-english translation portion step 3, and probably half as long as it takes me to listen to read the chapters in english so 26.5 hours for step 1. So to finish this novel once will take probably around 132.5 hours. Just to make the time to do that novel itself is a large task. So what you've been doing - just re-listening to the first several chapters for the actual 'do the novel a few times' part, I may try that. \n\nI'm going to check out your post you linked! Thank you so much for it. I am very interested in the listening reading method and I've read a few forums of people talking about their experiences, but very few people have mentioned how it went when doing it with mandarin! And you've done so much! \n\nI have a blog where I just sort of journal on my experiences, so its somewhat a mess.

With chinese, I have a much higher tolerance of seeing unknown words than I'd expected lol. But it still took cramming like 2000 words in memrise, and then reading for months, before I felt like at least with simpler materials like tv shows and manhua and very simple webnovels I wasn't draining my energy trying to follow the main ideas and details. And for my favorite authors, who write more in depth, I am still lucky if I feel drained and just catch the main ideas if I read without a dictionary. So I am usually reading with a dictionary, and just using it to keep picking up more vocab until the day I know enough to feel its easier to focus less intensely lol. But its still huge progress over where I was! 8-10 months of study was probably the turning point for me, when I knew over 2000 words, and reading was still extremely draining but managing to grasp the main ideas became more doable and sometimes catching finer details became something I was able to start doing. So its been smoother since then. \n\nI'm 14 months into study now, and its still hard work reading, but it baffles me how in months 6-8 i managed to tolerate extensive reading and trying to follow the plot when now I know so many more words and know how much I Still need to pick up. I'm baffled I managed to tolerate the amount of ambiguity I did before. I imagine it will be probably another year or 2 before I have a big enough vocabulary that comprehension will become less of a hassle. \n\nI remember with shows it happened sooner - back in month 8 I could follow shows but it required intense focus from me, and pausing scenes to rewatch dialogue, etc. Now I can pop on most shows in genres I'm used to, and even if I half-pay attention and glance at my phone, I can follow the plot. So it feels easier and more like watching english my NL now. So eventually reading will follow and feel a bit easier.\n\nWhen I was studying French, it felt easier overall. I think 6 months into french, I felt as comfortable as I feel in chinese right now. And It was about 1.5-2 years of french when I felt I no longer needed to look up words when reading in order to feel comfortable and like it was not much of a struggle. Since then reading just kept feeling easier and easier. But again, I think I do have a pretty big tolerance on ambiguity. With french I started trying to read 3 months in only knowing maybe 500 words, which was a massive struggle, but still I felt it was tolerable for me to do. \n\nWhich is probably why 6 months into chinese I somehow managed to tolerate trying to read some excerpts of my favorite author's novels. Even though looking back, now that I actually CAN fully comprehend some of those passages without a dictionary fully (and translate them with a struggle), it baffles me how I managed to tolerate reading them and somehow managed to grasp the main idea from how little I could firmly easily understand. Like... nowadays I would never willingly choose to read something that comparatively hard for me lol. \n\nI think they say 90-98% comprehension is when it feels like less of a struggle to read/listen to things. Which is why graded readers etc can be nice for building vocabulary, if they don't bore you. They are usually comprehensible enough that they don't feel too challenging, and you can pick up vocab quickly then move onto the next level of challenging material. I did that in french and chinese a bit before jumping to real novels, to make the novels less of a leap in difficulty. Also - like you said, sticking to one genre/type of thing/author tends to help. Then there's more common vocab that keeps showing up, so over time that sort of material becomes more comprehensible and easier to tolerate without feeling its as much work.", "created_utc": "1610555602.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gj4kasi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kw149d", "parent_id": "t3_kw149d", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Its normal. I do what you do - when I read a novel intensively, I look up every word. I don't actually try to remember every word I look up, but I imagine you trying to probably helps you learn them faster! I notice that some words stick into my memory within 1-3 times of looking them up. Some I have to encounter 10-20 times, but eventually they stick in my memory too. And each time, they're a little more familiar, and as soon as I look them up again I realize \"oh yeah! I knew that one before!\" Generally after so many times, some quickly some slower, I pick them up. A few I do not pick up, but they still get more familiar each time. I usually put the most effort in trying to remember the words that keep popping up in a novel, that I keep Not recognizing. So words I have to look up 10-20 times - since the words that I remember within a few lookups I'm clearly learning, and the words that come up often but I still can't remember are clearly important and worth studying since they show up often and I'm struggling with them.\n\nFor me personally, this is kind of why I like extensive reading sometimes - where I don't use any dictionary lookup. I notice that when extensive reading, since I have no tool to rely on, a lot of the words I \"almost knew\" (that I was looking up 10-20 times but looked Super Familiar I just wasn't sure I remembered them) I end up understanding correctly in extensive reading. Maybe because I have to work harder to try and recall their meaning, since I need it more, so I am able to jog my memory on having seen their meaning before. \n\n I also think it's normal sometimes to have a word slip from your memory even if you've learned it - and then you manage to recall it and it comes back quick. Even in my native language, sometimes I forget words for a few hours or days then finally they click again - melancholy, carriage, acorn, vermillion, windowsill, controller, remote, modem, router, light switch, etc. So I imagine that happens a bit in any language - you know/knew a word, want to recall it even, and its just slipping your mind or you can't understand it but Knew you did before, and then eventually it clicks again. And like people have mentioned, we have active vocabulary and passive. I tend to remember words better 'actively' when I having a lot of conversations/producing a lot, I have a lot of words that come to mind much easier. When I'm producing less, sometimes there's words I know that I just don't recall as easily unless I start needing to talk more/reading something with those words.", "created_utc": "1610553486.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gj4fq8i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kwdd1z", "parent_id": "t3_kwdd1z", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I hope something in there ends up helping out your studies! ^-^\n\nI've never used chinesepod, so I don't know. But I think like most resources, if you keep working through it, it'll be useful! The biggest fallback i have early on no matter what, is just me bouncing between resources and plans and relearning basics over and over. I always need to just pick Something, even if its not perfect, and work through into harder and harder stuff. \n\nThat's why I did the plan I did, mostly. I mainly read the chinese-grammar.com, then went through the 2 memrise decks of 2000 common words, then brute force started watching chinese shows and reading chinese. Since I knew literally Doing what I wanted to do, would constantly challenge me and give me harder new material to learn until eventually you know.. I can just do it well enough to no longer feel I need to study. \n\nThe other stuff I studied after, were just tools I found that helped support those goals. Like... I found the pronunciation stuff because I noticed I didn't understand tone sandhi and needed more info, and because I was doing language exchanges on HelloTalk and felt SO BAD for my partners hearing me and wanted to improve so I'd sound a little more tolerable. What really pushed me through finishing studying those 2000 words was I was talking to people on HelloTalk and NEEDED more words asap to communicate without a dictionary (and I'm so lazy I don't wanna use one), and I was reading and it was a SLOG unless I just buckled down and kept progressing to learn more words. I did Spoonfed Chinese anki deck for a while, and eventually stopped because I had done enough that it was no longer noticeably making my reading easier. I just sort of keep trying to make sure I'm not re-studying things I already understand as much as I'm engaging with things teaching me new stuff I need to still learn.\n\nI do have a suggestion for you for an audio 'course' to use! It is free. I've been using it since September. I hate flashcards, and I also wanted to improve my listening skills (so I can listen to audio books/convos whatever). I found the audio for Chinese Spoonfed anki deck. Its just audio files in 20-30 minute chunks, of the anki deck sentences, in order from easiest common words and grammar, to less common words and grammar. I've been listening to it, and it gradually teaches new words while using some old words long enough to get some review. It teaches no grammar, since it's just sentence exposure/audio flashcards. So if Chinesepod teaches grammar, you could use chinesepod to supplement. (Although for grammar I really recommend nosediving and reading a grammar guide overview early, even if you plan to study grammar slower later, so you at least have an overview of what you'll see later and start picking up things you notice - at least, this is what works better for me... otherwise I just get confused too much). \n\nI really love the Chinese Spoonfed audio files, because they're practice listening to full sentences, I can follow along easily, I can shadow their pronunciation if I want, they use common words at first and it gets gradually more difficult, and it ends up covering thousands of words. \n\nWhich is the biggest thing for me - a lot of audio courses do not cover that many words (I remember reading one audio course maybe pimsleur taught 500 words or something per level, when you need to learn a lot more words to jump into starting to watch/listen/read things or even just communicate - 1000+ was when I could finally start catching the gist of some main ideas in media, and follow casual conversations on apps ok, and 2000+ when it stopped feeling intensely-difficult to grasp the gist lol). Basically - if you listen through these audio files, you will hear thousands of new words, and a lot of grammar structures. So even if you don't pick everything up, you're bound to learn some new material if you're a beginner. Its also helped me a ton because its audio of words I could read but maybe not identify well when listening - my listening has improved a ton since using them more.

Some stuff I did and used:\n\n- Read the full grammar guide on this website: http://www.chinese-grammar.com/\n\n- Use AllSetLearning's chinese grammar guide for specific grammar I notice later when studying chinese, that I still don't grasp: https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/\n\n- For sounds, pronunciation and tones. I greatly recommend dong-chinese's full free course on pinyin then tones, especially using their tone trainer. Its my favorite beginner pronunciation guide. It also considers tone sandhi (when tones change pronunciation in certain positions). I would recommend going to youtube afterward to look up tones more in depth, tone sandhi, and any pronunciation sounds you still aren't clear on after this course. Dong-chinese pinyin guide: https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin . Dong-chinese tone trainer: https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/toneTrainer . Dong-chinese sentence sounds: https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/speaking\n\n- Use anki (ankiweb.net is free, memrise website/app are free), and find a common words deck. Even better if you use a common words in sentences deck (like anki Spoonfed Chinese). To add decks to anki, you need to install the computer program and add them on the computer, then you can study the decks on your phone on the app or ankiweb.net website. For memrise, go to the website in a web browser to add any user-made decks, then the decks will be on the website or app for you to study. I just used these: https://app.memrise.com/course/374/chinese-words-by-spoken-frequency-0-1000/\nhttps://app.memrise.com/course/376/chinese-words-by-spoken-frequency-1001-2000/\nLater I used Spoonfed Chinese for a while.\n\n- Use something to start learning hanzi. Lots of options. I loved some books (which weren't free - one was Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters, book covers 800 basic hanzi with great mnemonics for meaning and tone/sound, after that I jumped into reading). I would also recommend just looking up articles about radicals - changed my life simply learning hanzi often have one radical implying sound, which helps me guess new word's spelling when looking them up. Free anki deck with mnemonics, only for meaning: simplified: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1219175376\ntraditional: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1881616382\nWebsites also have hanzi information, like hanzicraft: https://hanzicraft.com/\n\n- Pleco dictionary app. The base version is free. Use it for dictionary and reading. You can look up a ton of words, or go to clipboard reader and paste in any chinese text and it will: dictate the passage aloud, read any specific word you click, give you the definition of any word within. Its a fantastic app. I recommend buying the 20ish dollar one time fee upgrade - it includes an even Bigger expanded dictionary, and the Reader feature. The Reader can open up websites, most documents, and allow you to read them in Pleco. I use the click-dictionary and dictate passage feature in Pleco Reader constantly, its how I've been reading novels. The Reader part itself was I think $10 as a one time purchase, and well worth it for me. I don't remember if the base version has flashcards, but mine does and so i could also theoretically sentence mine, save anything in this app as a flashcard, import other people's decks they've shared online, etc. \n\n- Other misc dictionaries as desired. I have Baidu Translate app, works great for sentences, bigger phrases, paragraphs, and when I only have audio/am speaking out a phrase I heard. I also have Google Translate, because when I'm watching shows it can recognize the hanzi I draw into it the easiest of all my apps. Then if google gives me a weird word translation, I can paste the text it recognized I drew into a different app for a better translation. Likewise: install the chinese keyboard on phone/computer so you can look things up easier.\n\n- Now you have the internet. Immerse. Look up Chinese dramas and donghua on youtube, viki, iqiyi, etc. Look up novels - if you type a novel you know of's chinese name, plus '\u5c0f\u8bf4\u5728\u7ebf' (novel online), or plus 'txt,' you will easily find a ton of webnovels. If you have no idea What you want to read/watch? Go to mydramalist.com, or novelupdates.com, and browse genres you're interested in to find things you might like. Also you may find some things you like have a chinese version - How To Get Away with Murder is chinese dub/subbed on netflix, Pride and Prejudice has a english/chinese novel parallel text online, Sherlock Holmes is online in english/chinese, etc. I started getting into chinese to read untranslated novels, so mostly I look up novels and read them with Pleco Reader tool. Or watch shows in chinese with chinese subs, now that I've gotten interested in so many.\n\n- When you're ready, there's a ton of audiobooks online too. Ximalaya app and website (https://www.ximalaya.com/) have immense amounts of audiobooks for free. Youtube has a lot. Once you know the chinese name of a book, simply googling 'name' plus '\u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269' (audiobook) will usually find you an audiobook if one exists.\n\n- There are also a ton of structured courses if you would prefer a structured study plan already made. There are ones on Coursera for free, a lot of the \"Basic Mandarin\" and \"Intermediate Mandarin\" ones are good, as are HSK 1-6 ones. If you belong to a college, university, or local library, check their e-library. There are usually a Ton of free language textbooks you can read through the library, so you could pick one you like and work through it.\n\nMake goals, look for resources based on your goals. The internet has a ton of free stuff to learn mandarin (and a ton of paid stuff).", "created_utc": "1610487746.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gj1mocy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kvycn9", "parent_id": "t3_kvycn9", "score": "110", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "My doctor did say, if you have a good obgyn, pregnancy might need closer monitoring but should still go smoothly! \n\nI also have a complete septum with 2 sides, mine are exactly the same size though so?

I think, if you stick to any plan, you will see progress. If you stick to the plan you already have, you will cover grammar (Tae Kim, Tango decks), you will cover kanji (sentence mining/immersion), you will cover listening/reading (immersion). \n\nThat said, when I was a beginner I took 1 japanese class before I dived into my own self study plan. The teacher used Genki, and we did Every Exercise in the book. We listened to the dialogues beforehand, then listened while read, then tried to shadow and were graded on the pronunciation, listened to the vocabulary and read them, read the grammar, did the listening and writing drills. Genki, if used fully, is designed to cover listening/reading/speaking/writing and build all 4 main skills at the same time. And it did work - all of them progressed at a similar rate, and I was left with a very good foundation. Particularly all the listening exercises I did - it was listening comprehensible input I got a ton of, and I wouldn't have listened-only to so much japanese if I hadn't been doing it at the time. Afterwards, I continued to study through self study - mainly anki/memrise decks and immersion, and my reading/listening improved but my writing/speaking stagnated. I think that's fine, since when immersing if you're doing it the refold way, you don't really work on production until later on anyway. And you don't work on perfecting production until later on.\n\nGenki was very good for building a foundation in all 4 skills I could rely on, and is probably best suited to learners who have no solid self study plan or idea of where to start, because it provides all the structure and activities in all 4 areas. \n\nBecause you already have a self study plan, that is addressing grammar, vocabulary, sentences, listening, reading, and immersion - you're not going to need Genki. (Assuming you don't care about any production skills until later on). You are already covering grammar with Tae Kim, and reading/listening with sentence mining and immersion. Genki would simply provide you more of that in the slow format of a very structured textbook. Since you're already covering those areas, studying Genki is just studying more of the same. That said - different grammar explanations and content presentation \"clicks\" better for different people. For some people, Tae Kim is confusing and impossible for them to follow, but imabi.net is perfect, or Genki's grammar explanations are easier. For people who can't stand immersion with so little comprehensibility, having all of Genki's learner-made listening/reading material to practice and develop a basis to jump from into immersion is useful - for me, I really appreciated the solid listening base I had after genki, it made manga and youtube videos way less intimidating than they were before I went through it. But absolutely any learner-tailored material will provide something like this benefit - including Tango decks.\n\nAfter I used genki, I moved onto Nukemarine's LLJ memrise decks (tae kim/kanji/6k core stuff), Tae Kim, and immersion. That worked fine for the most part so I only used books are personal reference after.\n\nBasically - you can go through Genki, it has useful information and presents it in a way some people find useful. But you also already are covering the same material in your current plan, so its not necessary.\n\nYou might want to look into various japanese textbooks, if you DO want to use one, and see which ones teach WHAT you want to learn/build the skills you Want to build right now, are written a way you like. As said - Genki is great for ppl who want a foundation in all four reading, writing, speaking, listening skills if they actually do Every exercise. I personally look for books that cover more information in 1 volume - so I like Tae Kim, since a ton is covered in a single book. Some people like Assimil, because its very conversation/listening focused. I like the books I've bought: Japanese in 30 Hours (ungodly old but interesting), Japanese Sentence Patterns for Effective Communication, Essential Japanese Grammar. \n\nJapanese in 30 Hours because its short, to the point, and focused on teaching reliable simple communication skills and a bunch of common keywords - its basically a nice little crash course, and the grammar is simple to follow. Japanese Sentence Patterns because it covers Examples of all the sentence patterns, and helps me see grammar IN action, Vocabulary IN context, in a lot of ways fills in the gaps Tae Kim left me confused with, and is sort of like a big sentence mined book of comprehensible input I can read instead of flashcards (I hate flashcards a ton, I focus very badly on them). And Essential Japanese Grammar because it covers most any grammar I need, straightforward, in a simple single volume of reference - it also has a ton of common words in it, so I can study from that list and it's examples when I can't get myself to focus on flashcards for common words. These books, for me, fill a personal study need my flashcards and immersion don't meet as well. So I use them. But they aren't necessary, they just help me personally understand. Whether or not a particular book will be helpful depends a lot on what you need and want. I loved Genki as an intro, but after that class I never used it again - it presented information way too slowly for me, and the grammar guides I got and flashcards for vocabular covered information WAY faster which was more challenging but what I preferred.", "created_utc": "1610485201.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gj1h47a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kw0612", "parent_id": "t3_kw0612", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Refold", "subreddit_id": "t5_3azein"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Challenging myself - trying to do things I find difficult, trying to do them again, planning challenging goals.

Thank you for the experience and advice! I wonder if they have cerelle in my area. I have 2 uteruses too, I found out when I was maybe 20 and tried to get the iud.

I freaked, since I'd tried hormone bc pills before and reacted so terribly. My doctor recently tried me on the mini pill, but I still had a slew of awful reactions. I'm curious if the one you use might work better for me, I'll ask her.

I'm just curious if you had any extra issues specifically because of the 2 uteruses. \n\nI have immensely painful periods, they get handled with abdomen muscle relaxers, lots of pain killer, super hot baths for hours, etc. I've had ultrasounds and my doctor thought I might have endometriosis, but I have no cysts or any noticeable issues in any exams/tests, just very painful periods. She said maybe its because there's 2 uteruses, or maybe just because some people's are really bad. Likewise, she thinks my bad reactions to all the bc pills we've tried including the mini pill is me being more sensitive to hormone side effects than some ppl. As far as I know, the only issues the 2 uteruses mean for me are I can not get an iud, and if I got pregnant the pregnancy would be higher risk.

I've been flipping between many books, and I'd like to stick with one all the way through.\n\n- Listening-Reading Method \u9547\u9b42 by Priest, the novel that got my interested in chinese ;-; I am excited for this, and starting it soon. I've done a couple months of listening reading method and its helped a ton already on dragging my listening comprehension up to be closer to my reading comprehension, so I'm excited to see where I'll be after I complete a whole book. Also, reading the chinese chapters will be some good extensive-reading practice for me since the other novels I've been reading I've been intensively reading (looking every unknown word up). I roughly checked how many hours listening-reading to Zhenhun will be, and it looks like 130ish hours. I think the biggest challenge with this goal will mainly be making time for it consistently.\n\n- Ideally: Read through several books this year - either intensively or extensively. I have a lot of novels I want to read, and I think the more I do it, hopefully the faster I'll get at doing it lol. So the goal is - keep count of how many chapters read, books read, audio chapters listened to. I really want to expand my vocabulary a bit, and improve both my reading skill and reading speed. \n\n- Longer term: read through one of my chinese grammar books to solidify/correct anything I didn't grasp well, use my putonghua pronunciation app, and get on language exchange apps more and focus on/practice production more. Reading/Listening is my primary goal this year, so I don't know when I'll get to this production goal, it may be for 2022.\n\nJapanese:\n\n- Listen through all of pimsleur (quicksleur) japanese. Refresh my memory from a couple years ago the last time I studied.\n\n- Finish reading Japanese in 30 Hours - an old book I quite loved, but never finished.\n\n- Listen through all of japanse audio lessons (japaneseaudiolessons.com has lovely lessons, and really nice books for learning kanji readings). I was in the process of this 2 years ago and remember it improving me a lot, I didn't finish back then.\n\n- Resume playing video games in japanese, like I was able to start doing a couple years ago, once I've done the steps above. Intention is to just keep reinforcing/maintaining what I've learned, and possibly pick up new words and look them up as I hear them.\n\n- Idea: try to re-learn the things I had known a couple years ago, right when I was just starting to really read/listen and comprehend things. I gave up japanese just when I was starting to make some real progress. So I'd like to refresh my memory, re-learn those old basics, and do it focusing mainly on listening. 1. Because my listening skills I didn't used to focus on as well as I do now with Chinese, 2. Because I am reading Chinese so constantly right now, and I don't want re-learning/learning kanji to confuse me with my Chinese hanzi recognition, not until I feel my Chinese is much firmer. So I would like to re-pick up what I used to know, then mainly immerse in japanese and resume somewhat the activities I used to be doing in japanese. Later on, probably not until 2022, I'd like to then switch my japanese study plan to incorporate novels and kanji study - I want to do that whenever I feel my chinese reading is solid enough that I won't worry it will be affected. So far, this plan is going quite good! Just listening, I've already remembered a number of grammar points I used to know but had forgotten - verb endings, particle uses, key words. I still remember kana so looking words up in the dictionary is easy, and I remember kanji when they're in words getting refreshed in my memory.\n\n- Long Long term: probably not until 2022+, unless my chinese improves much faster than expected. I'd like to go back to completing Nukemarine's LLJ memrise decks. I remember doing half of them years ago, before I dropped japanese, and simply those in combination with immersion was improving my comprehension immensely. I think going back to finish it, and actually including novels and listening more this time around, would do wonders.", "created_utc": "1610467450.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gj0e4s8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kpum1a", "parent_id": "t3_kpum1a", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I'm not as far as you in learning, but yes your idea to start practicing more by simply watching without subtitles sounds like a good plan. Part of the difficulty is just needing to practice more, and it will become easier. Especially since you already comprehend well with subtitles, so you know the words well enough. I practice listening more with audio books and audio dramas, so its all on my listening. Any listening-focused activity should show you improvement in it, so watching shows without subtitles will definitely give you improvement.\n\nI've found the Listening-Reading Method really helpful, you may want to look into it. (There's some summaries on reddit, and a huge site on it). Summary: you have target language audio, you have a novel in portuguese and english, read the english - or just the portuguese if you already understand it all - to have context, then read the portuguese while listening to the portuguese audio making a point to just try to use the text to note where words end/sentences end/what sounds are what, then play the portuguese audio and use the english text to follow along and just glance at for a meaning when you can't catch a word or phrase etc. Since you are advanced in portuguese, you could likely cut the english out entirely and use only the prtuguese text to follow along. Same steps would apply: read once so you have context, then read once while listening to the audio primarily focusing on the sounds and where words/phrases/sentences end/what they look like versus sound like, then listen to the audio focusing on comprehending it and just glancing at the text to keep track of where you are and get clarification on the things you can't comprehend when you hear them. I've been doing both variations of this with chinese (using english to help, or just doing the entire process in chinese - which takes me a bit longer than it'd take you just since my initial readthrough I need to look more words up lol). Since I started doing it, I've noticed my ability to hear and recognize the words I 'knew' when reading them has gone way up, and is now much closer to my reading ability. \n\nAt its core its basically like listening with a transcript you can reference to comprehend any unknown words, while focusing on the audio. And depending on how you do it, you can strengthen reading skills a bit alongside listening - although its primarily to improve listening skills. I've been doing it for a couple of months, because I noticed just listening to audio more was helping me so I wanted to try out an actual structured study plan with audio and so I tried out reading-listening method. Within these few months my ability to hear words/phrases I already knew if I'd had subtitles/were reading them, has gotten much better. To the point where watching shows without subs now seems much less daunting, since even when I watch now I'm starting to pick up what I hear before I even finish reading the target language subs.\n\nEdit: If you did want to look into listening-reading method (with your level of understanding though, listening to shows or audiobooks or podcasts will work great too, l-r method's just sort of fun if you already read a ton lol).

I was beginning to study japanese, so I would look up japanese study resources in french. I remember also looking at the french Assimil book for japanese too - which looked useful, I just did not click with using assimil. \n\nIt was fine. I also studied japanese using english teaching material, so I just sort of used both french and english learning material. After a while I just switched to english teaching materials though, because they were easier to find and the kind I wanted to use (Nukemarine's memrise decks, anki decks, etc). Also, I was reading/doing other things in french regularly, so using french resources to study japanese wasn't exposing me to particularly more french than I would have normally seen. \n\nI think if you want to use the resource, and can understand the resource, its useful - like you mentioned having a specific french resource for studying japanese in mind.

I experienced something similar with Chinese. I really wanted to learn to read, since in French that\u2019s really when I started improving more, and I wanted to read so many specific Chinese novels. I kept trying from month 3, and failed but it helped me set goals. Finally in month 8 I could start comprehending the main idea gist without a dictionary, and with a dictionary (like a pop up dictionary tool) I could read in a reasonable amount of time. That was really a huge point for me. I was so excited, and since then my comprehension without a dictionary has continued improving, and I\u2019ve been able to keep picking up new vocabulary with a dictionary as I read which has been very fun! It\u2019s one of my favorite ways to study, and just something I wanted to do very badly - read in chinese even if I needed a dictionary - and it\u2019s exciting to do it now. \n\nSo I get reading being a nice milestone, even reading with tools. I used to study Japanese for 2.5 years, and didn\u2019t make any real progress past beginner until 2 years in, because that\u2019s when I finally started trying to Read manga and play video games in Japanese. I started finally comprehending the gist of main ideas, improving noticeably. Since 2.5 years in, I abandoned Japanese study. I am just now starting to pick it up again and relearn what I knew before. And I\u2019m very excited to push myself to try reading again once I know enough. I think with any language I\u2019ve studied, pushing myself to read, challenging myself, has helped me goal set and helped me improve a lot. And I think sometimes you don\u2019t need to be as prepared as you think you do. With Japanese, I really could have tried to read after 1 year and wasted less time with the \u201cslow progress\u201d I was making. But I kept being afraid reading would be \u201ctoo hard\u201d and put it off. So I didn\u2019t challenge myself until 2 years in, and saw such rapid progress in the months right after I started. That\u2019s why with Chinese I tried to read so much so early on, and kept trying that goal so I could see when I was ready/what else I needed. I knew the sooner I started being able to read at least with a dictionary at a reasonable speed to myself, the sooner I\u2019d get to a point I could build that skill up. I am getting to the point now where I should probably start extensive reading more soon, without a dictionary, since I think I can handle the challenge much better than I could at month 8 lol! But happily, the reading I do where I look words up is growing my vocabulary, so it\u2019s helpful and it may not matter too much when I push into more extensive reading.\n\nYour 100 hours of study is really motivating as I said! I don\u2019t know how long it took me to read manhua in chinese, but I did start in my first year.

Attempt to finish a few novels, whether I'm reading intensively or extensively. Most importantly - count how many chapters and novels I read. Read through one of my hanzi books just for more solid foundations. \n\nOptional Listening goals: listen to the audiobooks of things I'm reading, count how many chapters I listen to. Watch some shows in only chinese - count how many eps, ideally I actually get through a few full shows (because I have a habit of skipping around to new shows constantly). Keep using my pronunciation app and strive to get consistent scores within the 90% region, to improve my problem areas, and to practice speaking full sentences/paragraphs more.\n\nThis past year I learned a lot about how I learn/work better.

So ultimately, at least I'll probably still be able to count 'chapters read' if I fail to finish a book in 2021 lol!

I figured it would take 4 years lol... but thanks to pop-up dictionary tools, and faster progress then expected, I might just be able to read one of their novels in 2021. Maybe even the one that got me into this lol. It already seems within my reach! I'm reading one of their more easy-written novels \u5929\u6daf\u5ba2, in chapter 3, and its been going fine. So theoretically I should be capable of finishing one of their novels now. The novel is one of their shortest - 77 chapters, instead of 100-200 chapters like most of them ToT. So I might be able to finish this one if I make time for 1 chapter a day. The chapters only take 15-30 minutes to read, I just haven't had reading time lately... right now I'm reading 2 chapters a week due to lack of time. Long term dream goal: to finish this easier novel by them, and move onto their harder novels that I already love the translations of: \u9547\u9b42 and \u9ed8\u8bfb. I'm not sure if I'll get to them in 2021 though. But they're what sucked me into learning, so even just the fact I can read a chapter or two of them now is so motivating to me.\n\nFor the most part, my overall goals are just keep doing what I've been doing and keep count of what I do so I can make sure I continue to be consistently studying.

You won't have as much time as other people - maybe just reading for 20 minutes a day (or a few hours a week), watching japanese (even if its just short youtube vids or one ep a week), and listening to japanese a few hours a week in the background when you do other things.

So if what you're doing is working for you, its fine. When I have a physical book, I usually just read and try to get the main idea, and look up words if they seem important to follow the plot, or if I'm curious. Then I look it up again if it confuses me again, until I remember it. And I'll reread an old chapter/story a few weeks later, and see if I understood more without looking as much up. \n\nIf its a digital book, I read in Pleco Reader - click any unknown word for the definition and pronunciation, and click 'save' so I can find it later if I want. Then after one read through a chapter, I'll re-read while listening to pleco audio and follow along to see how much words I looked up I retained. Then move on to the next chapter. And like with a physical book, a month or so later I might go back to an older chapter and try to read again and see if I can look less words up this time. You could also use a bunch of different Reader tools, Pleco is just what I like. I like just looking up words until I start remembering them - which takes 1-3 lookups if its a word with hanzi I know, and anywhere from 5-20 lookups usually if its a word with new hanzi. \n\nPleco also has the ability to save sentences or phrases as you read, make them into flashcards, and put in definitions yourself. So it could be used for sentence mining flashcards. I just do not do that, unless I want to save a sentence or odd phrase to look at later in my 'saved' list - since I don't usually use flashcards.\n\nI think there's more efficient ways then mine, I just hate using flashcards so I avoid them. I've seen some people run their reading material through Chinese Text Analyzer, which I think generates a list of unknown words in the text you can study ahead of time. Then you can make flashcards, put it into anki, and study those efficiently either before you read or as you read, to make the reading go by smoother and to help pick up words faster.", "created_utc": "1607621561.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gfawb9u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kaff1o", "parent_id": "t3_kaff1o", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Everyone's already given solid advice. I wanted to add that if you want some learning material suggestions to start with, I used the following books for my first hanzi/vocabulary and I thought they were helpful. As a beginner, specifically the book Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters: https://www.amazon.com/Tuttle-Learning-Chinese-Characters-Revolutionary-ebook/dp/B00KV1SK1E . The book teaches 800 hanzi including main meanings and pinyin, a decent amount of frequent words and early HSK words, and its specific mnemonic story structure I found worked well for me. Also unlike some of the books listed below, this had mnemonics for every single hanzi. Took a month or two to pick up 400 hanzi from the book, then I went to just learning vocabulary generally. I found that book very useful. \n\nAfter that I used anki decks, textbooks, words looked up when reading etc. Of the anki decks, one was 3018 Simplified Chinese Hanzi Mnemonic deck: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1219175376 . There's also a traditional hanzi version of the deck. I added pinyin so I could study that too, and learned about 500 more hanzi with that after I already had somewhere over 1000 well grasped from previous learning materials or the words I'd learned while reading. After that, going back to picking up hanzi while learning words went pretty smoothly. That is what I do now. \n\nThere are also the books: Reading and Writing Chinese: Third Edition, HSK All Levels - I have this book, and while its more like a reference book, it has a lot of useful information. It has example vocabulary, stroke order, main meanings. The only thing I didn't like is about halfway through it shows the rest of the hanzi with much less details about them. Alan Hoenig's Chinese Characters: Learn & Remember 2,178 Characters and Their Meanings - I like this book a lot, as it includes mnemonics and pinyin for each hanzi, and worked well as a secondary resource to help me remember hanzi when I learned them in words if some were not sticking in my memory. Heisig's Chinese Characters - I have not used this book but some people have and found it helpful, I've glanced at this book and its also more of a secondary resource to help you recognize/remember hanzi, but I found the other books mentioned better for including pinyin too/vocabulary too/stroke order/mnemonics or something to help with memory for more hanzi.", "created_utc": "1607614608.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gfaepkc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ka2rw6", "parent_id": "t3_ka2rw6", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Good job on doing it and trying!

You may want to look into extensive versus intensive reading if you have not done so before. In short, extensive reading is when you read material you mostly comprehend and can pick up new words in context which will generally feel easy, and intensive reading is when you read material that has enough unknown words to be difficult and look up each unknown word.\n\nI like to do a little bit of both, but a more 'relaxed' version. So this is not the definitions of those reading activities, but more my way of doing something similar to them. I like to read things I mostly comprehend, and try to follow the gist and if I grasp the main idea then that is enough - so I forgive myself if I don't catch every detail. And for those, I will occasionally look up unknown words if I can't figure them out from context and they seem to keep appearing/be important for meaning/I'm curious. That is my 'extensive' reading since I don't have to look up words too often. Then my 'intensive' reading is when I read something and do look up all, or at least most, unknown words - especially any word appearing more than once or that seems to be an important point. When I read I usually do one of these. My version of 'extensive' reading tends to be more challenging since I can't find super comprehensible novels, but I find the challenge to understand as much as I can without looking up very much is very fun. (And can be done easier with graded readers, or novels truly at your reading level). \n\nAnd I find intensive reading improves my vocabulary and reading level by leaps whenever I do a significant amount of it - but its more draining. I can make it easier by picking a novel I comprehend decently (and could maybe follow the main plot without a dictionary), and then looking up all unknown words in it (since its easier it will have a managable number of words to look up). When I want to challenge myself for intensive reading, I pick a novel decently harder than I'm used to, but at a reading level I'd like to eventually get to.\n\nI generally don't write down words, I just look them up. In my reader app, I can click for a definition and click 'save' so that in the future it will be in my bookmarks of saved words I can review if desired, and so I'll see if I've looked it up before. That usually reminds me a word is familiar, so I work harder to recognize it. My reader app also can play audio. So the first few times I look up a word, I listen to its pronunciation too. Sometimes, when I have time, I will read through a chapter or section. Then I will play the audio and read through again by following along with the audio - trying to just match sound to text and remember the meaning of what I've just read (so trying to remember all the new words). \n\nAnd a fun learning method I found recently is called the Listening-Reading Method. If you have time, I encourage you to read into it and look up how various people have done it. (This is the masterpost, but there's a lot of shorter explanations out there, and forums of people who've tried it out different ways: http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm) I really enjoy that it gives me a productive way to add more listening practice into my reading - since I enjoy reading. And it gives me a way to make english translations of stories a tool I can use while studying. It has 3 basic steps, but you can do step 2 and 3 in either order, and in a few different ways. Step 1: Pick a story you're familiar with in a language you understand, or read it in a language you understand. Since you need to get familiar with it. (Aka. Read the chapter in english). Step 2: Play the audiobook in your target language, while reading it in your target language, making an effort to follow along with the audio and match the text you see to the sounds. This is to help get used to hearing when words end, how phrases sound, where sentences end, language sounds. During this step, I sometimes will read once in my target language at my own pace to lookup all unknown words, then a second time while following along to the audio. This way I know all the words. But that's up to the learner - this step is just about matching sound to text and noticing where words end etc, so you don't need to understand it all. Step 3: Listen to the target language audiobook, while looking at the english translation like a transcript. Attempt to follow the meaning of everything you hear, using the translation text to look up any unknown words as you hear them, and to keep up with the audio's pace. For this step it is important to focus on listening, the english translation is just for you to reference. \n\nThen after this, you can go back to step 2 if desired - which I do sometimes, since by then I'll know most of the meaning, so I'll be able to match a lot of the audio by then to the target language text and pick up some new words in reading. Then you can go to the next chapter/text chunk and repeat the process. Like I mentioned, you can do step 2 or 3 first, and repeat them a few times as desired. \n\nI have found that as basic as step 3 sounds at first - it has helped my listening comprehension tremendously since I've started doing it! It also takes a ton of focus - since the audio does not match the translation, I find it takes effort to keep track of what I'm listening to enough to try to keep it matched to the same spot in the story that matches in the english translation. Its a fun way to improve listening skills, and convenient if you already have an english translation and want a way to incorporate it into studying.\n\nMeanwhile, I think step 2 on its own is a solid reading plan. When I'm not feeling as energetic, I'll read a chapter of something (either just following the main idea, or looking up all unknown words, depending on how hard it is and what I feel like), then I will reread while keeping up with the audiobook. That way I get some practice reading at speaking speed, re-reading words/sentences I've just understood to help me remember them better, and that way I get a little listening practice in too. I find the Listening-Reading Method's step 2 is key though if you want to improve reading skills, since overall the Listening-Reading Method seems structured to improve listening skills mostly - which is why step 3 is the only 'necessary' step if you plan to do it the way it was originally suggested to be done by the person who discusses it. \n\nI've found it very fun, although intense, and its been really good for pulling my listening comprehension up. It's also just fun because I can pick a story I love or want to read, and get to read it in english so I know exactly what's going on, in chinese the way it was written, and I get to listen to it both by following along with the chinese text, and by having the english translation as a guide so over time I understand a large amount of the audio. So I get to enjoy the stories I like, while also noticing I'm getting better at picking up my favorite author's phrases, or recognizing when a scene I like is happening, etc. And like I mentioned - even if you only do step 2, you can still sort of enjoy it this way.\n\nI think your plan to write down unfamiliar words and notes is useful! If I did that, I think I'd improve faster tbh. It sounds nice to have a list you can reference later to study from or just see your progress, and so you don't have to break the flow of reading to look words up - just saving word look up until after, if you want to sometimes. \n\nI have a friend who uses novels to study by translating. This is the way they make progress, and they seem to enjoy it. They will have an novel in their target language, then have the text open in a file (or written), and look up any unknown words and write/type the translation next to the original word. If there's any idioms etc those are handled similarly. The sentence will still be in target language grammar. Then they'll read the sentence knowing all the meanings, determine what it means. Then they'll write it in english in a way that makes sense grammatically. Then finally they'll reword it in a way that sounds better. \n\nTheir example. :\u4eba\u306f\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u6642\u4ee3(era)\u3082\u4e16\u754c(world)\u3082\u9078\u3076\u3053\u3068\u306f\u51fa\u6765\u306a\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057(however)\u3001\u3069\u3046\u751f\u304d\u308b\u304b\u3092\u6c7a\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u51fa\u6765\u308b. Then: The era people are born in, and world, cannot not be chosen. But, how (they) live can be chosen. (Rough translation) \nThen: People cannot choose the era and world they are born in. However, they can choose how they live. (cleaned up and presentable translation).\n\nDoing translations is how they prefer to study with novels. They usually get a solid base of vocabulary and grammar before they start doing this.", "created_utc": "1607458546.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gf37u21", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k8lz2y", "parent_id": "t3_k8lz2y", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I agree with all of what you wrote above. \n\nI do think the general idea of the 80-20 principle is a good starting place for beginners sometimes, if they have no particular plan already/direction they know works for them. I took German for 2 years, Spanish for 2 years, Chinese for 1 year, growing up in school, and got As, and learned and retained nothing. I tried to self study Japanese for 4 years and learned kana but nothing else. It was only once I did start finding the advice \"look up common words, so you can boost how much you comprehend then start learning more words with context\" that I made any progress. \n\nThe advice to learn 1-2k common words - and then basically come up with a study plan to meet your needs. Which for me was read a lot, watch a lot, look up words and have conversations and do grammar books more from that point, helped me finally start making actual progress in learning a language. Before - I'd just learned who knows how many words in classes, and some grammar points, but not in any way that made trying to read the news achievable, or a book, or watching a movie. I found that for me, doing things in the language is what gets me to study/improve the most, but I just never could reach those points before. Once I did start prioritizing \"learn common words asap\" then I could start making actual progress. It's like the example above \"I would like to order a glass of ___.\" With 2 years of German classes I would recognize phrases I memorized in class, but never recognize sentences with common words in orders I was not used to. When I started actually making sure I learned common words, then I could start seeing paragraphs as \"ok I need to look up the key words for Meaning to understand this\" instead of \"I need to look up everything because I can only recognize 'today' and beginner phrases.\" \n\nIn french, that advice is the core thing that pushed me from knowing nothing to ultimately learning to read whatever I wanted. With Chinese, that advice helped begin my learning and gave me a foundation (along with the grammar guide I studied early on), to build from. That foundation made pushing into reading in 8 months in chinese something doable, and now I get to learn a lot of my words from reading novels - which was the biggest reason I wanted to learn to begin with. I thought it would take me years to get to this point (and it will still take years to reach my goals, I just am excited I can study the ways I enjoy most more quickly). I know in school, when my textbook for chinese only had maybe 300 unique words a year, it would have taken quite a while. So for me, the advice to \"learn common things asap, so that you can start Doing things and building up from that common base by studying what you need Next for the things you want to do next\" has been something I'm glad I stumbled into as a beginner. It certainly does NOT get you to mastery in a language, it might only really get you to mid beginner. What that advice did give me, was a solid suggestion of a place to start that would actually make a noticeable difference in a few months to a year. Whereas before, I'd been hitting walls of only being able to learn 'tourist' type phrases over periods of years before, because that's all I'd known how to follow. That advice also helped me to start planning my study plans in terms of prioritization. \n\nSo now, when I'm making my own study plans, I can think \"I want to be able to talk to my friends about hobbies, movies, directors, actors, genres, I should look up all those common words related to those topics so that I'll be able to follow most of my friend's convo and should be looking out for key words we talk about that'll be useful to me\" like the word \"recommendation\" and the slang for \"hot/popular\" that pop up a lot in convos but weren't words I could easily prepare and find ahead of time. Or much earlier on, with Chinese, I thought \"what do I need to learn to look up less words per page when reading?\" It started with a common word list. Then after I started reading, looking up the words that kept popping up in a story - key words for understanding its meaning (not details I could afford to skip), and usually words that I then start seeing elsewhere and hearing elsewhere. Then once that's more managable, all the detail words. Then I pick up a new book, possibly a new genre, and do the same. Generally picking stories on things I want to know how to be able to follow the topics of in the future. And right now, I'm reading an easier novel by an author I ideally want to read the more difficult novels of one day - because hopefully the many words I'll pick up, will be words this author's style will use in their other novels, making those harder ones more approachable in the future. I don't think I'm wording it well but... just the concept of 'try to think about what things will give you a base in your goal to build from' has really helped me structure my study plans better.", "created_utc": "1607454344.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gf2ysm1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k90cbc", "parent_id": "t3_k90cbc", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Memrise is a flashcard app. Its not everyone's ideal, but the way it shows you progressing through a deck was visually really motivating to me.

And the words have stuck in my memory, even though I struggle to remember flashcards.\n\nAnki - the app is free or paid depending on the phone you have use. Ankiweb.net is free either way to use in your phone browser. Another flashcard app. I love ankiweb.net, and anki has a ton of users who have made amazing flashcard decks for studying. You need to install anki on the computer to upload decks, but once they're uploaded you can study completely on the phone. I also learned a lot using this app - the simple layout is both great because you can work faster, and was demotivating to me because I didn't see clear visuals of how much progress I made each day. So a bit more self-motivation requirement. Overall I love it.\n\nClozemaster - an srs cloze sentences study tool, feels like a game. Presents mostly simple sentences with common words, and gradually goes through to less common words. Uses sentences from tatoeba I think (so some errors/non-literal translations). Overall its great if you want to pick up common words in sentence context, don't want to go looking for flashcard decks/make one (which just means some occasional weird sentences you'll want to mark-ignore as you go through the app), and want that visual motivation. It shows percent done, has you study an x amount sentences, and that can help when you want to get yourself to study each day even when busy, and want to see what you've done that day. I also think its more suited to learners who have some knowledge, but need to push up into B levels/intermediate. The sentences can be a bit intimidating at first as a total beginner (although doable if you want to). I've usually used this after some prior beginner experience, and it helped push up my reading skills. I've been using this a lot recently, since it pairs well with my other study activity - reading novels. When I don't have time to read a chapter, or when I have to chip through a chapter for a few days, I can still get on here and see some new words/some review in a few minutes and see how many words I've seen/studied.\n\nIdiom - a free reader app for the phone. It has a web browser in it, you can then look up word definitions as you read. I've used it for french before, and has many languages. It was helpful with getting through reading material.

I use the Reader tool inside the app everyday, it has a web browser and the ability to import files. So I can just open whatever I'm reading, click definitions if I need them, click audio, save things to pleco's built in flashcards and lists. Pleco itself has really good dictionaries, and a ton more features. It's pay model is 'one time purchases of feature' but a lot of the features have free base versions that are perfectly useable. It's free dictionary is good, and it has a \"Clipboard Reader\" section where you can paste in any text and click for definitions/save words/listen to audio. Free or purchased, its been better for chinese reading than Idiom.\n\nGoogle Translate, and Baidu Translate - its just convienient having a dictionary app I can open and look things up on when watching a show or reading a physical book. Also - Deepl.com, you have to open it in the phone's web browser since I think it has no app, but its nice too.\n\nTandem or Hellotalk - language exchange apps. Good for practicing with people, and chatting more regularly in the language you're learning.\n\nYoutube, iqiyi, viki - free streaming apps basically, so not study specific but they can be useful for watching content in the language you're learning.

Also Idiom is only usable on a phone, since it's an app. \n\nGenerally, I love the concept of LingQ - tools that allow people to read in their target language with the support of dictionary lookup.

That worked ok for me and kept me motivated. After that I primarily picked up vocab through immersion for a while. Then I eventually went back to the full RTH up to around 1500 hanzi, just to fill in some blank spots I had. Then I went back to learning hanzi in vocabulary/sentences, since it's easier for me to do that again.

You might eventually add on some other study activities, as desired or needed for your goals. \n\nFor example, you might eventually read a pronunciation guide for a language and add audiobook listening or learning podcasts (Like Coffee Break French, LanguageTransfer, dialogues with audio from books, etc). You might add shows and looking up words that way too, etc. You might eventually go back to a grammar guide and read more into things confusing you later on. You might eventually do a Language Exchange with people to practice writing/speaking, if those are goals of yours later. Whatever your goals are, or become later, you'll probably experiment with other study tools and methods and find ones that help you work on goals that this study method you plan to try might be lacking in.\n\nAs for your plan - I've done pretty much the same thing with French, it worked fine. I enjoyed it, it felt like puzzle solving and each time I improved felt so cool! It only taught me to read though. I had to find other learning materials to pick up better pronunciation and listening skills, and had to practice speaking/writing to actually develop an active vocabulary. I mainly only wanted to read in french though, so it worked.\n\nI read through a grammar guide (a short free website) just to get familiar with the structure roughly. I looked up \"most common word\" lists, and would read through them or glance at them every week or so. I don't like flashcards, so that's how I picked up a few hundred common words (and became 'roughly' familiar with maybe 1000). And I read - first wikipedia and news, looking up words I felt I needed in order to follow the main idea. (You could look up every unknown word, or just key words you feel are important - I did it both ways, both were helpful). Over time I could understand more. I eventually tried to read educational articles, and history books, and graded readers. Eventually, novels. It took about 1 year for me to get to where I could read and pick up the main idea in texts and use a dictionary to look up key words for clarification or details. And then once I hit around year 2 I could understand the main idea pretty easily, and details depending on how familiar I was with the genre/subject, and could usually forgo using a dictionary to lookup words and guess key words based on context. So I rarely use a dictionary now unless I want to precisely know a detail (I think probably a more diligent person would keep looking up keywords, but I can just read at a level I'm comfortable at so I don't really bother looking things up unless I have to). \n\nAlso: I changed my google to french early on, its still in french 3 years on, and I'm sure that helped. Just because websites regularly show up in french first, definitions show up in french, wikipedia shows up in french, so I got forced to read daily at least a little - and now that I don't actively seek out french novels regularly, its a way for me to still see french often (since I'm reading definitions in french/answers in french all the time). I also used to try to lookup things specifically by asking them in french, which gave me more practice. \n\nI thought studying this way was good for me, because I hate flashcards lol. I have since used a modified version of doing this along with Other study activities to study chinese - and I do use flashcards once in a while now, because while I hate them, I can cram 1000 words in a few weeks, then reinforce and learn them properly by running into them as I read. So it speeds up the process for me (since the cards are kind of like 'looking up words' before I read, instead of during so I don't have to pause when reading as much). For french it wasn't as necessary, since there were lots of cognates and words with grammar endings helping me recognize them a little bit/remember them easier. I think I would've improved faster in french with flashcards, but I was happy at the pace I went. Likewise, I'd improve just fine in chinese without flashcards (I'm not using them right now) it just might have been slower. Especially at the beginning stage, just cramming a lot of common hanzi and common words gave me a foundation which helped speed things up. \n\nWhere this method lacked for me: I had 0 pronunciation skills. I took a beginner french class, just so I could hear the proper way to speak. (Alternatively, there's lots of free ways to get examples of pronunciation). The teacher also was helpful in that she taught how to conjugate for basic past, present, and future tense - so I could apply common words I knew and express myself in a basic way about most things pretty quickly. Not perfectly, but it helped. When studying on my own, I now prioritize learning those real basic ways to say things, so that once I learn common words I can start practicing writing/speaking and move words into my active vocabulary (usually by chatting with language partners). Writing/speaking I could not develop by just reading and looking up words. Also listening - around year 2 I could read at a level I was happy with in french, but still couldn't listen to basic conversations. I ended up finding language learning podcasts so I could get used to hearing french and learn the pronunciations of words I'd picked up reading. My listening skills are still attrocious. If I tried to improve now - I'd probably incorporate more audio books (or audio as I read) to try and close this gap. I'd also use the \"comprehensible input french\" channels on youtube to try and fix this. With chinese, I did not make the same choices - so I made sure to use different study methods to work on listening, writing, and speaking earlier than with french.\n\nIn summary: reading and looking words up works, its not the fastest thing ever but it works fine especially if you enjoy doing it enough to keep doing it. It starts sort of hard, then gets easier - since at first things are barely comprehensible. Yes, reading a grammar guide and learning common words before diving in (or during the beginning) helps shorten how long before reading feels more manageable. Reading while looking words up will develop reading skill. For listening, writing, speaking, if those are goals you will eventually need to incorporate study methods to help improve these goals.  \n\nIf I knew what language you were learning, I could recommend some resources. I've used a few free online grammar guides as resources (mainly chinese and french, but I've seen sites for other languages). There's also a few common word lists floating around that I've found really helpful. In particular two: one 750 word list, and one 300 word list \"to say anything.\" I've used the 300 word list in any language I've needed to speak in since I found it, because it really does cover \"what words do I need to express myself basically and Quickly.\" Then just looking up common word lists in general can be helpful, if you plan to read then a lot of these lists are based on reading materials.", "created_utc": "1606854658.0", "edited": "1606854904.0", "id": "geand0w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k4qj85", "parent_id": "t3_k4qj85", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for the message!

This is just kind of my experience with it:\n\n1. If you can find More comprehensible input material, it will be easier to pick things up from it. So if you understand 70% it will probably be easier for you to learn from then stuff only 40% comprehensible - even though material doesn't feel Easy to study from until its 95-98% comprehensible. So if learning material that is made tailored to be comprehensible to you is boring to you, you can definitely go find materials that are harder but more enjoyable/interesting. Just be aware that there's still levels of \"how hard is this\" so you can still try to find things somewhat easier than other things. And if you pick harder things, even if they're less comprehensible, you will be able to pick some things up. So if it interests you, go for it.\n\n2. When I started, I just did 10-20 minute bursts of watching shows. Then eventually, 10-20 minute bursts of reading. (You could do more, I just couldn't tolerate more it drained me). It was very hard at first, and I was confused a lot at first. Over time, it got easier for me to recognize the gist of the main idea. And then the full main idea clearly, then eventually pick up details too. Simply consuming more content helped make that easier. Engaging with stuff I liked also motivated me to study more - I realized the more words I knew, the easier shows got, and reading got. I quickly went through learning 2000 words, and reading became bearable and more comprehensible. Shows became actually enjoyable and I can always catch the main gist now - and if I work with one show for a while, then eventually the main ideas fully and many of the details. Now immersing in content I like mostly drives what words I look up, since I read novels a lot. \n\n3. I didn't take notes because I'm lazy. At first I would watch, and try to only look up key words that seemed really important if I wanted to figure out the main gist of what was going on. At first that meant a lot of pausing and looking up in a phone dictionary app. I tried to limit myself to only every few minutes. As I learned more/watched more, I moved to only looking words up every several minutes or so - and also got used to watching longer segments. I do try to pay attention so I can catch as much as I can, but I also find the more you do it the less 'draining' it feels to catch what's going on. I was a lot like you describe, after I did this for a few months - I could catch the rough topic or gist but struggled to figure out details. After a few more months, it got easier. I also notice its easier in genres I'm used to, and harder with new shows (probably again, because comprehensibility must be higher in familiar genres since I know more of the words). With reading, I do a variety. Sometimes I do intensive reading where I look up most unknown words, sometimes I do extensive reading and look up no unknown words and see how much I can follow, and sometimes I look up just key words that seem very important because they keep showing up. All activities seem to help in varied ways. Sometimes I also rewatch/relisten/reread things I've gone through before, and I do think that helps me comprehend more the subsequent times around. Since I already know the gist by then, I can usually catch more details. But I get bored re-doing things, so I don't do that much.\n\n4.   I think to a degree \"vaguely aware of the main gist\" and \"understanding the main idea\" and \"understanding the main idea and many details\" are various stages. How comprehensible something is determines where you start out with a material. And over time, you'll get better at comprehending as you practice with a material more. I also find myself going through this cycle all the time when reading. I'll read one novel and go from confused! To just barely finally following the plot! To it being quite clear and catching most things! Then I switch to a new author, and even though the words aren't particularly harder, I'm suddenly back to being barely able to follow a plot. Reading more... solves the problem. I think its just sort of when you hit a 'blank' spot in your learning, it feels much less comprehensible again, until you fill in that knowledge gap. At least this is how it feels to me.\n\n5. Feel free to bounce between different levels of comprehensible material. 95-98% comprehensible material is great for extensive reading, because you can read easily and pick up new words without much effort. Stuff a bit less comprehensible, is usually a challenge but manageable and can help boost your base level of what's comprehensible to you as you develop the skills to understand it better (learn words from it, get better at following that type of material etc). Stuff that's much harder is definitely a ride, but it can help show you how much you have learned and things you might want to start noticing. I read my goal-novel author about once a month. When I started, it was brutal, could not even do a paragraph. Then a few months later, I found I could read pieces of the novel passages and follow the gist. Later, I could actually pick up some main ideas. Now, I can actually pick up some details, and push through a chapter and grasp at least the main idea. Its nowhere where I want to be, but its very clear progress. And I feel that each time I challenge myself, I help myself develop some skills I'll eventually need to read those kinds of goal materials. Relatedly, I think graded readers are really helpful for when incomprehensible input feels too unbearable. If jumping right into under 95% comprehensible stuff feels too draining, doing some graded readers to push up how much you can comprehend (or doing podcasts for learners etc, shows that are easier), can help make the jump later into harder material feel less drastic.\n\n6. I sort of think that part of using 'incomprehensible material' is just getting used to how it feels to try and engage with it. Usually people feel able to tolerate 95-98% comprehensibility. So when anything is less, it might feel untolerable. But really, a lot of stuff 50-90% comprehensible might have some chunks that ARE comprehensible and you can learn from easily, and engaging with the less comprehensible stuff will help develop tolerance for ambiguity and the skills of picking out what you can manage to understand from less-than-ideally comprehensible things. For me, I felt the sooner I got used to using anything to engage with, the less limits I had. I found challenging things manageable instead of something I 'couldn't even engage with' and I found a lot of moderately comprehensible things I could learn from and enjoy. Plus the comprehension just goes up so... it feels great to see novels I couldn't follow even a little, start making more and more sense over time! The first language I made any progress with - French - I learned 500-1000 common words, took one beginner french class, then started reading. Whatever I could find. First wikipedia and graded readers because they were 'almost bearable' then news and informational books and eventually just whatever I wanted. I got used to the 'difficulty' early since I just dived in. And then it just got easier, because it was never as hard as it was when I'd first started trying. It worked, and after maybe a year of looking up key words when I didn't understand them, I got to a point where a lot of words I just could start picking up from context. Which was exciting. When I started Chinese, I tried to replicate that a bit - but went much easier on myself in some ways. French had been the first time I'd made progress beyond beginner knowledge at a language, and so at least for me, I felt just diving in and trying to DO what I wanted to do in a language, helps me learn to do it faster.", "created_utc": "1606784004.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ge7ktev", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k3tfdj", "parent_id": "t3_k3tfdj", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Does anyone know how to check if one's healthcare covers sterilization?

I also find just exposing myself daily to chinese (shows w/ chinese subs, chinese audio in the bg, or reading a book etc) help me see/hear new words I'm learning regularly enough I manage to learn and retain them a bit easier.", "created_utc": "1605810285.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcuqq4i", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jx3adt", "parent_id": "t3_jx3adt", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Mm when I start learning a language, I try to learn 1000-2000 words, and read through a grammar guide (just so I have an overview of what sentences are probably going to look like, I don't memorize), before I try to read much. So you may want to just keep learning vocab/grammar before you get too hard on yourself. Its totally normal to struggle a bit for a while. Even once I've done those things, its still a few months of reading before it stopped feeling draining and started getting more manageable feeling. You're studying french - back when I was studying french, I read through this grammar guide as a beginner: https://www.languageguide.org/french/grammar/ Although, there were more I looked into more in depth later on.\n\nAnd yes, exactly what you said! Its a trade-off. I just sort of go 'I think I understood the main gist' and move on, when I don't feel like double checking the sentence with a translator. Which does speed me up! But sometimes it means later I realize I misunderstood a main point, so then I have to go back and reread a bit or use the translator then on a few sentences or a paragraph for clarification. More often then you'd think though, guessing the main idea is 'good enough.' After all, when we started reading in our native languages, we probably all went through many 'difficult' novels where we didn't understand every sentence clearly, but also didn't bother looking things up. And we still got through the books okay. We still ultimately got better at reading.\n\nI do some listening practice. But the ways I do it are a bit weird tbh. 1. I have audio files that are sort of like 'anki sentence audio cards' but all in big 20 minute chunks. They say the english, then the chinese sentence, and are from a premade deck so they're simple words/sentences that gradually i+1 get more complicated. That's my 'easy background' language study to listen to. It helps me review listening to common words I probably read that day. I also do something called listening-reading method (but a lighter version then the original maker of the study method suggests). I can link what I do. But in gist: 1. read a translation in english. 2. Listen to the chinese audio, and read the chinese text (I can look up words if I want, but mainly I just listen without pause to match the sounds to visual words on a page). 3. Listen to the chinese audio, look at the english translation, and try to use it like a transcript to match the translation to any unknown words, focusing on comprehending as much of the audio I'm hearing as I can. Then optional: I'll read the chinese again, listening to the audio again, usually matching MUCH more sounds to words/phrases I've just picked up. \n\nI say \"gist\" because I usually only do some of these steps, and sometimes I do this instead: read in chinese and look up any unknown words, then reread without pausing while following along with the audio. Strangely enough, listening to chinese while using the english translation like a 'reference' to glance at when I don't know a word has actually helped the 'listening' part of the skill most - because I'm mostly just focusing on the chinese audio during that part. (If you do want more about listening-reading method, this is where I read about it: http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm, and this is a post I did on it - scroll to very bottom for a short summary: https://rigelmejo.tumblr.com/post/632975943205568512/listening-reading-experiment-resources )\n\nTo simplify though: I genuinely think if you do just ANY listening, it will help. Even background listening. Its helped a ton since I've just ADDED more listening. What might be most convenient for You, could be: read a chapter while looking up anything unknown you want, then reread while trying to follow along with a french audiobook. This is what I do most often when I don't want to spend much time doing it/want to focus mostly on reading. Alternately, just listening to audiobook in the background sometimes - since it will be good to hear the words you've looked up, they'll review in your mind as you keep hearing them.", "created_utc": "1605741393.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcrsu6h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jw3keu", "parent_id": "t1_gcr3d9z", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for sharing your experiences! This is really helpful to read, I think you're doing an amazing job!\n\nI think its exactly how you said - if doing 3 helps you, and you enjoy it, then you can keep doing it. But also like you said, efficiency wise, it seems to be slowing down your reading speed. I'm not sure if skipping those sentences would speed you up much though - because the lower comprehension overall of the story, would mean less sentences falling under 2 later on. Whereas the more you understand early, potentially the more context you'll have to not be confused as much by similar sentences later. That said... it is more effort to do 3, so if you feel like skipping it, I don't think it would hurt your studies either.\n\nMy approach, if it helps. I've been reading for maybe 5 months though so its a bit different then it was when I started. 1. I have sentences I understand, or mostly do and I can guess the unknown word/grammar from context. 2. I have a mostly comprehensible sentence, and just have to look up a few parts to comprehend it (click a popup-definition in my Reader for the word). 3. I have a sentence where I know all words, or have looked up unknown words, and am still not sure I understood it correctly - in this case, I put the sentence or paragraph (if it has related context) into a translator like DeepL and just double check I understood it correctly. Usually I notice I misunderstood 2 hanzi as separate words when it was really 1 new word my dictionary didn't have, or notice a collection of words were actually a phrase with a not-literal meaning so I didn't realize it. Sometimes its a grammar thing. This usually only takes me a minute or less, because I understand more generally now. 4. I rarely get these anymore - sentences where I've looked things up, still don't even have a guess of what it means. This usually only happens when I'm being lazy and have decided to skip 3 sentences - so 3 sentences automatically become these if my guess of their general meaning happened to be wrong. I just try my best to guess what they might mean, and move on. So a similar process to yours - my type 3 sentences just don't take me as long to figure out, since I usually still comprehend their gist already I'm just checking a detail or two in them to be certain. \n\nWhen I started, a lot more of the sentences were ALL type 3 and 4. What I did was - I looked up some type 3 the way you did. But to speed up time, whenever I had a good guess about what a type 3 sentence's main idea was, then I just kept reading. I only looked up type 3 sentences when I couldn't even Guess at what they might mean generally. And I only looked up type 4 sentences when they seemed like very plot-relevant, and like I needed to figure them out to follow the main idea of the plot. When I started though, I did a lot of \"pick up print book, try to read\" and only looked up 1-2 words a page, just doing my best to guess the main ideas even when most sentences were 3 or 4s. Whether I looked up any words in a dictionary, or actually translated a full sentence to compare, really depended on if I felt up to the effort of looking things up. Eventually that became 'extensive' reading with the easier materials. I do think the intensive reading though - where I look up most unknown words - speeds up how many new words I pick up though. So I think, whether you do 3 or skip type 3 sentences and just do the other simpler word lookups, either way your comprehension will keep improving as you read more.", "created_utc": "1605712140.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcq2wyp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jw3keu", "parent_id": "t3_jw3keu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I second all this advice!

When I would say I started understanding the gist of the 'main ideas' in the plot of a show, was 8 months in. When I started understanding the main ideas pretty decently, and catching some specific details, was around 10-12 months in. And it greatly depends on the genre - shows in genres I've watched more I know more words in, so they're easier, versus the genres I hardly watch where I comprehend only the main overall gist. I only can follow most everything except a few details if: its a show I've seen before, or in a very specific genre I know a lot of words for (modern detective shows, romance shows). If you're asking how long it took to understand enough I felt I could relax when watching shows and not focus so hard to catch the main ideas, probably months 10-12. This is all assuming with chinese subtitles on. With no subtitles, my understanding lags a bit. So without chinese subs I can watch for main gist right now, but don't catch as many words (my listening comprehension is just lagging in general).\n\nI think the only reason this timeline was as fast as it was, is because I was trying to watch chinese shows in months 3-8. Absolutely struggling, confused, trying so hard to try and follow the plots. Usually of shows with no english subs, because I just wanted to watch them so bad. I would watch 12 minutes then give up cause it would be too hard, pause scenes to read subtitles and look up words, rewatch some scenes a couple times. That motivated me to grind through learning 2000 words pretty fast with flashcards just to make watching easier. I didn't really make any progress 'understanding' until month 8, having practiced trying to 'understand' for months and having more vocabulary by then. \n\nI think part of the challenge is vocab/grammar knowledge - which you can improve by studying, to make comprehension easier. But another part is simply practice. It takes practice to listen to chinese in real time, glance through subtitles in real time, to recognize words you've studied in context, to become comfortable with the ambiguity of not understanding everything. Watching shows is you practicing reading/listening skills while under time limits, learning to put together everything you know to comprehend what you can, and learning how to do all that quickly enough to start picking up new words from context too. It takes practice. No matter how little or much you know, it probably takes practice to get used to doing it. I only tried to watch/read chinese so early on, because I studied japanese once a long while back and it took me 2.5 years to read even the simplest mangas and only comprehend the main idea. I think a lot of the reason it took so long, was because I didn't even Try to read or watch japanese until year 2. So when I started chinese I just threw myself into trying earlier on, so I could start developing those skills earlier. \n\nChallenge yourself by trying to watch what you want to watch now. And learn more common vocabulary words during your studies and/or lookup words as you watch, if you're struggling to follow the plot. (Tools like Viki's dual subs, Language Learning with Netflix, hard chinese subs with soft eng subs on youtube help make word lookup more convenient, etc).", "created_utc": "1605706815.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gcptmnc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jwdn26", "parent_id": "t3_jwdn26", "score": "9", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I am very much a show watcher/reader, so I'm not sure how much will apply.

I was studying French a few years ago - which is where I figured out on my own that learning common words, reading a grammar guide, and then immersing asap to challenge myself seem to get me to make progress. I had 1 beginner class to kickstart it which did help for me because my teacher taught pronunciation good, and taught us simple past/present/future for a majority of verbs so we could express any basic thoughts, and it definitely made immersion easier in combo with the stuff I was doing myself.\n\nI studied japanese for a while where I had both good classes which I think helped with pronunciation and making grammar a breeze to understand, I used nukemarine's decks (which seem similar to MIA RTK and Tango N5 and Tae Kim's just all put together for ease of study), and immersed.\n\nI started Chinese a year ago, got farther than japanese because I have a better study plan. And for Chinese I learned my lesson from French and MIA - I immersed earlier on and often. In chinese now my speaking/writing is near my French level, reading is a bit below my French level, and pronunciation is far better than my French. With japanese I was afraid to immerse often for 2 years, and that held me back a ton. So with chinese I dived in immediately. Also MIA's advice of \"immerse in what you passionately are interested in\" I think is solid. With chinese, I had goal novels I wanted to understand from day 1, some cdramas I literally had no subs for and would eventually need to learn chinese if I wanted to watch. So the motivation to learn so I could comprehend was strong.\n\nFor Chinese I've also just been doing the things that work for me personally - reading constantly, immersing, audio a lot (MIA is to thank for this), srs flashcards (when I can stand to), grammar guides, pronunciation guides, and for me talking/writing with people every so often so if I've started a bad habit someone can call me out. MIA recommends against early output. I agree people are going to make less mistakes if they wait longer to output, and will have to do less 'correcting mistakes' work if they wait until they comprehend a large amount before outputting. I'm just impatient and like chatting with people. For me, outputting really motivated me to Ramp Up my active vocabulary, improves my vocabulary because people give me comprehensible input back, and really helped me fix my tones/notice the sounds much better - since I need to be able to 'hear' the difference between me and a correction, and I have to listen to language partners without subtitles or sometimes even a common english understanding to fall back on. (However I really do think MIA's advice is more efficient long term, and probably leads to less mistakes/bad habits production wise overall). Basically - it took a lot of trial and error to find out what worked for me versus what failed. MIA overall is great, because it has a solid study plan to follow, and seems to have a lot of what I already discovered was working for me. Some people are always going to need to take some of the good and leave the rest - before MIA there was ajatt, and people managed to learn japanese with that method. MIA was a more 'figured out what worked' in ajatt and add more things that work, as far as I understand at least at first.

That said, I think to be honest, any method you can make some progress with is fine - as long as you can stick with it and keep challenging yourself. Even people who use textbooks, if they keep pushing themselves into more difficult textbooks with more words/more sentence patterns, more real reading examples, and eventually push themselves into native content and immerse more and more - they\u2019ll eventually learn what they want to learn. Learners who take other approaches to eventually cover all that material will too. The most important thing is that you can pick study methods that help you progress, then keep doing them and keep challenging yourself. Some might be more or less efficient, but I struggled the most when I just got stuck relearning the same basic material by switching study plans over and over.\n\nI eventually realized for myself: reading a grammar guide summary, learning common words ASAP, and immersing helped me make progress. I learned challenging myself with target language books and audio-only material made me progress. I realized srs flashcards when I used them, helped me boost what I comprehended. That talking to native speakers helped me expand my active vocabulary etc. That for me, a language partner or tutor giving me corrections on pronunciation before I formed long term bad habits helps. That listening a ton passively helps me. I figured out a lot through trial and error and what works for one person might not work for another. Giving up or not consistently deciding to increase difficulty of study material is what screwed me. \n\nThe ideas in MIA that have helped me a lot are immersing often, and using srs flashcards to improve efficiency. Which I sort of learned to do myself through trial and error and noticing it helped speed my progress - then I found MIA and was happy to see more tips for language learning I could apply. I love a lot of MIA because much of it i can easily adapt as things I already knew were working for me, and now I can see a structured plan to sort of use MIA for a guide to fill in any areas I wasn\u2019t improving or studying well with before. MIA has worked great for me since so much matches up with things I\u2019ve had success with in the past, but there\u2019s also areas where I have to figure out what I\u2019ll do to improve in x area more on my own. \n\nSummary: immersion and MIA are great if they work for you. For myself, I\u2019d add immersion on top of any other study plan I did anyway, since I think it speeds up progress and every learner will eventually have to immerse. Either as a beginner, or later when textbooks/classes/their method run out of material that  them progress or they run into a situation they have to learn to use the language for on their own. So MIA/immersion along with any study plan is probably going to help. As for if someone does only Mia/only immersion/or other things too? That really depends on their own progress and needs and figuring out what works for them. If they do Mia for 6 months and see no progress, maybe they need to look into supplemental Mia materials more or into pushing up difficulty, or they just will study better with other methods to support immersion etc. Only the learner is going to know what they\u2019ll need.", "created_utc": "1605034352.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gbuse7g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jr7hac", "parent_id": "t3_jr7hac", "score": "5", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you so much for linking this!", "created_utc": "1604970869.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gbs5gd6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jr5mfn", "parent_id": "t3_jr5mfn", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "If you L2 (English) skill is decently high, you will probably be fine doing what you've been doing. 1 hour sounds like enough.

And at the beginning stages I kept going back to anki or memrise every couple months, to cram 500-1000 words at a time, because I needed an efficient comprehension boost to make reading easier otherwise I was going to burn out from how hard the reading material was. Also, in the beginning stages graded readers help - because they have less unknown words, so you can practice extensive reading a bit quicker for a while. I used a mix of graded readers and real-easy webnovels, in between brute forcing harder ones - just to give myself a mental break. Basically, I used anki to learn a lot of common words in bulk, and I used graded readers to also reinforce a lot of common words and grammar patterns so later when I ran into simple stuff in reading novels, I already had some comprehension to rely on.\n\nIt was only once I'd read through a grammar guide for the gist, studied 2000 common words, a few hundred sentences, and 1500ish hanzi, that I started brute forcing novels more regularly and doing anki less. I just don't like flashcard systems - although if I kept using anki, I would be learning new words much more efficiently. \n\nI don't use anki right now, which makes me happy. I've just been reading a few different webnovels I like - and looking up words to learn them. I don't know how the process will be if you're learning japanese etc. For me, studying chinese, if a word I lookup is spelled with hanzi I already know then I learn the word within a few times of looking it up. If the hanzi that make up a word are totally new, then it takes me more like 15-20 times of seeing it over and over to learn it. This actually isn't too big of a deal, because often these words if they're important or an author's regularly used words, DO keep popping up 20+ times so I do eventually learn them. But this is definitely where just grinding hanzi anki or vocab anki cards would speed me up. But I'm ok doing it at this slower pace. I also find listening to audio of new words helps new words stick in my mind faster. The popup dictionary I use can play audio (Pleco Reader), so I usually play word-audio the first time or two I look up a word - until I can remember its pronunciation. \n\nSo yeah basically, I do what you guessed. I don't use anki at all right now. I learn new vocabulary by looking them up as I read, and listening to their pronunciation the first couple times I see them. I am studying chinese though, so for a decent portion of new words if I know the hanzi its sort of like seeing 2+ syllables I can pronounce and know what they mean, and just learning what the new combination means. Which I think helps make a lot of words very quick to pick up. \n\nI don't plan to go back to using anki unless: I hit another difficulty curve where I am genuinely looking up so many new words per paragraph that just bulk-learning 1000 words in a couple weeks with anki will make my life easier, or 1000 hanzi, etc. I do love the sentence cards in anki and think they're very good tools for learning grammar/examples of how to produce the language. I think a quick way to pick those rules up are definitely anki. I just hate flashcards though... so I have audio files of the Spoonfed Chinese anki deck, and just listen to them in the background as my 'comprehensible sentence' listening study, and then use sentences I read for the 'comprehensible sentences' reading exposure.  For me its just easier to quickly read a grammar book, then just see real sentences for exposure to how the grammar actually works, instead of doing flashcards.

If you do want to learn a language. Either way, eventually both will take motivation to keep studying.\n\nI tried learning French on a whim because I sucked at language learning, and wanted to prove I could. My reasons were mainly - it could help with a career one day. I got into some old historical french books and wanting to read is basically what pushed me. I finally found good language learning advice, made progress. I liked that studying french taught me what worked/didn't work for me, how to self motivate, and showed me how milestones progressed for me - when I could accomplish a task by studying X thing, then improve by doing Y thing to reach another goal, etc. I think that helped a lot since Japanese takes more study hours to reach those milestones, so me knowing what I did to study would eventually be effective even if it took longer kept me motivated while studying japanese later. For reference what milestones took me 6 months in french would take me 2 years in japanese :/ If I had not had success with French first to show me what gave me milestones and which milestones came first, then I would've given up on japanese probably because progress was happening so slow it was hard for me to notice. \n\nI studied french for a while then once I could read the books I wanted, jumped to Japanese to actually study something I wanted to use more in daily life. I think if you're good at self-motivating and keeping yourself studying progressively new material, you can just jump right into what you really want to study more. Just like be aware all languages take time and effort for a while, and the often given advice that some languages just 'take longer' to reach milestones does seem to be sometimes true.\n\nI would say just study what you enjoy and care about. If you like japanese content more, learn how to understand that so you can enjoy things raw like you want to. If later you want to learn French for career, you'll have the skills and study plan already figured out, so you can just apply that to french really effectively.\n\nI went into Chinese just because i wanted to read novels raw, and wanting to talk to people came as a motivator for me later on. I made progress in chinese way faster than japanese, just because 1. I have an even better idea of good study plans for myself now and 2. i am really motivated to read the novels I want to read/hurry up and understand raws. Whereas with japanese, I was okay even if it took me 10 years, low motivation to study frequently or challenge myself. With Chinese, from like month 3 i was trying to slog through novels because I had no translations and just Wanted To Read them asap.

I think a LOT of the mass immersion approach assumes you are studying with a lot of i+1 comprehensible input (All or a Majority of your active study materials - the flashcards you make and study). \n\nMIA also includes some exposure to stuff harder than i+1. I think its okay because it broadens your useful material from \"just made for learners\" to \"anything in the language you're interested in.\" You'll still be learning a lot from the comprehensible input portion the most (the i+1 portions of the language material you immerse with). I do think though that with languages where the difficulty curve between made-for-learner material to native content is so steep, immersing in native content often builds up your tolerance for ambiguity. And that helps motivate you to not give up when 1. you jump from study material to difficult native material, 2. to keep working at looking up words and studying to build up what IS comprehensible to you (studying flashcards, looking up words in immersion, just engaging with and trying to comprehend what you can in immersion versus zoning out and deciding its 'too hard'). \n\nI have seen in a lot of japanese and chinese learner forms, people really struggling to adjust from learner-made material that is specifically designed to be very easy to understand, to native material that will generally have a LOT of unknowns for a learner for years until they finally work up to that level of understanding. And to work up to that level? Learners will eventually have to study From native material - and whether its immediately, or after 1-3 years studying with only learner-friendly i+1 material, they will eventually still hit that steep difficulty curve of going into native material with i+1 portions and much more difficult hard-to-comprehend portions. So the sooner a learner adjusts to being comfortable with that ambiguity, and the journey of improving it over time and effort, the more willingly they'll be able to keep engaging with native material and push up their level of what is comprehensible. \n\nI personally see very little contradiction between krashen's ideas and how MIA works. MIA just recongizes the reality that its hard to find 100% i+1 material, so if some is a bit over i+1 then that happens sometimes and we can get used to the ambiguity and slowly work up to understanding those parts. Which I think in practice, anyone doing krashen's way would do exactly the same - unless a wonderful learner material already existed for that language that provided i+1 catered materials all the way up into the difficulty of native content - which some very good in person classes may do if taught from beginner to intermediate/advanced and focusing on i+1 frequent input in increasing difficulty, which some books emulate to a degree (like Francais Par Le Method Nature, Lingva Latina). But like, anyone trying to do comphrehensible input on their own is going to end up doing something similar to MIA where sometimes the stuff in their immersion is less comprehensible than i+1 sometimes, in the hopes they get enough i+1 throughout the course of study to start comprehending more over time. Which usually happens fine.\n\nBefore I ever found MIA, I was following krashen's ideas and still ended up doing a very MIA like study plan. I was studying french. I learned some 500 common words - to make more input comprehensible to me. I read a grammar guide - to make more input more comprehensible to me. I read some graded readers, some textbook dialogues (Teach Yourself books I like best lol, and French for Reading) where my comprehension was at 80-99%. And mostly? I just went online and brute force tried to read french with google translate open to lookup unknown words that seemed important (so matt's advice of looking up only every so many minutes, reading based on interest, and getting used to tolerating ambiguity - even tho I didn't know of MIA yet). At first I understood like 50% of things I read. Then over time, like 60-70% so I could grasp the main ideas of articles, just not details in sentences. In news, wikipedia, and informational books on sociology/linguistics/history in french, it quickly got closer to 80-90% comprehension. After about a year I stopped looking up words in the dictionary except once every couple weeks, because I could comprehend 80%+ of most anything, and could now start learning many new words from context mostly. And my exposure to less-comprehensible stuff at the beginning? Made me extremely tolerant of ambiguity so it did not discourage or demotivate me. (Compared to the 95-100% comprehension that is generally necessary to feel fully comfortable reading without a dictionary, for picking up words without a dictionary). About a year after that, french got even easier, it felt usually 90-100% comprehensible. Now I can just read french pretty comfortably, my default dictionary and wikipedia and half my sites are in french and i don't even notice anymore which one i've gotten into lol. Now keep in mind - back then i didn't know about MIA or srs flashcards. So if I'd used srs flashcards, I could've gotten WAY more i+1 comprehensible input in a focused way, and probably been much more efficient in my study and progress. But even with just some random books/guides/word lists, some learner graded-comprehensible input and native input, I managed to get better over time. So I do think whether input is 90% comprehensible, or much less, it will help you make progress.\n\nI think if nothing else, those things you only 10% comprehend do some things. They WILL likely have some pieces inside them that are i+1 comprehensible input. They will help you build tolerance to ambiguity, which will keep you motivated to not give up your language learning - since ambiguity will still remain for a while. They will help make some things More comprehensible over time - listening to the language WILL help the sounds themselves become clearer to you, long term making input a bit more comprehensible. Reading the language Will help the writing system and grammar become more comprehensible to you over time - you will get more familiar with the patterns, the spelling, the symbols, and then in the future as you LEARN new words and grammar structures they will be Much easier for you to immediately notice and comprehend easier. So even low-comprehensible material will have some benefits long term. Particularly, in my opinion, on keeping you motivated and unlikely to give up when things are difficulty, and helping you get more used to the language's sounds/writing so that you pick it up easier once it Becomes More Comprehensible later (versus being so unfamiliar that even when you learn those words, they stump you when listening or reading and Frustrate you into feeling like giving up).\n\nAlthough, its really the pieces of comprehensible input that are overall over time pushing your level of comprehension upwards. You can use learner-made materials (like graded readers, learner podcasts) to push up this comprehension in the beginning and/or dive straight into native material (which will always have at least SOME comprehensible input). Eventually, somewhere in intermediate, you have to move into native content to start running into more comprehensible i+1 input instead of just stuff at your level. At that point, in native content you'll always be bound to run into some comprehensible input and some incomprehensible since it's not made tailored to any learner's specific comprehension level. At this point you either learn to tolerate that ambiguity, look up a LOT of stuff to try and push up what's comprehensible asap, a mix, or you already have been immersing from earlier on and find the ambiguity bearable. \n\nIf following MIA, then regardless of the material you immerse with whether its learner-made or native content, you'll be studying with flashcards and/or sentences that ARE i+1 comprehensible input and its been steadily pushing up your comprehension level and will continue to do so. Immersion will also be pushing up your comprehension level. Your sentence flashcards will just be doing it in a more consistent \"nearly always i+1 study material\" way, compared to native material that will be a mixture of some things easy for you, some nice i+1 material, and some stuff too hard to comprehend much of until you improve a bit more.

They weren't perfect flashcards - later I realized premade sentence decks existed which I think would've been better - but they sufficed. Then I went back to watching and reading eventually, and those words I 'vaguely' studied as I crammed flashcards all got learned pretty easily, and I was able to stop the flashcards. Once I had done maybe 2000 words, 2000 hanzi cards (I found a hanzi deck too), I just stopped because I was at a point where looking up words while reading was working for me again. And I go back to flashcard sets every so often when I need more of a 'basis' to rely on to help me out as I pick up new words in context later in reading/listening etc. (I personally don't like studying with flashcards, I can't sustain focus with them, so I try to do them in bursts then study without them - and I know its overall less efficient, but when I can't focus on flashcards studying 10 takes me an hour which is also just.. not efficient, flashcards just aren't really sustainably compatible for me personally). \n\nI don't think my method was 'perfect' but it works for me and that's all I needed. Sometimes people do suggest making your own flashcard decks for good reason - personal connection so you remember better, have what you need in them, may be more efficient for what you need to learn. But if making flashcards takes you ages, or you don't need that 'level' of efficiency, it still works to use some premade decks and just get going toward where you're heading goals wise. It still might be more efficient than a learner who doesn't think about vocab or frequency at all, and gets a introductory textbook with 200 words total (I did that with chinese once lol), at least 2000 relatively common words will push me toward my goals a bit better, even if those weren't perfectly chosen words. And now I am at a point where when i look new words up, I know at least 1 hanzi in the new words or I recognize some similarity in the new word to words I know, so they're much easier to learn and remember since I have some kind of 'thing' to attach them to in my mind.

I find it somewhat difficult - even though it may not be, it may just be an 'adjustment curve' of getting used to reading it. Since I do try to pick a graded reader at a level I should be able to read and just pick up some new words from, and reinforce grammar patterns with. I start reading that graded reader.\n\nAs soon as I get bored, I switch to a novel in the target language written for native speaker audiences. It will either be a complete slog (I can understand only like 50-70%), or just mildly difficult (a lot more word lookups than the graded reader). Also how hard this is depends on if I choose to just extensively read (not look words up, or look up words rarely) or if I've chosen to intensively read (look up every unknown word). I will usually do a mix of both, for both the graded reader and native level text.\n\nI go through the native level text until I feel tired of it, then switch back to the graded reader. This time - the graded reader feels quite easy, I can zoom through it. And I can usually handle the graded reader by primarily extensively reading (I can now more easily look up words rarely or not at all while reading it). At this point, I'll now pick a level harder graded reader, and do the process all over again. \n\nSince my goal is to read native level texts, then doing this allows me to do a few things. 1. Actively practice my end goal every so often. 2. See where I'm making progress in reading my end-goal material and what areas I'm still struggling to comprehend (certain vocabulary limitations, certain grammar patterns, certain novel genres just have more unknown words for me, some novel writing styles are easier or harder, etc). 3. I get to do something really challenging, so when I go back to ANY easier material it feels easier and motivates me to chug through it. And once I've chugged through the easier material, that helps push up my base comprehension level. So I can keep bringing up the bottom of my skill level, and gradually pushing it closer to where I'd like my comprehension level to eventually be.\n\nI usually pick 3 novel types: 1 graded reader at or one step above my comfortable reading level (because once I go back to it after a harder novel it Will be roughly at my comfort level), 1 native text novel that is one of the end-goal novels I want to be able to read (will likely be the hardest reading material), and 1 native text novel I find that is on the easier end of native text material (usually written for teens or young adults, webnovels with less dense descriptions, novels in genres I know more words for, novels I've read before in english, etc - basically I experiment and know these when I find them because they're a bit 'easier' for me to read then my end-goal novels). \n\nI will then start with the graded reader that feels a bit challenging to me and probably extensively read it - and intensively read if it has a lot of unknown vocab. When I get bored I will switch to my end-goal novel (since it interests me) and likely do a mix of intensive reading to pick up vocabulary and extensive reading to just see how much I can even comprehend. As soon as I get tired or bored or frustrated (so probably a couple pages or chapters in depending on my comprehension level), I will switch back to the graded reader. If the graded reader is now easier for me to get through then I will finish it up. If its too easy, I will switch to the easier-native-text novel and read that for a while. Usually by this point, the easier-native-text novel is a sweet spot that interests me but also is not so difficult it makes me tired. Eventually if my graded readers are boring me and don't feel very challenging, I end up just switching from the easier-text novel to the end-goal novel, back and forth. And then eventually, the bottom level of what I can comprehend keeps going up gradually. So I may pick a slightly more challenging book as my 'easier-text novel' etc.\n\nThis process has worked really well for me, at keeping me motivated, interested, challenged at a level I can handle, and its really rewarding to me to get to go back to the 'easier' things and actually see them GET easier for me, while also switching to my end-goal novels and seeing where I'm making improvements. It also helps me goal set - if I am lacking in some areas in my end-goal novel comprehension, it can help me pick the easier-reading material that will build a specific skill I want to work on. (I did this for getting more vocabulary for certain genres with easier books, for reading graded readers and just focusing on noticing how to distinguish proper nouns from other nouns, etc).\n\nFor listening, I've been attempting something similar. I have audio for sentence flashcards made for the language I'm studying - Chinese. I have audio files of an english sentence then the chinese one, made for learners. I listen to that on a regular basis - as listening material its very comprehensible to me since its learning material. Over time the material increases gradually by adding new words and grammar patterns. For you, I would suggest any youtube channel with lessons, LanguageTransfer maybe, any TeachYourself Book audios, any dialogues in textbooks, etc. There's lots of ways to find similar audio made for learners. Use this material as your easy \"Comprehensible input\" you use to improve the foundation of your listening skills. It will build a solid foundation as you practice with it, and as it gradually adds more vocabulary/grammar/phrases you can reliably recognize in learning audio material. I listen to this learner's audio material once a day or once every few days, gradually increasing the difficulty and reviewing older audios when I need review. I listen to them actively, or when walking/cleaning/working etc. These are just to build my foundation of listening skills.\n\nThen pick your goal listening material. Is there a movie or show or podcast or audio drama or youtuber you want to be able to listen to and comprehend? Use this as your other listening material. Try to listen to it every so often when you get bored of the learner material - and see where you are improving your ability to comprehend, and where you are lacking. Ideally, try to listen once without any transcript or subtitles. Then if you want to afterwards, use a transcript/subtitles and see which parts you understood through listening and which you didn't. Then in a while, try to listen again. \n\nAnd when it feels too hard, go back to that learner audio material, which is probably getting steadily more difficult. Continue switching between them as desired. You should notice yourself getting used to hearing faster words, slurred words, and slurred phrases in your goal material - and being able to recognize at least words you feel comfortable recognizing in the learning material. That's what happened with me. Again, consult a transcript/subtitles after a listen to the goal-material to see where you misheard things/didn't comprehend things. \n\nAnd, like with reading, I'll have intermediate options. There will usually be native audio material on topics I am familiar with, or spoken relatively clearly. Usually for me, these are audio books. Since I read a lot, there are a lot of audio books I will be familiar with the plot of. And if I struggle to comprehend what I hear, then afterwards I can listen a second time while looking at the novel text to see a transcript of what I should be hearing. (Or alternatively I can listen while reading the text the first time, then just listen the second time and see what I can comprehend with the context I got from reading along the first time). I actually find this intermediate step Really Helped me get comfortable with the speed/natural slurring of words in sentences. Because you practice following the text along with the audio. And once you've read a text before, you tend to scan it pretty fast. Eventually, you'll find you have to slow your own reading down to be slow enough to match the audio. And this ends up helping audio later feel less fast and more of a natural speed to you, when doing listening practice in general. \n\nSo, like with reading, I'll pick a learner-friendly material at my level, a end-goal listening material, and something intermediate.   And I go back and forth based on what's boring or challenging or tiring. I pretty consistently listen to the learner-audio since it slowly increases in difficulty.

Pimsleur etc get suggested often but upon looking into them they oversimply and barely cover the basics, let alone intensively. I've been debating if I can find a tutor or paid course at this point that would just focus intensively on tone pairs and tone sandhi changes in sentences, and where to look for those specializations. I need to really drill doing tone changes automatically when speaking sentences, and I feel awful subjecting language partners to my sentence-slow-downs as I think consciously of when to change, and then forget my train of thought and have to restart. I'd like to just really drill pronunciation for a while either on my own or with a paid/tutor course so I don't just muddle along with another learner and likely reinforce any bad habits since it's too much to expect someone to correct every single mistake I make unless they're a paid tutor who's consciously doing it or its myself doing it (and to even try to do it myself, I need a good guide/course/tool to use as reference).", "created_utc": "1604278926.0", "edited": "1604279601.0", "id": "gaunftn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jlw2qa", "parent_id": "t1_gari3im", "score": "1", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I largely agree with everything you've mentioned. And the book really is best used as an introductory/partial tool to help with remembering, while a student does actually need vocabulary words to learn the full/many meanings of characters and how they are used in the context of words and sentences. This book doesn't actually teach characters fully, does not teach words at all, and is at most a partial memory aid tool to help someone if this remembering-style suits their learning, to help them a bit as something to utilize as they actually study those other things. \n\nI do think books like this are useful in that, for me and I assume some others since mnemonics and these book types are popular, they give a piece of the character you can remember and start sticking more information to. For example, zi for child - sometimes it means child, sometimes it's part of noun words like table/chair/etc. For me, just seeing characters I recognize as 'table-child' helps me remember the word for table easier than if I just saw unknown-character-unknown-character. For some reason I attached the internal meaning of 'show' to biao, and so when I see 'shou-biao' hand-show it is easy for me to remember that as wrist-watch (in english its literally wrist+watch which also helps me remember the english word in english). And when I see 'biao-shi' I'm used to seeing biao as show and shi as a stage, so biao-shi meaning 'express' is easy for me to recall in my mind when I see biao-show and shi-stage. I think to myself mm those keywords vaguely help me recall that biaoshi means 'express'. The keywords don't even have to make sense necessarily for the word - its just having any keyword, gives me somewhere to start attaching new information for vocabulary. (Like \u9b54\u5c0a for demon-lord, i already see those as demon-lord, or \u5e08\u5c0a teacher-lord as revered teacher, \u6de1\u6de1\u7684 light+word that makes adjectives sometimes so the word is easy to remember as lightly\uff0c \u5076\u50cf even this word for idol i see as 'ou in occasionally' and 'like/similar' and idol is just easier for me to remember - because I am already familiar with the characters. So if I struggle to recognize it I could make up a mnemonic for it, \"I would love to occasionally be like my idol.\" But I usually don't even do that. It is just that, for me, if I know anything at all about a character individually, then a new word with it becomes easier to remember. But if I know nothing about the new characters, then the new words are a struggle to even recognize after 20 times of seeing them. \n\nNow this could just be because of the personal way I tend to remember things, but because of it books like Heisig's, Kodanshi Kanji Learner's Guide, Alan Hoenig's Chinese Characters, and Tuttles Learning Chinese Characters and Reading and Writing Chinese Characters have all been especially valuable to me. Simply because any mnemonic at all, any breakdown of hanzi into their radicals at all, helps me recognize hanzi much easier and also remember and recognize words that contain them much faster. When I did just rote memorization only, it was so hard for me to get anything to stick. Even just the ideas in these books, that I then apply without them, have helped a lot. When I memorized 2000 words with flashcards, even though I did not use Heisig's book, I did use the mnemonic ideas to help me learn those words. So... I do find that even as imperfect, very shallow tools that only cover a very tiny aspect of characters and rarely words, they work for me as a starting piece that I can use to attach other things I learn to with less struggle than if I hadn't used them.\n\nThat said - I preferred 3 other books over Heisig's. I value Heisig's book for the idea of suggesting mnemonics to help recognize characters, and its decent if there's no other option to aid in memory. But I found better alternatives for chinese. I hated that Heisig's book 1 - does not contain mnemonics for every single hanzi (since that is what I found most valuable about it), and 2 - does not include pinyin (since as you mentioned above in your post, often a radical within a hanzi has to do with pronunciation, and knowing pronunciation is required to type hanzi, so its very limiting to skip at least being able to access that information). \n\nI preferred Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters, as a beginner. Because it had 800 commonly used characters, included mnemonics to learn meaning and the prounciation and tone for every hanzi in the book, and it included HSK vocabulary words that use those characters. It also included multiple meanings for common hanzi that are often used in a few main ways. While it had its weak points, as a basic hanzi and vocabulary resource it was decent. Because it covered useful common hanzi, and its mnemonic system was very solid, it was easy to quickly pick up the ability to recognize a lot of hanzi by working through the book. And then, jumping into learning vocabulary was not daunting because I often knew both hanzi in a word, and usually at least 1 hanzi in a new word. And as I mentioned above, even if the 'meaning' I attached to a hanzi has nothing to do with a new word, just knowing something about the hanzi that are part of a new word make it so much easier for me to recognize and remember the new word for me personally. I found that book much more approachable as a beginner, and directly applicable, than Heisig's book. Also because it included pinyin, I was prepared to sound out/type/lookup many new words I ran into, or would only need to learn the second character in some new words. \n\nThe next most helpful book I think was Tuttle Reading and Writing Chinese Characters. Because it included hanzi with pinyin, stroke order, and related HSK vocabulary words. Sometimes the entries had mnemonics, sometimes they just had some 'memory aid' suggestion for the hanzi. As a reference, I've found it valuable, as a memory aid I find mnemonics work better for me. But overall, I think it gives much more to work with and then a learner can supplement the rest with their own memory aids - compared to Heisig's book. And, like the other Tuttle book, this includes HSK vocabulary to an extent so there's some vocabulary exposure. It's not perfect (I liked the 800 Hanzi book better), but it has been valuable to me, and more valuable than Heisig's. \n\nFinally, Alan Hoenig's Chinese Characters - which feels like an alternative to Heisig that does almost the same thing. I like Alan Hoenig's book better, because it 1 - contains mnemonics for every single entry so a learner does not need to struggle to come up with something if that is hard for them, and 2 - includes pinyin for every single entry. I feel that, as a substitue for the Heisig book: it does everything Heisig's book offered and a bit more, by giving mnemonics for each hanzi in the book to give a learner at least a piece to help start recognizing hanzi, and by including pinyin if a learner would like to study/reference that at the same time. If a student is just using a hanzi reference book to roughly get a recognition of hanzi before moving onto learning actual vocabulary, then I think this book compared to Heisig is a better tool for it. As at least with this book, they'll quickly have something to attach to each hanzi to give them some basis (even if ultimately its just a rough tool to discard once they learn actual vocabulary) and they'll actually be exposed to the pronunciation enough to hopefully start recognizing that it sometimes has something to do with a hanzi's pronunciation or meaning.\n\nTo me, all of these tools are nothing compared to learning actual words. They are just something to start building a rough recognition of the characters, so that once you encounter real words you have something to build off of as you start trying to recognize pieces of them and attach their real meanings and varied meanings in words. (Like how in english we see \"carpet\" and even though a carpet is not a car-pet, recognizing those pieces may make the word easier to remember and recognize the next time we see it, compared to something that looks completely unknown like 'sdscsa' to us, we may look up a meaning like 'piece of a tree' and need to look it up in a dictionary 20 times before we remember it, just because we can't attach it to any prior 'thing' we have already established in our minds.) That is a poor example, I'm sorry. I'm tired I realize this is probably a mess to read...", "created_utc": "1604278043.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gaulv1l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jm3zdn", "parent_id": "t3_jm3zdn", "score": "7", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you so much for making this!

Short answer: no. Like any language, it has rules it generally follows, and they make sense. It may take longer than a language more similar to your native language (depending on your native language) would take to learn. It may take x-times more months/years to reach the same milestones you would make in a language more similar to your own potentially. But it is not harder.\n\nLonger answer: I really loved japanese's grammar when I did study it - but I am going to have to wait a while to get back to it. I found it overall easy to understand. The main struggle to me was hearing/looking at japanese sentences and quickly intuitively interpreting them, or wanting to say/write something and quickly determining how to express it. It took me extra time to parse out the japanese and rephrase it in my head into a structure I was more familiar with. And when expressing, it took me extra time to reword how I'd say something in english, into a very different word order and way of expressing than I was used to. So I just felt it was going to take me more time to get quick at those processes, and used to quickly intepreting/expressing in that structure. Whereas with french, the structure is so similar to english that if I know the words I can almost instantly understand sentences - or just struggle for a very short period to understand the pieces of structure that are different from english. Likewise, in french if I want to express myself I can almost instantly do so if I know the words, because usually the structure is similar and the differences in structure still make a lot of 'intuitive' sense to me so I pick them up quickly. With japanese, even when I know all the words, the structure is just so different from what seems intuitive to me that I struggle to interpret or express quickly. I think that process alone just meant my progress in understanding/speaking was going to lag behind how fast progress would be in a language similar to english. Likewise - the writing system is so different, that while it makes sense to me, it takes more time for me to adapt to writing and reading than french did. French only had a few differences in letters, and a lot of spelling rules that just 'seemed intuitive' so I rarely had to think when writing. \n\nWith japanese, there was a hurdle of learning kanji that simply takes a while, and also learning their readings and how those readings change and getting used to remember the hiragana grammar spellings (which were the easiest part - hiragana and verb endings were the most 'intuitive' for me to quickly pick up on). So just... because of all those things, it simply took longer for me to hit milestones of progress in japanese. Japanese was just as 'easy' in terms of grammar that made sense, etc. Its just I had few cognates to rely on, a new writing system to learn, and the structure was so different it was taking me longer to 'quickly/intuitively' get used to doing it the correct way.\n\nAs a fun comparison - I started studying chinese last August, and it's been shockingly quicker for me to make progress in then japanese was. I think a big reason is just chinese grammar 'intuitively' makes sense compared to the way I think of sentences/ideas, whereas japanese is just so different from how I think of expressing ideas. So I got to the point of reading/hearing chinese words I know and immediately interpreting them much quicker than I did with japanese. Another major difference I think helped me - I tried to read chinese from the very beginning, and tried to read novels and watch shows from about 5 months in. Actively making myself read/listen and giving myself more exposure and time to get used to the writing system and aspects of the language I find harder to pick up on, I believe helped a lot. Whereas with japanese, I didn't try to challenge myself that way - so I was not getting much practice trying to read/listen as fast as real speech very often, I wasn't practicing reading kanji/hiragana/katakana to such a great degree everyday, I was not exposing myself to the different sentence structure so frequently. I think if I'd exposed myself more frequently to japanese, I could have sped up the progress I was making a bit.\n\nHowever, I do think to an extent, rough guides like the FSI guide for how long it will take to learn a language are good starting points. Even if a language is easy as far as being easy to learn the material, I think some languages if they're less similar to ones you already know, just sort of take longer to 'get used to.' And the timelines FSI gives have roughly matched what time I've put into my studied languages versus progress I've made. Japanese took roughly 4 times the amount of time to hit the same progress milestone I would hit in french (so 6 months of french to start reading basic texts on the internet, versus 2 years in japanese). With chinese it has been slightly easier than japanese, but I've also put in more daily study time, so my progress has roughly been if it took X hours in french to hit a milestone then its taking 2X hours in chinese to reach the same milestone. \n\nAlso... languages just take time to learn. All language learning is 'difficult' in the sense it will take a good study plan for you, personal goals based on your needs/wants in the language, and then effort over a period of time. French was 'difficult' in the sense it was hard to keep myself motivated and continuously challenging myself with new things to learn and improve. In some ways Chinese has been 'easier' than French simply because all this study experience really taught me how I study most efficiently, make the best goals for myself, and how I best hit my study goals. So my Chinese study plan is way more efficient (which is likely why its only taking 2x as long to hit milestones as in french, instead of 3x or 4x as long).", "created_utc": "1604095930.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gan83rh", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jl35xt", "parent_id": "t3_jl35xt", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "I am extremely excited to hear that someone is planning to make some audio for the chapters, as I have loved this book but that is the one thing hard to come by about it!

It keeps me feeling motivated. \n\nHowever, I do think in some ways I could have brute-force memorized less words and understood them more easily, if I had studied more characters in the very beginning. I think I had a risk of burning out though if I had spent too much time on characters, and that could have risked me giving up/studying less out of avoidance. So I'm glad I went back and forth between character study versus sentences/words, as needed.", "created_utc": "1603804911.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ga9ps74", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jedrz7", "parent_id": "t3_jedrz7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "MassImmersionApproach", "subreddit_id": "t5_rw8og"}, {"author": "mejomonster", "body": "Thank you for sharing your routine like this, clearly with what you've done.

Right now mtlnovel.com allows people to read the RAW chinese, then the machine translated english - but it is by paragraph, not sentence. So if someone wanted to use it a bit as a reading tool, its a bit challenging for beginners. It would be really cool to have a feature like this but designed on purpose to compare the sentences. (Its one of the few features of beelingua app I like - that each sentence is highlighted together so you can compare).\n\nFor chinese, I have only found Reader tools that translate word by word. I believe Readibu allows sentence-translation but you must buy a subscription to access that feature. I think beelingua also allows sentence translation, but when I tried the free version it did allow sentence by sentence only - no word by word translations from what I could tell, and it only allowed reading of material provided by the app (so I can't import/use my own reading material). Languagetools.io has a Reading Tool but it only does word by word. So for the most part, with chinese I have not found any readers that do both. I am not sure if LingQ allows sentence translations but the cost per month was too much for me. DuChinese.com provides sentence and word translations (so i prefer it to beelingua app), but again it has the issue of only allowing you to read materials provided by the site. No Reader functions to read websites or import your own reading material etc.\n\nIf you do know of other Reader apps/sites that provide sentence and word translations, please let me know! Especially if they're free or affordable or one time cost etc. For French, I only know of Languagetools.io Reading Tool, and Idiom app which both just do word by word (and beelingua which I don't like because you can't read your own material). For Chinese, I only know a few places where you can find sentence translations but the tradeoff is no ability to click for individual word definitions. For Chinese all the useful Readers I've ended up using have been all word-by-word only. (Of which Pleco has been the best, because I can look up individual words, hear full text audio, bookmark/flashcard words - it has a  built in srs flashcard system I don't use but some people might, and can read online or my pdfs/txts/other files. The only thing Pleco struggles with is it cannot provide parallel texts, and cannot provide sentence translations - so if you cannot figure out a sentence because of grammar, or misinterpret it, you will need to copy/paste sentences into a separate translation app, and you cannot keep track of how many words you've looked up or learned like with LingQ).\n\nedit: What is Jorkens?", "created_utc": "1603287684.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g9jfnlp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jeljkw", "parent_id": "t1_g9hf6pg", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}]
