Apart from that its just the good ol\u2019 hard work and consistency that helped me get to B1. \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo for the resources: \n\nCoursebooks/Books: \n\n- \u201ePolish, an essential grammar\u201d It\u2019s not a very easy to digest book but will cover all the groundwork of cases, conjugation etc \n\n- \u201ePolish Tutor\u201d, a good follow up book that is more broad in its approach and takes you from A2 to B2\n\n- \u201ePolski Mega Test\u201d, A massive book of grammar drills, language tests etc. Practical if you need to work on one skill in particular and need tons of exercises to hammer it in your head!\n\n- \u201ePolish short stories for beginners\u201d Very similar looking to Olly Richards books, except each paragraph has the translation under.\n\nApps:\n\nI\u2019ve tried many apps for Polish but none of them really satisfied me. When I have a moment I use Okydoky and I also an SR app for new vocab but that\u2019s it. The apps that are imo really good for language learning (like Speakly etc) don\u2019t have a Polish section so \u2026\n\nPodcasts: \n\n- Polish with John. A Polish guy who records himself on diverse topics, gives transcripts and exercises on his website. He\u2019s also a tutor on italki and I had lessons with him there for a while, he\u2019s a great guy! \n\n- Real Polish. This guy has recorded hundreds of mini stories in Polish, plus he has a YouTube channel. He seems to be a very sweet man and very devoted to his work. The subscription to his podcast is super cheap and very worth it imo. \n\n- Slow Polish. Aleksandra has a YouTube channel and also recently created a podcast. As the name suggested she speaks super slowly in Polish which helps! \n\n- Easy Polish. The Polish version of the famous street interviews channels! \n\nFinally I want to recommend my FAVOURITE resource of all time, I keep raving about it because I think it\u2019s such a brillant resource. It\u2019s called \u201ePolak Potrafi\u201d. It\u2019s a series of over 30 PDFs going from A2 to C2!! Each PDF is about the life of a famous Polish person, with a biography, wide range of exercises (even audio) etc. It\u2019s just brillant!\n\nhttp://fundacjareja.eu/polak-potrafi-spis-tresci/\n\nI hope this will help some of you!!
