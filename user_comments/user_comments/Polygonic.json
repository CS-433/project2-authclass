My own US insurance company is about to pay me out for having my car stolen in TJ last month. The catch is that a US insurance company **cannot** cover **liability** within Mexico. Unless you are absolutely sure you will not damage anyone else or their property, you should be getting a basic liability policy from a Mexican insurance company. If you, for example, hit someone else's car with your RV and cause $10,000 in damage, without a Mexican insurance policy you very well could sit in a Mexican jail until someone comes up with $10,000 to give to the person whose car you damaged. They are **not required** to accept any US insurance for liability purposes. This is not a joke.  I personally get a $500,000 liability policy from a Mexican insurer, and the couple hundred dollars a year is well worth the peace of mind.

Or *el caballo* and *la yegua* (*caballo* means horse in general, but also \"stallion\", while *yegua* means \"mare\", the female horse.)\n* Finally, there are some where the gender of the word does **not** change -- for example, *la pantera* or *el cuervo*.  If it's a male panther, it's \"*la pantera macho*\". If it's a female crow, it's \"*el cuervo hembra*.\"  We never use *el pantero* or *la cuerva* to refer to an animal (*la cuerva* exists, but it has a completely separate meaning from \"crow\").\n\nAnd remember that when we create a sentence, the important thing is the grammatical gender of the **word**, not of the animal.

Different sexes are essentially the same word, but different ending. Examples are *el perro/la perra*, *el gato/la gata,* and *el lagarto/la lagarta* (that's \"lizard\", by the way).\n2. Different words for each sex of an animal. Examples are *el caballo/la yegua* (horse, or stallion/mare), *el macho/la cabra* (goat), and *el carnero/la oveja* (sheep, or ram/ewe).\n3. One word of an unchanging gender for both sexes. Examples are *la ara\u00f1a* (spider), *el dinosaurio*, or *el gorila*. \n\n**Usually**, but not always, the masculine is used to refer to a group as a whole. So a mixed group of cats would be *los gatos*. But there are a few animals where the feminine is used for a group, such as *las ovejas*, and *las vacas*. Obviously if the animal word is an unchanging feminine, it's used instead, such as *las jirafas* for a group of giraffes of any sex.\n\nIf we want to specify that an animal whose word has unchanging gender is the other sex, we can say \"male\" or \"female\": For example, *Tengo una ara\u00f1a macho y un gorila hembra.* Note that articles, adjectives, etc. have to agree with the gender of the **word**.  *El gorila hembra est\u00e1 enfermo*. \n\nAnd finally, if the animal is \"personalized\", so that it has a name, then we can switch the gender of adjectives used if we refer to the name itself. For example: *Tengo una nueva ara\u00f1a peque\u00f1a que se llama Pablo. Pablo es negro y amarillo.* So even though Pablo is *una ara\u00f1a*, we use masculine adjectives if we call him by name.\n\nHope all that helps! :)", "created_utc": "1663888928.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipj976w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xl6aw0", "parent_id": "t1_ipj5zux", "score": "26", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "Where they looking for Clinton's emails?\n\nIn the basement of the Ping Pong Pizza!", "created_utc": "1663885524.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipj23wx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xl0sii", "parent_id": "t1_ipioloj", "score": "6", "subreddit": "ParlerTrick", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ffh5p"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "My Mexican insurance is through Chubb", "created_utc": "1663885274.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipj1kev", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xl3dyv", "parent_id": "t1_ipiy0s7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tijuana", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qk9t"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "Yes, that's up there where I said that \"some animals have two forms\".", "created_utc": "1663885245.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipj1i2w", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xl6aw0", "parent_id": "t1_ipixcv4", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "Well it's worth several thousand dollars for me to report it, so I'm damn well going to report it! :D", "created_utc": "1663885219.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipj1fwp", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_xl3dyv", "parent_id": "t1_ipiw3b4", "score": "3", "subreddit": "tijuana", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qk9t"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "I have long chosen to accept that theory as fact and challenge you to change my mind.", "created_utc": "1663882000.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipiu53l", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xl66fl", "parent_id": "t1_ipitwvr", "score": "13", "subreddit": "ShitAmericansSay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w57u"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "I came here to say, \"And people ask me why I have an apartment in Tijuana...\"\n\n$800 for a 2br in a pretty quiet residential area.", "created_utc": "1663881917.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipity1a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xkue2l", "parent_id": "t1_iphy9s9", "score": "8", "subreddit": "SanDiegan", "subreddit_id": "t5_3f157"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "Gracias, si! :)", "created_utc": "1663881677.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipitdkc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xl6aw0", "parent_id": "t1_ipijmpr", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "I don't think the ZR Apple Watch app is anything more than a \"second screen\" so you can see your progress in the ZR app while having your phone in your pocket.

Like if you hear \"la hombre come\" then you know there was something wrong and can ask the person to repeat themselves.\n\nAnother is that it can make disambiguation easier in some sentences. For example, in English, if you asked \"What color shirt and hat would you like?\" the customer would either say \"a yellow shirt and a white hat\", or just say \"yellow and white\" and risk you forgetting which order you asked the objects in.  But in Spanish you could just answer \"amarilla y blanco\" and the first could only go with \"camisa\" and the second could only go with \"blanco\".\n\nBut I think probably the biggest reason is that humans just like to categorize things. Some languages have over ten different \"noun classes\" (the linguistic term for what we call \"gender\") -- Swahili has about 16! And once the gender for things is ingrained, it can speed up linguistic processing. For example, they have done eye tracking experiments with images of two objects with different genders, and as soon as the person hears the article, their eye already starts to jump to the object of that gender even before the brain has processed the word that follows.  For example, a Brazilian looking at a screen with an apple and a book, and when the listener hears \"a...\" the eyes already start tracking to the apple before they heard the word \"ma\u00e7\u00e3\" because they know it can't be \"o livro\".\n\nThis topic comes up pretty often in r/linguistics; I think there's a thread on it at least once a month. ;)", "created_utc": "1662486666.0", "edited": "False", "id": "incatqr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x73d5i", "parent_id": "t1_inbs7dp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": ">Spanish has a \"ma pa ta\" rule where nouns ending in those three sounds are almost always masculine instead of feminine.

I'm not sure how you interpreted that from my comment since I literally said, \"What a US policy cannot cover is liability.\" \n\nI totally agree that having full coverage Mexican insurance makes it easier. I have that myself. I was just trying to make it clear that what is usually called \"comprehensive\" and \"collision\" coverage is not **required** to be from a Mexican company, and that he should consult his own insurance company to see what's covered (hence \"depends on the policy\").  Your comment sounded to me like you were implying that complete coverage was required. When you said, \"Your US policy will not legally cover you in Mexico\", someone could take that to mean that US policies are no good at all down there, which is not true -- just the liability portion is ineffective.", "created_utc": "1661377086.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilnfk47", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ww3hdb", "parent_id": "t1_ilnc525", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tijuana", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qk9t"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "Start a new streak and be more careful this time", "created_utc": "1661369963.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilmwqny", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wws84j", "parent_id": "t3_wws84j", "score": "10", "subreddit": "duolingo", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t6ze"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "I would say \"**Las** hermosas Ana y Sofia\".", "created_utc": "1661367303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilmpphz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwrf4a", "parent_id": "t3_wwrf4a", "score": "9", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "Many gun owners (including some I know personally), I think live every day with the idea that they are carrying a weapon for the chance that they can \"be the hero\" when a \"bad guy\" tries to do something bad.", "created_utc": "1661366858.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilmojd8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwh9nm", "parent_id": "t1_ill6mai", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ShitAmericansSay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w57u"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "As I've tried to explain to people: In Switzerland, having your gun at home is a matter of civic **duty** (defend the country), and therefore it's all treated as a big responsibility.\n\nIn the US it's treated as a civil **right** which means in many places there's no attempt to link it to being responsible at all; just \"own a gun because you have the right to, no need to have any classes or safety training.\"", "created_utc": "1661366735.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilmo7lo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwh9nm", "parent_id": "t1_ilm0ud9", "score": "16", "subreddit": "ShitAmericansSay", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w57u"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "In my personal case, I actually use three different apps when I go for a run.

Pronunciation is another matter, but that's not really a major focus as this subreddit is primarily about the text of Spanish, since we don't have audio here.\n\nBut on the note of spoken Spanish, two resources I've personally used that are focused more on Spanish as spoken in Spain rather than more general Spanish, are:\n\n* The podcast \"Coffee Break Spanish\" - this is a Spanish teaching podcast which is produced in Glasgow, Scotland, and primarily teaches the language as spoken in Spain. \n* The YouTube channel \"Linguriosa\"  - Not so much a teaching series, but is mainly videos about the history and origins of Spanish, in Spanish, made by a Spanish woman from Madrid.\n\nHope those will help you in your journey, but I think you will find useful help here as well!", "created_utc": "1660071091.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijm6yhy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wkawyd", "parent_id": "t3_wkawyd", "score": "10", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "They'll totally spin it as being like one of those action movies where the Hero intentionally gets put in jail so he can break someone else out or expose the evil prison warden or some shit", "created_utc": "1660064808.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijlq0jd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wjrldl", "parent_id": "t1_ijk0ojv", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Qult_Headquarters", "subreddit_id": "t5_in7k7"}, {"author": "Polygonic", "body": "The \"new mix\" of WHAT?

And the top level has restaurants including \"La Cerve\" which is a nice casual mexican seafood restaurant. My apartment is only a five minute drive from the Galerias so I often go over there for food.\n\nA good family park for relaxing and people watching is Parque Teniente Guerrero which is downtown between 3rd and 4th street (it's an entire city block). It's a pretty traditional Mexican family park, with old men playing chess, a gazebo where sometimes music is playing, and lots of food vendor carts around the perimeter.\n\nI will second the other suggestion to go to Gastropark Telefonica. With all the various food trucks there, there's sure to be some food to interest everyone. My favorite is the hot dogs with bacon sauce!\n\nAlso more in the downtown area, the restaurant \"El Museo\" (corner of Revolution and 1st street) is a nice casual place that has a lot of pictures of old Tijuana and artifacts from days gone by. I like going there in the afternoon and watching the people strolling by on the sidewalk outside (big windows to the outside).

There's also an aquarium with marine animals and a relaxing sculpture garden!\n\nAlong those same lines, a couple people have mentioned El Trompo the childrens science museum that I'm told is pretty cool. And some people may laugh at this, but I think kids would like the Wax Museum (\"Museo de Cera\") that has wax figures of famous celebrities and important historical figures from Mexican history. It's a bit dated, but I've brought guests there and they all think it's pretty fun.\n\nIf your kids are into sports, the Tijuana major league football (real football, not American football) team is playing a home game Saturday night.  Unfortunately the baseball team is playing away games all this week, and basketball season is over.\n\nOh, but there's a sporting event you can only see in Mexico: There's a Mexican Professional Wrestling (\"Lucha Libre\") event at the Municipal Auditorium on Friday (July 29th)!

It's a small museum downtown that has a HUGE collection of three types of things: Artifacts associated with Tijuana, Collectible toys and action figures, and Mexican Wrestling memorabilia.  I think kids of all ages would love it. It's only open Friday to Sunday, 10am to 6pm.  Their web site is here ([https://mucoti.com.mx/](https://mucoti.com.mx/)) and has some images that can give you an idea of what the collection is like.\n\nA couple of food suggestions -- a first trip to Tijuana should include a visit to Caesar's Restaurant, which is where the Caesar Salad was invented. They make your Caesar salad right at the table which is pretty cool. I also think the kids would like a very \"Mexican\" restaurant called \"Cantina de Los Remedios\"; it's very family friendly and I think they will love the ceiling art (huge pictures of \"La Loteria\" which is sort of a Mexican \"bingo\" style game). Cantina de los Remedios is right on a traffic circle in the middle of which is a big statue of Abraham Lincoln, which is... well, a weird thing to have in Tijuana, but there you go.\n\nWhile I'm at it, someone else mentioned the \"Pasaje Rodriguez\" alley, which is right next to the downtown Caliente Casino.
