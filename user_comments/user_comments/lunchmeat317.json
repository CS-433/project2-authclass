It seems that you don't lack the skillset to do that (which is the important part) but instead lack the desire. I don't think this is uncommon.\n\nIn terms of getting out - instead of group activities, you may consider solo activities. You may enjoy going for a bike ride alone or hiking (walking) alone, or maybe you enjoy rock climbing or something. Outside of exercise, there are many hobbies that people have that can be solitary in nature, like arts/crafts, music, cooking, camping, etc - basically anything that forces you to create instead of consume. These also count as life experiences and actually can give you talking points.\n\nThe main issue with your hobby is that there's not really any creation happening - it's all consumption. (Watching anime is basically just watching TV, which fundamentally is a really passive activity - you don't actually do anything, and there's nothing produced when you finish.) However, you can find interesting things to do that dovetail with your current hobby. For example, many people watch anime and decide to learn Japanese, which creates a lot of opportunities. Learning a new language is inherently social, it's a great talking point, and it's a hobby that actively produces something. Additionally, for you, as an anime lover, learning Japanese would not only allow you to reduce your reliance on subtitles but would also allow you to watch and read stuff that simply isn't available in English.\n\nI don't think you necessarily have to force yourself to have cookie-cutter life experiences just to fit in better with other vanilla people. You already have social skills. I do think that you should try out some new solo activities, and I do think that you should look for activities that relate to your main hobby - like learning Japanese.", "created_utc": "1665244928.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irizdgd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xy71sb", "parent_id": "t3_xy71sb", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskMenOver30", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y9pw"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Dude....if you want to improve your French, use you existing skills and make friends with a native speaker.

Thinking about this more, I'm not sure if this is actually a voiced S - rather, I think that this happens due to the fact that the stressed syllable ends with an S.\n\nAs an example - I think if you asked a native speaker to pronounce the word really slowly, they wouldn't voice the S in either of those words - but when spoken at a regular speed, since those syllables are accented, there may be a tendency to voice the S. You can in fact see this when people say a word a specific way; an example of this would be the word \"asco\", which could have a voiced S in regular speech due to the accented syllable. But when someone says something like \"ay, qu\u00e9 ascoooooo\", you'll notice that the S is never voiced! It's  never \"qu\u00e9 azzzzco\" (English phonetics) but always \"qu\u00e9 aaassscooooo\", and natives will draw out that S sound without voicing it. (Edit: Also, note that when if the S is voiced, it's not nearly as strong a sound as the English Z buzzing sound. It's a more subtle sound - kind of somewhere between an unvoiced S and a voiced Z.)\n\nThe examples I provided - \"desmadre\", \"desmayar\", and \"esdr\u00fajula\", don't have the stress on the syllable that ends with an S, and thus would never exhibit this phenomenon.\n\nI honestly never thought about this and it's kind of interesting. Based on the patterns I've seen and the fact that I'm thinking deeper about this, I would still say that this sound doesn't officially exist in Spanish - it just happens sometimes when the *stressed* syllable in a word ends with an S and is followed by a consonant.\n\nBet the natives here can come up with more examples!", "created_utc": "1660370160.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ik3i2j6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wn1rew", "parent_id": "t1_ik32unq", "score": "0", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Ohh, got it.

The S consonants in those words aren't voiced - if that does happen, it's purely by accident.

In the study section, it would be nice to focus on grammar drills - using various conjugations, moods, tenses, cases, etc, in the correct spoken and written structure. This could be a really valuable tool in improving general fluency, especially for intermediates.\n\nOverall, I think it's a great idea and it's honestly something that I've wanted for a long time (but I never wanted to go down the programming rabbit hole to do it, as that's time lost on other stuff). I would like to use a tool like this to do spoken grammar drills for specific grammatical structures in Spanish, or even have guided conversations that forced me to use specific grammatical structures to respond correctly; examples for me include talking about past events (\"I was going to the store when I saw...\"), talking about hypothetical situations (\"If I were a rich man, I would...\"), or talking about reported speech (\"this person said that X would go to Y, but that Z had already gone to A\"). Being able to drill structures like this in a study session and then use them in a simulated conversation would be really beneficial; to me, that would be a better use of your platform than the standard flashcard offering.\n\nHope this helps.

Ignorming pronunciation is not. To provide some examples:\n\n- Mandarin Chinese\n  - Alex's speed and cadence when speaking mark them as a non-native speaker, but they are intelliglble. (Accent)\n  - Blake consistently pronounces a word and uses the wrong tone, it's objectively incorrect and natives commonly misinterpret the word. (Pronunciation)\n  - Blake fails to adequately distinguish between the \"s\" and 'x\" initial sounds in Mandarin, as well as the \"q\" and \"ch\" initials, creating ambiguity (Pronunciation)\n  - CHAD decides that \"toans R 2 hard\" and decides to forget about them altogether. (Pronunciation)\n- Spanish\n  - Alex speaks at a high level, but their vowels tend to turn into dipthongs, which marks them as a non-native speaker (even though they are inteiigible and identifiable as the correct vowels). (Accent)\n  - Blake's speech doesn't provide enough distinction between vowels in general, creating ambiguity and causing problems with comprehension of conjugated verbs for native speakers. (Pronunciation)\n  - CHAD decides \"pure vouals rr 2 hard\", replaces all vowels in Spanish with the \"schwa\" sound, and ignores syllable accent rules. (Pronunciation)\n- English\n  - Alex speaks at a high level but their speech patterns tend to avoid use of the \"schwa\" sound, resulting in pure vowels and their speaking cadence is syllable-timed. (Accent)\n  - Blake fails to make a strong-enough distinction between high-importance phonemes in English words (which vary based on the word and the stress pattern of the word), and there is little or no distinction between words like \"beach\" and \"bitch\", \"tear\" and \"dear\", and \"kiss\" and \"keys\". (Pronunciation)\n  - CHAD decides \"English is hard as fuck and makes no sense, the pronunciation and phonetics are shit and don't match the orthography at all, fuck this\" (can't blame them) and decides to pronounce words like \"meat\" like \"me-at\". (Pronunciation)\n\nI hope this helps to illustrate the difference. The first example in each category is an example where an accent would mark you as a non-native in that area, but would be acceptable. The others are pronunciation issues that would result in bad comprehension or misunderstandings in speech, and the last example of each one is that one asshole who just won't even try and feels completely justified in doing so.\n\nHaving an accent is acceptable.

Having a non-native accent is one thing, and that doesn't necessarily have to hold you back. Ignoring pronunciation, on the other hand, is not acceptable and is something that can and should be fixed. Accents generally don't affect comprehension by natives as much as we think, but bad pronunciation of the core sounds of a language can cause grave issues with comprehension.

Things to know:\n\n- You want to be familiar with a certain exercise so you don't have to read the instructions. Reading the instructions burns time.\n- You want to be familiar with the time they give you for things like reading questions before audio starts, etc.\n- You want to be familiar with the time you'll spend on the entire test, as it is timed. Staying on pace is important, so you'll want to know how many sections each section has - and the difficulty progression of each section.\n- You want to be aware of the scoring rules and plan accordingly. (I believe - but you'll want to verify this - that you lose points for wrong answers, but you don't lose points for questions you don't answer, due to the nature of the test. As such, if you are testing for a specific level, you can use the time allotted to nail that level and skip the rest.)\n\nAs for your actual skillset - I personally believe that you're either ready for it or you aren't. I took the SIELE Global and achieved 821/1000 points, but I didn't do specific test study aside from doing sample tests and knowing what to expect testwise. I wanted to verify my CEFR level in the language, not beat a specific goal. If, however, you haven't scheduled your test and don't plan to schedule it unless you know you can reach that level, then I think that your practice should generally follow the four competencies - reading, writing, listening, and speaking.\n\n- Practice monologuing and record your monologues.

Example:\n\n- You are going to the store\n- Are you going to the store\n\nWithout punctuation, you can deduce which phrase is a declaration and which one is a question. However, in Spanish, the same two phrases:\n\n- Vas a la tienda\n- Vas a la tienda\n\n...are equivalent and there's no way to know what type of phrase it is.\n\nThe punctuation that we use in English could indicate the difference. But, you would only know by the time you reach the end of the phrase, which - for purposes of spoken intonation - would be too late. It doesn't seem like a big deal, right? However, given that phrases in Spanish tend to be longer than equivalent phrases in English and that questions and exclamations can exist as subphrases inside a longer sentence, having an indicator of the phrase type becomes important.

I did some language exchanges and have made some lasting friendships - I now talk to people on Whatsapp.\n- Right now, I'm going back and really studying Spanish grammar, which helps me to be more precise when I speak and especially when I write.\n- One thing that I need to do in Spanish is read more native content, and actively improve vocab. I've considered using Readlang for this.\n\nYou can look at areas of focus within language learning - the core competencies of reading, writing, listening, and speaking, as well as foundational elements, like grammar, vocab, pronunciation, writing systems, etc - and for those areas, you can set specific goals (if you want to). Gamified systems are good at doing this type of thing for you so you don't have to, but if you know what you want to practice you can easily supplement your activities with other things that will help.\n\nAs you continue, you'll get a better idea of what you need to work on.

(There's a small style guide there.)\n- There's a site for advanced Spanish, here: https://www.espanolavanzado.com/. There are a lot of good articles on that site about the usage of specific words and verbs - as you're heritage, this might not be as helpful to you, but I'm putting it here anyway.

I haven't checked this out and so I don't know how effective it is or how localized it is, but it may help.\n- Finally - a great resource for writing is the Diccionario panhispanico de dudas - https://www.rae.es/dpd/.

So, as others have stated, in Spanish there are much longer phrases and more uses of appositives. Sometimes, where we would split a phrase in English with a period, a comma would be used in Spanish.\n\nThere are other rules as well for prose.\n\n- Appositives can be marked with em dashes, and the em dashes don't have a space between the dash and the clause itself, like so: \"According to what I know -which isn't much- Americans don't speak other languages.\"\n- Where a semicolon would be used to split a phrase in English, a comma would be used in Spanish.\n- ~~Lists of things in Spanish don't use semicolons in a phrase (but I don't remember what's used; I believe it's a colon).~~ This might not be correct, but I feel I've seen this usage somewhere.\n- The comma usage for common connector words in Spanish like \"however\" (sin embargo) and others like that are actually different also - these words won't often start a sentence (instead coming after a comma as part of a larger phrase) and often won't have a comma after it. As an example: \"Quiero ir al ba\u00f1o, sin embargo no puedo porque est\u00e1 ocupado.\" In English, this would be: \"I want to go to the bathroom. However, I can't, because it's occupied.\" Note the difference. You will see this usage in longer phrases.\n\nThe best thing to do might actually be to look up a style manual in Spanish and compare it to the English equivalent. There's a good guide here (https://www.rae.es/dpd/signos%20ortogr%C3%A1ficos) that I haven't read yet, but I'm going to devote time to it.\n\nBut to your question - yes, they are different. Your students may be applying the style rules from their native language to their target language, or they may actively be trying not to do that and overcompensating in terms of punctuation in order to try to get it right. It's worth noting that this is common and it can be hard to know what \"good\" style is without reading a lot of material in the target language.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nDouble Edit: See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/vqqgw7/are_punctuation_rules_different_in_spanish_than/iespsz1/) by /u/Dramatic-Arrival603 for a direct link to the RAE article on the \"coma\" and its usage.

The positive is that you spelled the majority of the Spanish words correctly. The negative is - as others have said - that there are some issues with what you wrote from a correctness perspective. This is broken Spanish.\n\nTo better understand what others are saying, take a look at this English example:\n\n> Using will I below hour toward tried toward make out it I percepting ability with along inscripted talents language on, walking myself kept practice toward better the have.\n\nThis is weirdly broken English, in the same way that your Spanish is weirdly broken Spanish.\n\nOne very important thing for you at this stage is to realize that taking an English sentence and translating every word into the first Spanish entry from the dictionary does *not* yield a Spanish sentence. (I did this in school also. I think most students do this at least once.) It just yields broken Spanish.\n\nHere are some resources I think you should check out:\n\n- Duolingo. The Duolingo Spanish course will teach you basics and beyond for reading and writing Spanish - but more importantly, from the starting level, you'll start to see how even basic phrases differ in their core construction from English. (Example - \"My name is X\" becomes \"me llamo X\" and \"I am 35 years old\" becomes \"tengo 35 a\u00f1os\". Even the number of words in the basic phrase is different, meaning you can't do a word-by-word translation and get it right.) Duolingo won't get you fluent in a target language, but it'll help you at this stage with this goal.\n- A good grammar resource. Spanish isn't just English with different words. [There's a really good resource online](https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~eyepes/newgr/ats/) - basically a grammar textbook designed for English speakers - that can supplement your Duolingo learning. You'll need to work with Duolingo to get your Spanish vocab to a nominal level before you can really delve into this content, but it should still be useful at a basic level.\n- Resources on Reddit. WriteStreakES is a subreddit designed for people who want to improve their Spanish writing, and it's checked by native speakers. It's generally more useful after you get to a more advanced level, but it's a place when people will correct your Spanish. (Worth noting that there aren't English natives there, so your Spanish has to at least be intelligible. By that, I mean that they won't be able to magically understand what you're trying to say even if you're butchering the language.)\n\nYou should definitely keep going! What you're doing and the effort you're putting in is good. However, you should build a solid foundation to work from if you want to write correct Spanish, and you need the same foundation if you want to read Spanish that other people write.\n\nGood luck.

Don't settle for anything less than native materials - colombian telenovelas, etc. (Radio ambulante, a podcast sponsored by NPR, is also good, although not restricted to Colombia.) This will take time - a lot of it - but it will work.\n\nFor speaking - one very important thing is learning the Spanish alphabet and its pronunciation.

You won't find much of that here. However, you will start to find more of that content in language-specific subreddits, and I find that it can be more useful to actually have these conversations with native speakers of your target language than native speakers of your home language (which is basically this sub). Often, native speakers of other languages will understand that frustration a little more simply because a lot of people are trying to learn English, and passing for native in English is hard.\n\nYou may also consider speaking to linguists, who may have more answers to your questions than the average layman - stuff like \"how does thought affect language and vice-versa\" aren't questions that middle- and high-school kids in a language reddit are gonna be able to answer. But there are answers to your questions - you just have to look in academic spaces for them.\n\nFinally - you will continue improving, little by little. The only advice that I can give is this:\n\n- Find a native speaker who's in your corner. Girlfriend, friend, anyone who is comfortable with you asking questions and with providing explanations.\n- Practice and fail (in high-pressure situations, like a group dinner). When you fail, remember that failure, study it, and try to do better next time.\n- Be okay with using good translators to understand an idiomatic phrase. (The other day, a friend of mine said \"siento que todo se me viene abajo\", a phrase that was never even on my radar. DeepL's translation wasn't just about the words but the sentiment and emotion behind them, and now I'm comfortable with that phrase.) These phrases aren't often obvious and can trip you up at any level.\n\nTL;DR: I hear you, I can relate. Talk to natives and linguists.

I'd rather not be in the deaf community as I do not sign and I had a chance to learn sign many times in my early years of life but chose not to out of ignorance or wanting to stay in the hearing world. The dating in the deaf world is immensely small, limiting your options so no thanks. I don't know why you said it would expand when in fact it would shrink considerably.\n\nMy apologies - I missed that you don't sign at all. That said, not having learned it young doesn't mean that you can't learn it now, if you wish. It won't be a native language for you, but it would be useful in terms of getting to know people that you otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to know (just like learning any other language). I began learning ASL at one point myself.\n\nI said this because even though that community is a subset of the greater whole, that community itself would be larger in a city. You specifically mentioned that dating is difficult for you because you are hard of hearing and it makes social situations difficult for you. I'm offering a way around that obstacle - interacting with people who understand that difficulty - but it does require living in a densely populated area. If you don't want to consider that community, then the only way forward would be for you to overcome that fear and force yourself through social situations, or not try at all.\n\n> Women are not my goal but they add and enrich our lives, especially someone that you can connect with.

Some men do put forth the efforts with no return in value.\n\nRespectfully - if the things that you do and plan to do have little intrinsic value to you and the extrinsic value you seek from your actions is finding a partner, then women are your goal. That's fine if that's the case, but you need to be honest with yourself and with others about it. That said, I think you should focus on other things that have intrinsic value to you; you mentioned family and travel. Friendships can also fall into this category. But I feel as though a lot of people mistakenly attach self-worth to their desirability as a partner and/or their relationship status, which is why I'm suggesting to let that go. Dwelling on lacking a partner and planning all your actions with the end goal of chasing that goal is a rough place to be, mentally and emotionally.

We're around the age where we start to accomplish certain things and begin to lack direction because we've achieved some of the things we wanted and don't know where to go next. You've achieved your physique and you're about to achieve an MBA. You've got a contract role and you're starting to see income. You have achievements. Now it's time to set new goals outside of the dating scene, like paying off that student loan debt and travelling to different places. Maybe there's another skill that you've wanted to pick up but haven't, something personal like art or something. One goal could be moving to a new city (after you've paid off your debt - if you're in a financially stable situation and you have the support of your parents in terms of living, make a solid plan to pay off your debts while you have that support, then plan to move. Take advantage of their generosity and use it to move yourself forward.)\n\nAs for moving to a new place, a bigger city - I would say that this would be an emphatic yes. There are more options for dating, but there are more options for friendship and communities as well. You, being part of the Deaf community, may encounter a lot more support in a large city where you might find other people in your community. You may even find other people who have had similar experiences to yours. Having a community close by can be helpful, even if it may not seem like it. Your dating options can also expand within that community, as some of the problems you've faced simply may be non-issues with someone who understands.\n\nTL;DR: you've made achievements and now you want to know where to go. You need to identify what you want, and then make detailed plans that can move you towards that goal. Goals can be paying off student loads, then travelling, then moving out out after you've cleared your debt. Other goals may be career-oriented. Women should not be the goal. You should consider moving to a city for various reasons related to community, friendship, and variety. There might also be greater support within the Deaf community in a city in terms of dating.\n\nHope this helps.", "created_utc": "1640984102.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hqq696h", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rsm757", "parent_id": "t3_rsm757", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AskMenOver30", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y9pw"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Dude.....what?\n\nI know this is late.

This is only my fourth post in this sub; I paid for the full season on Amazon and ended up coming here after watching the turkey episode and being utterly disappointed.\n\nI can't say that every episode in Season 4 and Season 5 is bad. There are some that I like! However, in these past two seasons, that I don't like is the change of the writing style, the characterization, and changes in the plots, and the humor. I do think that Season 5 is more egregious about it than Season 4, though. I'll try to explain a little, one by one.\n\n- The writing style. While Rick and Morty has always had an element of meta-humor, it's picked up a lot more in recent seasons. The good episodes are good, but the bad episodes just feel lazy. Episodes are more referential to other material instead of relying upon original ideas, concepts and characters, and so it kind of devolves into a lazy parody. Recently, we've just been seeing a lot more straight references to pop culture - and unfortunately, that's been making up a large part of the bad episodes. This began to emerge in Season 4 and has become the core of some episodes in Season 5.\n- The characterization. I've come to understand that there are fanatics in this sub. I don't identify with that, but I do think that some of the characters seem to be written slightly differently. Again, this is becoming more apparent in Season 5 in some ways. (I don't know why, and I may not have good references for this, but I feel as though the characters have been disconnected from the plots in a way - as though stuff is happening around them, but not really with them.) The dialogue is also a lot more \"straight\" - no stutters, fewer ad-libs - and often the referential jokes feel shoehorned in in an awkward way. And some lines are just feel forced, awkward, and out-of-character (Summer referencing the Chief Justice comes to mind).\n- The plots. In earlier episodes, plots were generally caused by actions taken by the main characters. Then, the plot would evolve due to actions taken or not taken. The good episodes still do this to an extent, but the bad ones feel more like plot just happens. I don't know a good way to explain this, but compare something like the Vat of Acid episode or the Meeseeks episode to the turkey episode. In the former, it feels like the characters drive the plot, while in the latter, it feels like the plot just kind of happens. This is exacerbated by the fact that some of the episodes take some one-note gag and run with it for the entire episode, running it into the ground even after it's exhausted. (Heist, Snake Jazz, Vultron, etc.) Combine this with the referential humor and it get disappointing quickly.\n- The humor. Many episodes are more meta and more referential in a different way, and it's not really better. There's some social commentary that's a little too on-the-nose and so feels out of place, there seem to be more references to US history and its figures, and there are blatant references and homages to American pop culture. The pacing has also changed to reflect this, relying more on one-liners to drive the humor instead of the situations and natural character interactions. It's a completely different brand of humor that, in my opinion, has been seen far too often and is slightly lazy. At this point, it's just generic.\n\nSeason 4 wasn't as good as the first three, in my opinion, but I paid for it, watched it, and liked it in general. Season 5 has had two and a half good episodes, bot overall, it feels like a different show entirely. The good episodes are good, but unlike previous seasons, the bad episodes barely feel like the same show at all. It feels generic and derivative now, and I hope that the reasons I expressed above can help to understand why it feels that way to me.", "created_utc": "1627892067.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h7eobka", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ovv8wl", "parent_id": "t1_h7dmcci", "score": "11", "subreddit": "rickandmorty", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u4lp"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Sigh....\n\nThis is better than the turkey episode from last week, but it's not a good episode.\n\nIt starts out pretty well, actually, but it just goes downhill from there. There are actually some good lines thrown in - and the ferret parking garage gag is funny the first time - but after the first gotron scene, it just doesn't go anywhere. After the family creates the team, it just feels like a bad parody that goes on too long... but when the parody anime characters come, it hits rock bottom. But *then*, the episode somehow manages to somehow go beyond rock bottom with Summer's exposition-speak about the baby thing, and it just continues in a downward spiral. It's just bad.\n\nNone of the characters - none of them - feel like themselves, either. (I don't know why, but even the voice acting felt different in this one. It's not, but I guess it's just the personality of the characters and their attitudes. The most egregious example  of changed personality in this episode is Jerry, but I guess that some writer used the existing characters as stand-in shells for the archetypes they wanted to use in their story.) I think it's worth noting that although Summer is actually my favorite character in the show, for a few reasons, this is *far* from her best showing.\n\nThere were a few funny parts that made me chuckle (and the way they acknowledged the shittiness of the voiceover mechanic was worth a chuckle), and the first half of the episode was kind of entertaining (I didn't leave questioning the value of my purchase like I did last week) but it's not a good episode. The writing is off, the characterization is off, the plots are off, and the humor is just *way* off for Rick and Morty.

(As an example, I remember the TV shows I watched as a kid and throughout my youth. I watched a fair amount of TV. What if I'd used that time to learn and understand different things? Would I be a smarter, better person today?) Internet media has supplanted broadcast media today, and it's just as bad in terms of wasting time.\n\nThere are actually some books on this worth reading:\n\n- Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television, by Jerry Mander. He talks about the mental state that watching TV (or any type of video content, really) puts us in, which I found interesting.\n- Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man by Marshall McLuhan. (McLuhan's a little rough to read due to his argument style - feels like a slog - but Jerry Mander references him, so reading McLuhan isn't of utmost necessity. However, the core argument is good and insightful).\n- Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.

The same as standard braces, but they go on the back of your teeth, and so can't be seen from the front.

Timewise - before the pandemic, I was in some sort of rehearsal at least three times per week, and I might be playing a show twice a month or so. (Now, I just kind of pick it up and play when I feel like it - I mess around with my Helix effects and my Aeros looper to make my own music.) In terms of money, I have no idea how much I've spent over the years, but I definitely own thousands of dollars of music equipment. Kind of crazy to think about, actually.\n- Language learning. I speak Spanish and I've made new friends in different countries just by having access to the language - I made a friend through Reddit, one through Tandem, and others through other means. I learned in high school but never mastered it, and I've found that language exchange is a great way to meet new people and learn about different cultures. Now, I'm starting to learn Chinese, and even though I haven't been diligent about it in the last two months, it's still awesome and useful and I've been able to meet new people.

Never \"got good\" but it was something I genuinely enjoyed in high school and college - just the feeling of cruising along (well, until you hit a pebble, anyway). I could ollie and do a frontside 180, and not much else, but I loved bombing hills so much that I actually purchased a longboard that I still own.\n- Traveling. I still like doing this, but it just feels like I haven't really gone anywhere in the last five years.\n\nThings I'd like to get into/need to get into:\n\n- Cooking. I've never been a good cook, and it's always seemed like too much work to try to cook for just me. Cooking stuff isn't so terrible, but I really hate food prep - chopping and peeling and cutting and doing all that stuff. However, I know that it's good for habits and health, so I've got to pick it up.\n- Exercise.

For the drinking portion of this, you have a couple ways of responding:\n\n1. Stop drinking. (This is what I did.) You can stick to non-alcoholic cocktails or just drink soda or juice. This seems difficult to do at first, but it's just a matter of standing your ground and not falling into habits or being pressured into them. You can still hang out; people get the idea after a little bit if you're confident in your choices. Just say no and don't argue it. (If it's an event, it can help if you bring your own stuff to drink.) Also, you have to get home, while they already are, which is another good reason.\n2. Alternate your drinks. You can have an alcoholic drink, then a non-alcoholic one, then an alcoholic one, etc. This can, unfortunately, open you up to a little bit of pressure because you're not matching \"pace\", but it's still doable. Just be aware that as they outpace you, the pressure will probably get worse.\n3. You can be a (lovable) dick about it. If they pressure you to finish a drink, you can finish it....by pouring it out.

(Curating this list to add pictures sucks, though.) I haven't been as consistent with this as I should be, but I do make progress. I've studied for about a month and I've learned around 150 characters through Anki (and more through general learning).\n- I'm also studying the 214 radicals, also through Anki, at about 6 new per day (mostly for writing and stroke order purposes, partly for recognition). I'm about halfway through them and I'm starting to burn out - I didn't create the cards well, and I think I'm going to change my approach for this deck. However, I've already seen the benefits and I want to learn all of them.\n- I fluctuate on grammar points - I don't have a set plan to learn them. (This should change.) I found a great resource last week that goes through individual grammar points and I've been trying to review a few things every day. I also get some basic grammar through HelloChinese and ChineseSkill, along with basic vocab.)\n- I listen all the time. I'm constantly watching Happy Chinese or Peppa Pig in Chinese, and I'm now watching Chinese dubs of shows I've seen just for variety (like Vultron). I also have access to native speakers, which is great. This is the thing I probably do the most - when I don't feel like studying, I listen. I don't have an hour estimate.\n- I bought a graded reader and I've been going through it. It hasn't been a daily thing, though. However, I also exercise my reading skills in Chinese by talking with natives through Discord and WeChat.\n- Speaking is an area that I'd like to start focusing on again. I wanted to speak early on, only to realize that I didn't have anything that I could really say in a conversation. So I started practicing with an Anki deck called Spoonfed Chinese, which can be good for shadowing practice. (I also get a bit of speaking through HelloChinese and ChineseSkill, but it's not really the same at all.) Also, after the holiday break, I'm hoping that I can start speaking practice with one of my coworkers (natives).\n- I review more than I learn new things, actually. Anki reviews are starting to kick my ass a little bit, and when I use ChineseSkill or HelloChinese, the first thing I do is review. I think this is important - what's the point of learning everything if you just forget it? (I never understood people who rush through a tree and don't review.) One issue that I have is that I don't review everything I've learned - if it's outside of Anki or one of the apps I use, it doesn't necessarily get reviewed unless/until it comes up in another context. (I do, however, review grammar points.)\n- I have been studying every day. I don't always get to do everything that I think that I should do every day, though. Today, I wanted to review radicals and just didn't have the mental energy to do it. I also missed my character review. However, I have read a chapter in my graded reader, I did a lot of listening in Chinese, I've had a text conversation on Discord and a little bit on WeChat today, and I made a voice recording in Mandarin for native speakers to critique. (Got a good review and some good feedback for improvement! I feel good about that.) So while everything doesn't get done, I do study every day and try to make progress in different areas.\n\nIs it working? That's the million-dollar question. It's definitely working, but some things are draining (Anki) and sometimes I feel as though my progress isn't as fast as it should be. I know that I'm going to alter my Anki decks (administering Anki decks is a pain the ass, though, it's the slowest part of any learning path) and I've made a plan with a friend in China to practice improving pronunciation through voice messages. I'm definitely learning a lot, but as I learn, I realize how much I'm missing and how much farther I have to do.

It's not difficult to pick up on a basic level, but I think that it's only saving grace is probably its lack of gendered nouns. Basically, after a certain point (and even in the beginning), nothing is really intuitive. Verb tenses seem easy to us natives but they're not intuitive for learners (and even some natives mess this up, to be honest). Spelling and orthography is a trash fire fueled by the blunders of history. English words and the rules governing their usage are slaves to their etymology, so everything is slightly different. Grammar seems intuitive to us natives, but its malleability actually can make it more difficult to learn. (Conjugation is simpler than the Romance language family, yes.) Pronunciation actually may be it's strongest point, as it's easy to ~~pick up~~ **approximate** (although you still have to get past our shitty orthography) but our system of inflection may not be intuitive at all depending on the language you come from.\n\nThe best thing about English is probably its ability to assimilate new words with little issue. This is possible because words generally tend to lose information as they enter into English vocabulary - we'll drop case (latin words), gender, and any pronunciation particulars that don't fit our language (Spanish words, pronunciations of names in Mandarin). Words can be turned into verbs without any prefixes or suffixes.\n\nHowever, since other languages also assimilate words easily in their own way, I honestly think that the only saving grace for English is its lack of grammatical gender.

Real people aren't subtitled, so you can't cheat.)\n\nAnother thing that I think is worth noting is this - when practicing listening comprehension, you can't be afraid to miss stuff. It can and will happen. You'll miss a word or a phrase or something. Instead of rewinding or pausing, just keep going. Real life doesn't allow you to rewind audio, so it's not a great habit to get into when specifically practicing for listening comprehension unless you have a specific goal in mind (trying to analyze a phrase, trying to hear a very quiet syllable, trying to identify a known or unknown word, or trying to mimic a native speaker's speech patterns, or something similar). I feel that it's better to simply keep going; if you care about the content, you can always rewatch it later, and you can also practice understanding through context (which is a big part of communication). I barely understood the first episode of that Venezuelan show, but after 35 episodes or so (one a day, alongside the Dominican Youtuber, and conversations with a friend in Mexico - lots of hours of just listening) I was very comfortable, and rewatching the first episode showed me just how much I'd improved.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I think you're spot on about everything.

It takes time and effort and can be frustrating, but it works. Learning to walk (listening to artificial speech) before deciding to learn to run isn't so helpful when it comes to listening comprehension; you'll end up having to learn to run again anyway (\"omg they talk so fast\"), and you'll face the same pitfalls.

Many of the comments here are talking about CEFR levels - I wouldn't focus on that for this time.\n\nI think that if I were in your situation - knowing what I know now - I would find Youtube videos that focus on the very basics of each language, and attempt to really focus on specific phrases and sentence constructions for travelling/getting around. You could also shadow speakers to improve your pronunciation (which will help a lot when travelling). I think that something like this would be very achievable within your timeframe for two languages. I wouldn't focus on reading or writing at all really, just speaking. (I also wouldn't necessarily focus on grammar - for your purposes and your timeframe, I think it'd be better to learn it through learning phrases and mimicking the patterns.) Using a resource like Tandem, you could even find people to roleplay scenarios with for travel purposes.\n\nIn addition to that, I would try to get as much passive listening practice as I could. This can be difficult without a vocabulary base in the language, but the other (more important) half of speaking a language is understanding it. In my personal opinion, there's almost no point in learning to speak a language for travel purposes if you can't understand any spoken responses. With that in mind, I would try to get as much listening practice as I can - again using Youtube. The good thing about this is that you can do it outside of your general learning time; if you're watching TV or listening to the radio, do it in your target language. If you're cooking or commuting or something, put something on in the background that's in your target language. You might be able to scope this to the types of interactions you'll be having when you travel. I say this primarily because a tool like Duolingo is completely different than a native speaker, and if you aren't prepared for that you won't stand a chance.\n\nSo, with all of that said - I think that if you focused on something like two useful phrases per day (and their possible responses) and you reviewed older phrases by placing them into a conversational practice narrative, you could achieve a lot in those two languages (partly since you already have a small foundation with what you've learned in Duolingo). I think I would focus on one language for 75 days, and then switch to the other for the remaining time (while still doing passive listening and phrase maintenance in the original language - passive listening every day, phrase maintenance maybe every three days or something?). You may or may not hit A2, but I honestly wouldn't worry about the CEFR levels in this case - they aren't relevant to your travel goals.", "created_utc": "1609361439.0", "edited": "1609398569.0", "id": "ghjabnc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kn7dv1", "parent_id": "t3_kn7dv1", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Hey, man. I saw this in my feed.\n\nI was in your boat about a year and a half ago. I stopped drinking, and except for the rare toast with friends or family, I no longer drink alcohol. I'd gone through times where I'd resolved not to drink for a month starting January 1st, etc, and it never really stuck. What finally did it for me was finding the reasons that I drank (and the triggers, and the situations) and finding the reasons that I no longer wanted to do so. (I ended up writing a [post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bi192z/giving_it_up/), which I'll freely share.)\n\nIn my experience, trying not to drink without analyzing the deeper reasons for the behavior didn't lead to good results, and I always fell back into bad habits. It was only until I could articulate what my core issues were with drinking and my core reasons for relying upon it that I could move forward. Since that time, I haven't had to \"stick\" to not drinking - it's just not a part of my life anymore because I identified the triggers and emotions associated with my use of alcohol. (I realized that I had desires that weren't related to drinking that I tried to realize through drinking - escaping anxiety, feeling good, feeling comfortable in social situations, etc.) It can be uncomfortable, and it's strange not having that emotional crutch for a while, but I feel that it's been worth it.\n\nHope this helps. You can do it. But in my personal experience, stopping a bad habit works better when your reasons and motives are intrinsic rather than extrinsic.

I think that going through the beginner portion of the new HSK list in Anki will take about a year.

Learn the strokes.\n\nIf you're studying characters already, use a resource that gives you stroke animations. Pleco has this, as does YellowBridge. (Both of these seem to use the library HanziWriter, which is a Javascript package that you can use on your own; I use it in my Anki decks.) Instead of looking at the character, just always have it play the animation. You'll internalize it without realizing, especially if you mimic the stroke order with a finger or something.\n\nIt gets easier as you go along, when you start to see stroke reuse and you begin learning radicals. [With a character like this](https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/character-stroke-order.php?word=%E5%96%9C), instead of memorizing 12 strokes, you'll be able to \"chunk\" them by component. (For instance, this character seems to have four components; the \"mouth\" radical accounts for two of them. )\n\nEssentially, it gets easier with time. There is a logical system behind everything - it's just difficult to see it at first until you actively start to practice it.\n\nAlso note that my examples refer to simplified script, which isn't necessarily easier to read, but is quicker to write and possibly easier to learn initially. (The rules for chunking and components also apply to traditional script, if not more so, so after the initial learning curve I would think it'd be similar except for the number of strokes and components involved.)\n\nTL;DR: If you're going to learn the characters, learn the stroke order.

You can also say \"it allows you to keep up with the story **without getting** lost.\n3. \"On the contrary\" always uses \"the\", but it's used to create a contrast with a previous statement, or to strengthen a contrasting statement. (Example: \"The cat is not alive; on the contrary, it's dead.\" \"We can go out today. On the contrary, we can stay in.\") In this case, it's not appropriate to use that phrase here.\n4. In general, with a noun (some object), you would say \"I recommend [noun]\", like \"I recommend this book\" or \"I recommend surgery\". To recommend something to a target, you would say \"I recommend this book for you\" (or \"to you\"). When recommending an action, we do say \"I recommend (that) you [verb]\", like \"I recommend that you go to the store\" or \"I recommend you read this book\".\n\nHope this helps.

This is okay...but the sentence that starts with \"for example\" feels a little disconnected.

This is okay...but it flows better this way:\n\n  > Or, it could be a young talented person, like this singer I found today who has an amazing voice, Ang\u00e8le.\n\n3. This sentence is good but it's a little weird, and the reason is because of the way you've created a list of ideas. The reason that it's odd is because of the use of commas for grouping. There are two ways to change this in this case, and I'll try to explain both. The first:\n\n  > I loved her voice, her lyrics, **and her beauty/looks/image**, and I'm genuinely glad that she's being acclaimed.\n\n  This uses this construction: \"I loved ... [list of items: item 1, item 2, and item 3] , and ... [final statement]. When we create lists of items in speech, it's best to try to keep the grammar as similar as possible. In this case, it's \"her X, her Y, and her Z\", instead of \"her X, her Y, she's Z\". (We try to do the same thing with verbs and their tenses in lists; for example, we say \"I like to run, swim, and dance\", but it's not as fluid to say \"I like to run, swim, and dancing.\")\n\n  This works because the grouping makes sense with the commas. (This is hard to me to explain as a native speaker, so just let me know if you have questions.)\n\n  The second:\n\n  > I loved her voice and her lyrics, she's so pretty, and I'm genuinely glad that she's being acclaimed.\n\n  This is just a collection of phrases, one after the other, separated by commas. The first phrase is a list of two ideas (her voice and her lyrics) and so doesn't need a comma. This means that the commas only end up grouping the phrases, not the list.\n\n4. \"Queen Elizabeth\" is a name and a title, so it doesn't receive an article in English. You can say \"the Queen\", but you can't say \"the Queen Elizabeth\" like you can in Spanish. This applies to other things, like \"President Abraham Lincoln\" and \"King George\". You can say \"The President\" or \"The King\", but as a title, you wouldn't use the article.\n\nHope this helps.

For this, the verb has to go in the infinitive, and the tenses of both subphrases have to match.)\n\n  In this case, then you can use \"it's going to take a while\" at the end, as a separate clause after a period or a comma.\n2.

You can have \"balance among\" many things, but only if it's a group of objects or ideas, like \"there is balance among the forces of the universe\". However, if you have one thing, like \"a conflict\", \"balance among a conflict\" sounds strange because \"conflict\" is a single thing. It's better, then, to say \"balance in a conflict\". Hope this makes sense.\n2. The possessive apostrophe (...'s) does not apply to possessive pronouns. (Mine, yours, (his, hers, its), ours, yours, theirs.)\n\n- Unless \"Chancellor Proposal\" is a title, this would actually be \"How do we react to the chancellor's proposal?\" (The proposal of the chancellor, the one that he or she made.)\n\nHope this helps!

It's the opposite in English than in Spanish (which is why I get it wrong in Spanish almost every time).\n2. This is actually okay. \"He had only gotten\" is a completely valid grammatical structure, but there is a slight subtlety to the meaning. (\"He had gotten\" would mean that he had already achieved something that can have a beginning and an end. However, you could also say \"he had only had\", which has the same tense but it's an action that doesn't have a beginning and an end - \"have\" vs \"get\". I think this is grammatically called the \"aspect\" of the verb, and it exists in both Spanish and English, but I don't know much about it.)

I found a Spanish exchange partner, and made friends.

It's also motivated me to actively review old material and learn new things I didn't know.\n\nIf you're like me, you're playing the long game. Here are some of the things I try to do pretty much daily:\n\n- Write in Spanish. I text my friends through Whatsapp, yeah, but I also do long-form writing every day. This has definitely helped and I'm better than I ever was at writing in the language. (Not anywhere comparable to a native, but maybe after a year or so of daily writing and increasing the challenge, I could write a high-school or college essay with 1000+ words.)\n- Listen to something in Spanish. It can be a telenovela on Youtube, the news, or even just my friends talking. I just try to get some exposure. Some days are better than others.\n- Speak the language. Voice messages or even just talking to yourself in quarantine helps. The important thing here is to talk to a native or a group of natives - if you make mistakes, they will know and can help you. Don't practice one-on-one with other learners (especially i you share a language), it's just not worth it.\n- Conjugation study. I've been slacking on this hard, actually, which is shitty. But if you were anything like me in school, you memorized the conjugation rules but couldn't actually use them in real time in a conversation. Or you memorized that little song \"o, as, a, amos, a\u00eds, an\" and had to repeat it every time for every verb in every tense. If there's a way to not be fluent, that's it. Study conjugations.\n- Vocabulary/other information. Some of this is passive through conversation and other stuff, but other times I make it more active, using something like Conjuguemos to actively review vocabulary. (I have a lot of knowledge gaps.) I should do this more often and I unfortunately don't always - I've been slacking lately.\n\nBasically, if you're in it for the long game, just start again.

I don't know what to tell you.\n\nDepending on your goals, you can learn something and you can be better than you are now.\n\nNote that you may not have time for dedicated study, but there are probably passive ways to increase your exposure to the language. There are already posts in here about changing the language of your devices and such. I would say that you can try to introduce Spanish through your extracurriculars as well. So this includes things like this:\n\n- If you consume media for recreation, consume it in Spanish. TV, Netflix, radio, whatever. Switch now, and don't look back, and don't worry about not understanding stuff.\n- If you play games at all - use Spanish audio and subtitles. This isn't just videogames - if you like doing crosswords on your phone, get a \"crucigrama\" app. (I just did this today and it's ridiculously fun - the app I have would be cake for a native speaker, but it's teaching me new things.)\n- If you ever browse the internet, do it in Spanish. It'll be really difficult at first.\n\nIn terms of study time....I guess you'd want to focus on vocabulary, verbs, and grammar.\n\n- Duolingo is not a bad way to get introduced to the basics of the language, but it won't get you close to fluent. However, you could probably start to understand the basics of the language with little time, so I'd recommend it. You'll also gain very basic vocabulary.\n- After getting the basics of the language through Duolingo (you don't have to complete the whole tree) it'd be good to pick up a grammar textbook, or use an online resource like [this one, the Spanish Online Grammar book](https://www.bowdoin.edu/~eyepes/newgr/index.html).\n- There's a program called [\"Anki\"](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) that's basically a high-powered flash card app. You don't need to get deep into it unless you want to (it's a world of its own) but there's an Anki deck called [\"Ultimate Spanish Conjugation\"](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/638411848) that's really good for learning the patterns behind Spanish verbs. If you follow the schedule for ten months, you'll have a leg up. While you might not use this when you speak depending on your level of fluency, you'll understand it when you hear it, which is arguably more important.\n\nUnfortunately, these thing alone will eat 30 minutes per day. You simply need more time with the language. I think if you're traveling, the most important thing won't be speaking well, but understanding. (You can probably manage to get your point across with simple tenses, word, gesture, etc....but if you can't understand what people say, you're lost.) I think you need exposure to the spoken language. Given your time constraint it's probably best to pay for lessons where you can practice conversation, and do them three times per week or something.\n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt, but I hope this helps. Basically, my advice would be, use your dedicated time for vocab, grammar, and verb study. Then, try to supplement that with other more passive activities outside of your 30-minute block, mainly centered around listening and input. When you can, get conversation practice. My guess is that you're military and thus don't have much time if you're being posted somewhere.

If it's hard to find a topic to write a few paragraphs about, it must be incredibly complicated to find a topic to write a whole book about. I think the most complicated part is not writing per se^3, the challenge is to find an interesting and fresh topic to write about.

How do I write a pretty good plot twist?\n> \n> I don't hate writing. In English **it's** quite fun because using another language aside from your mother tongue is entertaining. I don't write in my mother tongue, Spanish, unless I need to. If a professor *asks* me to write something or I want to congratulate a friend for their birthday, I need to write.

This sentence is okay, but the construction is a little awkward. I think we would generally reverse the order here, and say \"After sixty-five days of writing at least a paragraph in English every single day, ...\". Usually, if there's a phrase that describes the verb (in this case, writing) it will come before a temporal marker like \"every day\", \"for ten years\", \"every other night\", and others like that. Examples:\n\n  > He ate at least five slices of pizza every afternoon. \n  > She called the library more than twelve times every day.\n\n  In some cases, you can use commas. For instance: \"He ate, every afternoon, at least five slices of pizza.\" Depending on the sentence, though, this can work well or be awkward.\n\n2. Same comment as #1 - this would be more natural as \"Now I value the work that writers do even more\".\n3. \"I think the most complicated part is not the writing, per se\" is okay, but I think this is a little more natural as \"I don't think the most complicated part is the writing, per se\".\n4. \"Bestseller\" is a common word and can be used as a single word without a hyphen.\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\nI feel as though I have the opposite problem. I can write about things that I find interesting, but there are some topics that are hard for me to write about even in English. A topic such as \"describe your family\" is difficult because I don't really have a large family, so there simply isn't much to say in any language.

It's a nostalgia that reminds me to keep working on my English.\nMaybe I'll stop feeling **nostalgic** as I continue to get older and older, because I'm going to get used to remembering things that happened a long time ago.

I hope that I will be able to understand something, otherwise, I will try to understand at least some words. Surely I am going to recognize more than a sentence in the **long term**^1.\n\nI have been recalling ~~to mind~~^2 the authors that I have read, and I chose Poe.

Annotations use superscript (^like this) and are referenced in the notes section.\n\n#### Corrections\n\nNo one would deny the benefits of practicing writing regularly in the target language. This statement is even more true for us, members of streak subreddits, given that our primary goal is to attempt to write on an everyday basis in order to enhance our writing. However, I\u2019m wondering whether there are some ways of writing~~,~~ which are more efficient than others in terms of building **a** solid writing foundation.\n\nLet\u2019s make an example. Take two individuals who **belong** to the community \u201cWriteStreak\u201d with rather similar **levels** ~~at~~ **in** writing in English. Suppose that both are motivated and disciplined **learners**, **and** therefore do write on a day-to-day basis. The difference between the two lies ~~on~~ **in** their approach ~~of~~ **to** writing in their target language. One of them writes spontaneously, following as much as possible the flow of ~~its~~ writing. Hence, the output of his work reflects his raw/own writing, with ~~his~~ **its** upsides and downsides^1. The second type of guy, though, while writing, **tends** to look **something** up ~~on~~ **in** a dictionary or **on the** Internet when facing interrogation^2 on something. One question emerges, who out of the two is more likely to gain writing skills over the long run? I don\u2019t have a straight answer.\n\nI\u2019m more like the second type of guy. I tend to use some additional resources in order to come up with meaningful and proper sentences. However, I found out that there are quite a few advantages of writing spontaneously. For example, every ~~words/structures sentence~~ **word/structure/sentence** that you are able to come up with naturally, ~~are~~ **is** stored ~~into~~ **in** your brain dealing with active vocabulary. ~~Therefore, you may carry these acquired words over others primordial are speaking, reading or listening.~~ *Therefore, you may carry these acquired words over to other essentials like speaking, reading, or listening.* In fact, we know that all of them are interconnected, so improvement in writing may positively impact your speaking.\n\nBy the way, I just want to point out that the whole text has been written without ~~never~~ **ever** looking up any words/idioms. I wanted to see my true writing for once.\n\n#### Notes\n1. In this sentence with \"upsides and downsides\", it's more natural to refer to the text instead of the person writing it - so, \"its upsides and downsides\". You could also use \"strengths and weaknesses\", which could be used naturally to refer to the writer of the text - so, \"his strengths and weaknesses\".\n2. \"Facing interrogation\" works in a very technical sense, but it usually means being questioned by a person. In this case, you can simply say \"faced with a question\", which is more accurate and more natural.\n\n  > The second type of guy, though, while writing, tends to look something up in a dictionary or on the Internet when faced with a question about something.\n\n#### Misc\n\nThis is an interesting topic. I used to be like you - I would always look things up when I needed them. However, I've come to realize that that method didn't really help me improve my writing skills (although sometimes it would help me improve my vocabulary). Now, I try to write spontaneously, using what I know. However, after I write, I will try to look for things I didn't know how to say, or rely on corrections from native speakers to improve my vocabulary and phrasing. This has helped me to internalize new words and phrases, but more importantly, it's helped me to be able to write without constantly needing an outside resource. I can now write faster and phrase my thoughts in the target language because I'm not trying to translate something I would say in English into my target language. It also has helped me to identify my writing weaknesses, and it has additionally allowed me to improve \"talking around\" a phrase that I don't know.\n\nGood topic, well written!

In Mexico brown people are discriminated **against**. Just **turn on** a T.V. in Mexico and you're going to have a hard time spotting a brown person having a main role or conducting a *program*. Brown people earn less money than white people for the same job; brown is not considered beautiful or pretty, there is **not**^1 a single commercial or **ad** of **diapers**^2 with a brown baby; the only roles brown actors get ~~is~~ **are** as poor people who serve white people. There are neighborhoods in which only white people are allowed to live ~~in~~^3, there are only-white^4 schools, and there are in general^5, lots of places where brown people **are** not welcome, like clubs or private businesses. Mexico is a racist country, period.\n> I've seen that in America **it's** hard to find black people saying things like \"there's **no**^1 such thing as discrimination\", or discriminating **against** other black people, or being Trump supporters. But in Mexico one is just as likely to be discriminated **against** by a brown person as it is to be discriminated **against** by a white person. We're ~~are~~ discriminated **against** by the whites, and we're discriminated **against** by our own people. This is crazy, as a brown person I have listened^5 **to** things like \"you're brown, you cannot dye your hair\" or \"if your skin tone were lighter, you would be prettier\" from another brown person. Just, wtf. I like my skin, I'm comfortable with my skin, I don't need to change. The main problem ~~respecting~~ **with respect to**^6  discrimination in Mexico is that brown people think white is better. How are we **supposed** to start a movement like Black Lives Matter **if** we don't feel comfortable in our own skin? How is that brown people think brown is not beautiful? Why do brown people prefer seeing white people on T.V. over people who look like them?\n> Just as **a** quick story to help you understand how crazy is all of this. I have a really pretty **female** friend who is brown, she's stunning and lots of men want to date her. One day we were talking about all her ~~pretendants~~ **suitors**, and she said she prefers white men, because white men are prettier and her mom likes it more when she dates white men. Her mother is also brown. I just can't imagine what would happen if one day a white man says to her that he's not dating her because she's brown. As stunning as she is. Would she realize that she has been a little bit racist? Would she change? Would she even care about a man rejecting her for her skin color?\n> \n> If you are a person of color and want to come to Mexico, my intention wasn't to discourage you. Mexicans have a fascination for foreigners. Mexican people *discriminate* **against** other *Mexican* people, but *Mexicans* do not discriminate ** against** foreigners, which is also crazy.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- \"Discriminate\" in English can be used in a few different ways - but when we talk about the subject of discrimination with people or social groups, we say \"discriminate in favor of\" (when the group receives positive recognition or benefits) or \"discriminate against\" (when the group receives negative recognition or hardships). Examples for the same situation:\n\n> \"People in Mexico discriminate in favor of people with lighter skin.\n\n> \"People in Mexico discriminate against people with darker skin.\n\n1. In these cases, you can either say \"there is no single commercial\" or \"there's no such thing as discrimination\", or you can say \"there is not a single commercial\" or \"there's not such a thing as discrimination\".\n2. \"Ad\" is the shortened form of \"advertisement\" - in English, we only spell it with one D. \"Add\" means \"addition\". Also, instead of \"ad of diapers\", it's more natural to say \"ad for diapers\" or even \"diaper ad\".\n3. The second \"in\" is only necessary if you don't use the first. Example:\n\n  > There are neighborhoods in which only white people are allowed to live.\n\n  > There are neighborhoods which only white people are allowed to live in.\n\n  You can't use \"in\" in both places at the same time here. There may be some cases where this can happen with certain phrasal verbs, but I think those wouldn't use the same preposition twice in a row, like \"There are neighborhoods in which only white people are allowed to hang around.\"\n4. \"only-white\" is okay, but we would generally say \"white-only\" (or \"boys-only\", or \"girls-only\", or whatever). \"only-white\" is not wrong, though.\n5. \"I have listened to\" is okay here, but generally in this type of sentence we would say \"I have heard\". However, we also do say \"I have had to listen to\", which has the sentiment of being more of an unwanted obligation. (For example, \"I have had to listen to this baby crying all day!\")\n6. In this case, we would say \"with respect to\" - we don't use \"respecting\" in this way. However, you can also use the word \"concerning\": \"The main problem concerning discrimination...\"\n- \"Pretendents\" isn't a word in English - the word for \"pretendientes\" is \"suitors\" in English.\n\n#### Misc\n\nI've heard this from other Mexicans as well, and yes, it's definitely weird. I also know that you guys have strong feelings about speech patterns somewhat related to this as well (naco vs fresa, and certain slang phrases are looked down upon). A friend of mine told me that recently, an actress won an award, and people didn't take her seriously or respect her because she was morena. I also think it's interesting, because I'm black and it's true that the Mexican friends I've made seem to see it as a bit of a novelty (not in a bad way).

The underlying idea behind it for me was to get accustomed to writing in English on a day-to-day basis. However, by dint of writing every single day ~~on~~ **about** adventures going on in my life, I uncovered some hidden benefits for **myself**. I figured out, firstly, how hard it could be sticking to a new habit. On **the** other hand^2, I found the process of putting your thoughts on a piece of paper very uplifting and stress-relieving, since it **helps you organize**^3 your thoughts. When you come back to your entries at a certain time in the future, you may feel the agreeable yet bittersweet feeling of nostalgia. It has considerably helped me to do a daily journal, even though sometimes **the** same subjects would ~~come over~~ **come up**^4 again and again.\n> \n> I consider this subreddit to be the perfect **substitute** to my abandoned daily journal with the **icing on the cake**^5 \u2013 the possibility to be corrected.\n\n#### Notes\n\n1. The phrasal verb \"finding out\" means \"become aware of\" and it can also mean \"getting information\" (essentially the same as \"becoming aware of\", but with intention). It usually goes with \"that\", when followed by a statement, or \"about\" when followed by a noun (although there are other uses). Some examples:\n\n  > \"He's finding out that it's not as easy as it seems.\" (He's becoming aware of it.)\n\n  > \"He's finding out what the tickets cost.\" (He's intentionally getting the information.)\n\n  > \"He's finding out about the concert.\" (He's becoming aware of the concert, or he's intentionally getting the information.)\n\n  In this case, you can either say \"finding this subreddit\" (meaning that you encountered it, or you were searching for it and the search was successful) or you could say \"finding out about this subreddit\" (meaning you became aware of it). \"Finding out this subreddit\" sounds a little strange.\n\n2. \"On the other hand\" is a set phrase and always uses the definite article \"the\".\n3. The past tense in this case works well if you talk about something you did. In this case, since you're using \"you\", it sounds like a hypothetical situation, so the present tense works better. You could phrase this two ways:\n\n  > I found the process of putting your thoughts on a piece of paper very uplifting and stress-relieving, since it **helps you organize** your thoughts.\n\n  > I found the process of putting your thoughts on a piece of paper very uplifting and stress-relieving, since it **helped me organize my** thoughts.\n\n  Both work well, but note that the \"it helped you organize your thoughts\" makes it sound like something that has already happened to the person reading the passage. It almost prompts the question, \"when did it help me?\"\"\n\n4. The phrasal verb \"come over\" has a lot of uses, but in this case, the correct term is \"come up\", which can mean \"surfaced\" in both the literal and figurative sense.\n\n5. The term that we use here is \"icing on the cake\", which is a set phrase. However, we do also use \"cherry on top\" which generally refers to ice cream.\n\n- Extra note - \"dint\" is an awesome word, but we generally don't use it outside of literature.\n\nHope this helps.

It's like it's normal to be rude when you're French. We are not like that! I hope people are not going to believe that **the French**^4 are that arrogant.

I think it's honestly natural to feel this way, a little bit - it's good to learn the language, but it's not ideal to try to force it into situations where it isn't needed. It just gets weird for both people involved, actually - it's honestly a little weird and unnecessary in those situations, and one of the main reasons for this is that it's a \"one-and-done\" situation. It can definitely be taken the wrong way.\n\nTo a certain extent, this also depends on your level of Spanish. If you're fluent and you can can put natives at ease when speaking the language (be honest here), then you can probably go in Spanish-first - but if you can't do this (and I'm not sure that many non-native, non-heritage speakers in the US can), then in the US I'd just default to English until I know the person better.\n\nMy advice - if you really want to use your Spanish, don't use it during errands. (There's a really good chance anyway that English will do the job better and faster for everyone involved.) Instead, I'd suggest finding a restaurant or something where you can go on a regular basis - essentially, find a place with native Spanish speakers where you can actually hang out (like a restaurant or a coffee shop) and just start going there on a regular basis. Once you've established yourself as a regular, you can use that relationship to start using your Spanish and practicing with them. Again, unless you can put a native at ease with your speech, I think you want to establish a rapport before you try going in with Spanish.\n\nThese are my thoughts.

Respectfully, I have some questions.\n\n> I'm quite confident that, if these were to be available, they would primarily be sold to heterosexual men.\n\nWhy is this? The original post states that they would be available, and it doesn't make any assumptions about demographics - they would be available uniformly. Both men and women use escort services. Both men and women use sex toys, and in the public consciousness (at least in Western society, in the US) associates them more with women than men. I'm not convinced that a technological convenience like this would end up targeted at a single demographic divided by sex, gender, orientation, or sexual preferences.\n\n> I'm concerned primarily with the effect they would have on the status of women in society. By no means am I suggesting that women would be competing with robots, but rather that the addition of a literal object which one could substitute for a female companion would almost certainly contribute to the objectification of real, human women.\n\nThis statement is based on your first premise. I think there might be greater objectification overall at the outset of such a measure. However, I also believe that within a bit of time the objectification wouldn't end up between genders but between humans and technology. I believe that people would begin making distinctions between \"real\" people and sex robots (again, assuming from the OP's post that sapience isn't an issue). I think society would evolve its own new rules and social mores related to sex, relationships, and the objectification of machine-based tools and the non-objectification of people. (This is a common theme in sci-fi and we're starting to live it now; Siri, Alexa, and Cortana have female voices, and this hasn't had an effect on the objectification of women in society. They are virtual assistants, but people naturally make a distinction between this technology and regular people.)\n\n> This objectification has real-world consequences for women even now, so I'm frightened to consider what would happen if something major of this sort were to so firmly reinforce that.\n\nYou're right that women do have to face real-world issues today, and I don't want to discount that. However, I disagree with your analysis of this hypothetical situation - it reads like an appeal to fear. I think you've based your opinion on the assumption that these tools would be used primarily by heterosexual men (as opposed to a somewhat equal distribution over time between different demographic groups), and based on the OP I'm not sure that we can make that assumption.\n\nGood post, though.", "created_utc": "1602785111.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g8x6j8z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_jbifos", "parent_id": "t1_g8vkqwy", "score": "4", "subreddit": "TrueAskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s91q"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "They can, depending on the context. \"However\" is kind of like \"but\" - it can express contrast between the first phrase and the second phrase. \"Nonetheless\" also expresses contrast, but it's closer to \"despite that\". It implies that the first phrase is related to the second; the second phrase happens even though the first phrase implies that it shouldn't. Some examples:\n\n- \"His family is incredibly rich. However, he can't buy an airplane.\" This expresses a contrast between \"his family is rich\" and \"he can't buy an airplane\", but there's not a direct relation between the clauses unless you explicitly state it.\n- \"His family is incredibly rich. Nonetheless, he can't buy an airplane.\" This expresses the same contrast between \"his family is rich\" and \"he can't buy an airplane\", but now there's a stronger relationship between the first phrase and the second phrase. Although his family is rich and he should be able to buy an airplane, he cannot.\n\nThe difference is subtle and in many cases these can be interchanged.

While he was walking, he **aimed towards** the fancy and elegant *neighborhood*. One of the houses, a **luxurious** and well-known one, was his objective. When he reached the house, he took a breath, and knocked **on** the door.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he^1 opened the door. He was a **bright** and healthy man, in ~~around~~^2 his twenties, wearing ~~a~~ good-quality **clothing** and ~~with~~ a smile ~~drawed~~ **on** his face. Even though Raskolnikof (and also known as Rodion) was not there ~~for contemplate~~ **to study**^3 him, he ~~stared~~ **spent** a little time watching him, trying to discover somehow what was hidden behind his kindly^4 smile.\n\nBut suddenly, the owner of the house said his name, why? It **didn't** matter, he was the kind of person who does rare things; like, for example, telling his name to strangers. Oh, an interesting fact, his name was Gatsby.\n\nGatsby and Raskolnikof were there, in the entrance, looking **at** each other, but, instead of starting a friendly conversation, Raskolnikof **pulled** up his axe and.... Well, the rest is history.\n\nWell, I finished the story abruptly because surely I have a lot of mistakes. The two characters are Gatsby (from the Great Gatsby of course) and Raskolnikof or also is called Rodion, or Rodia (from Crime and Punishment).\n\n#### Notes\n\n1. \"He\" is grammatically correct here, but there is ambiguity about whom you are speaking. The previous sentence dealt with Raskolnikov, so a better word to use here would be \"someone\" so that the reader knows that this person is not Raskolnikov.\n2. You can say \"in his twenties\" (meaning that he's between 20 and 29), or you can say \"around his twenties\" (which generally means that he's in his early twenties or so) but you can't really use both at the same time.\n3. \"Contemplate\" is a good word, but \"study\" is a little better here.\n4. \"Kindly\" generally isn't used anymore in modern American English as an adjective. However, because this context is literary, it works well. Just be aware that outside of this literary context, it might sound strange.\n- In general, when writing in a literary style like this, it's best to choose a verb tense and use that tense throughout the passages. Many books are written in the past tense. Your text was written in the past tense, so some corrections try to maintain that tense.\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\nI should reread The Great Gatsby - it's been a long time since I've read any Hemingway - and I really should finish Crime and Punishment.

We generally tend to use \"all along\" with something in the past tense, like \"I knew it all along\" or \"He had been motivated all along\", and not in the present or future.\n2. The phrasal verb \"come across\" in this context has to be used as \"you come across\"in this case, as \"come across\" in this sense means \"encounter\". The phrasal verb \"come along\", on the other hand, doesn't have to use \"you\", as in this case it would mean \"appear\". You \"encounter\" a problem, but a problem \"appears\" by itself. I hope that makes sense. Let me know if you have questions.\n3. This is okay, but it's a little weird. It's hard to explain, but I would rephrase this like so:\n\n  > one \u2014 someone whose life was not an easy road, having to deal with poverty or face some traumatic events at a young age for example \u2014 may...\n\n  - Because the descriptive sentence is complex and has more than one phrase, instead of commas, an em dash is used.\n  - \"Dealing\" and \"facing\" is changed to \"having to deal or face\" to place it in the context of the life in the past.\n\n4. We generally use \"a moment\" to mean a short period of time (for example, \"wait a moment\"), and I'm not sure whether this was intentional in this sentence or not. I'm also not sure if you wanted to use \"nonetheless\" or \"however\".\n5. This sentence works better with this parallel structure:\n\n  > Motivation is a handy tool that can not only...

There are times when I think I'm meditating because I'm not thinking, but I'm thinking \"omg I'm not thinking\" and I guess that counts as a thought. So, total failure. I'd love to be able to meditate because I firmly believe that it's a good activity for your mind. I think that people who meditate are generally more calm and self-aware. I'm not going to lie to you, the monks who live in mountains, drinking tea all day long and meditating for days straight non-stop, do look kind of fresh. I feel like these monks know what's life about, I don't know how but they managed to **figure** it out. Maybe I should become a monk, but I'm not really a good meditator and I think that's a requirement to become one.\n\n#### Notes\n\n1. \"Yoga mattress\" isn't grammatically incorrect, but we usually say \"yoga mat\". A mattress is the big thing that's on your bed that you sleep on, and a yoga mat is the small pad that you can roll up and put under your arm. (A yoga mattress does sound funny, though, I bet it'd be really comfortable.)\n2. \"Failed\" is okay here, but \"fail\" works better because the way you talked about your meditation before was also in the present tense, as well as the parts afterwards.

You can say \"enter into something\", or you can say \"enter something\", but \"enter to something\" is wrong.\n5. We use \"like if\" in colloquial speech a lot to continue sentences, but in writing it's better to use \"As though\" or \"As if\".\n6. This sentence is a little weird. It's hard to explain, but it has to do with the verb tenses. I would write it this way:\n\n  > As if I were trapped inside my body, wanting to run outside and smell the petrichor and feel the freshness that comes after the rain, but **staying because** it is too cold and dangerous outside.\n\n  This allows the verb tenses in the individual clauses to match.

My grandmother asked me one time ~~why~~ **how** I can wear something like this^4, well, it's because the skull looks happy and it's always laughing!\n\n#### Notes\n\n1. This can be phrased in two different ways, depending on what you want to say:\n\n  > I was already wondering why I had bought something that expensive that I didn't even need\n\n  > I was already wondering, \"why did I buy something that expensive that I didn't even need\"\n\n  Both are fine, but they can't be mixed.\n\n2. In this case, we use the term \"goth\" as the noun and the adjective for someone who is a part of the goth subculture. (I don't know why this is - I don't think it's a grammar thing, it's just the way we use the word.) Examples:\n\n  > \"I went to school with this goth girl.\"\n\n  > \"I'm not a goth, I just like to wear black clothes and think about death\"\n\n  > \"Joseph? Yes, he's the one wearing goth clothes.\"\"\n\n3. This can be expressed in three ways:\n\n  > I have worn it every single day since.\n\n  > I have worn it every single day.\n\n  > I wear it every single day.\n\n  When you use \"since\" to mean \"from that time until now\", you would usually use the present perfect verb tense (\"I have worn\"). However, if you use \"since\", you can't use the present tense (\"I wear\"). I hope this makes sense.\n\n4. In this case, it's either \"how I can wear\" or \"why I wear\". \n\n- Generally, in modern American English, our exclamation marks (!) and questions marks (?) don't have a space between the mark and the final word. I think there are older style guides that put a space between the punctuation and the word, but I don't think it's common anymore (at least not in English). Example:\n\n> it's always laughing! (modern standard)\n\n> it's always laughing ! (non-standard)\n\nHope this helps.", "created_utc": "1602476448.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g8k9ndv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j9gkq5", "parent_id": "t3_j9gkq5", "score": "1", "subreddit": "WriteStreakEN", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y42lo"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Again, agree to disagree, but I do think it's the worst in the franchise.

In this case, \"grade\" refers to the level, while \"class\" refers to the group of people.

Note that I'm a native speaker, not an English teacher, so this comes naturally for me and I've never really had to explain it.\n\n### On\n\nAs a location preposition, we use \"on\" when an object has a surface, and we use it to indicate that the subject is on the surface of the object, or that the subject rests \"on top of\" the object. Examples:\n\n> The plate is on the table. (The plate is on the surface of the table.)\n\n> The ant is on the ball. (The ant is on the surface of the ball.)\n\n> We are on the planet. (We are on the surface of the planet.)\n\n> The roof is on the house. (The roof rests on top of the house.)\n\n> The child is on my shoulders. (The child rests on top of my shoulders.)\n\nIt can also be used to indicate that something is hanging from something.\n\n> The shirt is on the hanger. (The shirt is hanging on the hanger.)\n\n> The monkey is on the branch. (The monkey is hanging from the branch.)\n\n### In\n\nIn the English language, \"in\" exists because we partition things - often by space, but sometimes by other criteria.\n\nAs a location preposition, we use \"in\" only when object can be partitioned into an \"inside\" space and an \"outside\" space. We use \"in\" to indicate that the subject is \"inside\" of the object.\n\n> The food is in the fridge. (The food is inside of the fridge.)\n\n> The money is in the case. (The money is inside of the case.)\n\nWe also use \"in\" when a subject is surrounded, or when a subject is between objects; we tend to think of the subject as being in the \"inside\" partition.\n\n> The cheese is in the sandwich. (Between the bread is the \"inside\" partition; the cheese is inside the sandwich because it is between the bread.)\n\n> The man is in the corner. (The corner represents a separate partition than the rest of the room. The man is inside of that partition.)\n\nWe also use \"in\" when we partition things using criteria other than space.\n\n> She is in the group. (The group represents a partition; she is inside of that partition.)\n\n### Notes\n\nThis is a big subject and I'm realizing as I write this that I don't even know how to approach it. We use \"in\" and \"on\" as location prepositions, but then we also use them for general partitioning, and I don't know the rules behind that. (For example, we say that someone is \"in\" a group, but we say that someone is \"on\" a team, and I have absolutely no idea why that is - I'd have to really think about it and analyze it.) We also have cases where modern concepts use \"in\" or \"on\" because of historical concepts - for instance, something is \"on Google\" because it's on the webpage, which has the connotation of a paper page. We say that a phone is \"on the hook\" because phones used to hang on hooks, even though they no longer do. It gets worse when we use these words with virtual objects or abstract concepts. (However, in many cases, the usage can be traced back to a physical concept.)\n\nI hope this helps a little bit but I'm realizing that it might actually cause more problems. I hope not.

However, questions in English generally have a subject. If the subject is unknown or general, you can use the impersonal \"you\", or you can use \"one\". Examples:\n\n  > How does one keep a good team spirit when the ones who have to work together hate each other before it even starts?\n\n  > How do you keep a good team spirit when the ones who have to work together hate each other before it even starts?\n\n2. The sentence works better as: \"My class and our juniors have a workshop to do together, all week long.\"\n3. \"In\" and \"on\" can be confusing. In this case, both are acceptable, although I would favor \"on\". Let me know if you have questions and I can try to explain \"in\" and \"on\" in more detail.\n4. In this case, the present perfect tense works better for descriptions like these, because they are related to the present moment. This would be:\n\n  > I **have** heard (I've heard) that this girl was not appreciated in her class as well because of her manner and it seems that she acts like a diva.

Alternatively, you can use \"the juniors\", which means \"the people in the junior class\". \"Our juniors\" isn't incorrect, but it's not common to say in English - at least not in the United States. I can't speak for other countries. With the sentence from #2, this would be:\n\n  > My class and the junior class have a workshop to do together, all week long. We, the seniors, started to plan what we have to do and we created a conversation on Messenger to guide the juniors on what they have to think about and to line some equipment up.\n\nHope this helps.", "created_utc": "1602315766.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g8aoyn2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j8bohv", "parent_id": "t3_j8bohv", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakEN", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y42lo"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "#### Corrections\n\n> The ~~perspective~~ **thought** of traveling overseas can provoke cold sweats for some people, often those who have never had the chance to go abroad. ~~Yet~~ **But**, once you\u2019ve ~~ever~~ experienced living in a foreign country, you may find yourself addicted, and the anxiety you had before the departure will eventually turn into ~~excitation~~ **excitement**.\n\nI told you all of this^1 because I went ~~in an~~ **to** Ireland a few months to do an internship.

The more natural phrase to use here is: \"I say this because...\". In English, this is almost a set phrase, and it goes in the present tense if you are referring to the preceding thing you just said.\n2. \"I have no fear telling you...\" can be used in the right context, but in this case it also sounds a little bit unnatural. The more natural phrase here would be \"I wouldn't hesitate to say that...\".\n3. In this case, the gerund is used because of the context of the phrase (the phrase requires a noun). A few examples:\n\n  > I resigned myself to the impossibility of meeting my friend.\n\n  > I resigned myself to the impossibility of going home.\n\n  > I resigned myself to the impossibility of change.\n\n4. \"Apprehend\" is a \"false friend\" between French and English. [\"Apprehend\" in English translates to \"arr\u00eater\" in French.](https://www.linguee.com/english-french/search?query=apprehend). Be careful with false friends! When in doubt, look up the word in Linguee - it's a good way to learn new vocabulary and avoid confusion. (I recognized this mistake because although I don't remember the exact word in French - I think it's \"apprend\" or something similar - the Spanish word is \"aprender\".)\n\n  Finally, \"learn\" works well here, but \"discover\" can also work well.\n\nI think your writing is generally good. I think that I can see that your word choice is informed by your French vocabulary, though, and not everything matches up between English and French (or really, English and all Romance languages; English tends to favor words with Germanic roots over words with Latin roots for a lot of everyday speech). This can be an area of improvement for you.

Sometimes I give her chicken, I just need to **crumble**^3 it really well. She used to like bones**. W**ell, I guess she still likes bones, she just can't eat them now.

Nicky is more mine than my family's, but the new dog will be more my brother's than mine or my family's^7.\n\n#### Notes\n\n1. \"A\" and \"an\" are like \"y\"and \"e\", or \"o\" and \"u\" in Spanish - they mean the same thing and they only exist to make the words flow better when spoken. They're just as important as their Spanish counterparts. If \"a\" comes before a word that begins with a vowel sound when spoken out loud - like \"apple\", \"elf\", \"icicle\", \"octopus\", or \"uvula\", it converts to \"an\". If the word begins with a consonant sound, like \"cat\", \"dog\", \"pig\", or \"uniform\" (and of course many others) then it will stay as \"a\".\n2. \"it's a female\" can work, but it might be better to say \"she's a female\".\n3. \"Crumble\" is a great word, but it's a little weird here. The word \"crumble\" generally only applies to hard, dry things breaking into many small pieces. Since meat generally isn't a hard substance, a better word here might be \"crush\" or \"mash\". A generic phrase that would work in many cases would be the phrasal verb \"break apart\".\n\n  > Sometimes I give her chicken, I just need to break it apart really well.\n4. Here, you can also say \"Also, her sight is not the best anymore\".\n5. \"No troubles walking\" is okay, but it's more natural to use \"trouble\" in the singular in this case - \"no trouble walking\".\n6. \"Them\" is okay here, but I think it's more natural in this case to use \"it\". \"Them\" is generally the third-person plural; it can be used in the singular form when the gender of of something is unknown, but it usually is a little better to use the third-person singular \"it\". (This only applied to animals - not to people.)\n7. It's difficult to explain, but I word reword this entire sentence:\n\n  > Nicky belongs mostly to me, but the new dog will belong to my brother, not to me or my family.\n- Generally, \"nor\" is only used after \"neither\" - for example, \"it's neither this nor that\". But with the word \"not\", it's generally \"it's not this or that\".\n\nHope this helps.", "created_utc": "1602311493.0", "edited": "1602311682.0", "id": "g8akv07", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j832v5", "parent_id": "t3_j832v5", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakEN", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y42lo"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "The original poster may not be a native English speaker.

When we  use a specific temporal marker in the past like \"two weeks ago\", \"yesterday\", \"last year\", we don't use the present perfect tense (\"I have written\"); instead, we use the simple preterite \"I wrote\". The present perfect maintains the temporal relationship to the present moment. So you can say \"In my life, I have written...\" or \"in the past year\" or \"in the past few days\", as long as the time you're referring to is from the beginning to now. I hope that makes sense.\n\n  Additionally, while \"wrote on\" can work in some cases, I can't think of any situations where \"write about\" doesn't work better.\n- ^#2 Hard to explain, but I think that this construction for these two sentences works better and conveys in English what I think you want to say. Let me know if you have questions.\n- ^#3 I don't speak French, but I would guess that you mean other countries neighboring France. You could say \"region\" for this, but you can also say \"neighbors\". (Also, you may already know this, but there is a traditional British spelling for \"neighbour\" and the American spelling \"neighbor\". Both are acceptable.\n- ^#4 \"Being\" in English is more of a passive verb. We also tend to use the set phrase \"traveling abroad\". Finally, you can say \"when traveling abroad\", but in this case \"while traveling abroad\" is a little more natural.\n- ^#5 \"Moderately\" works here but is a little awkward. I understand what you wanted to say, though. \"In moderation\" is a set phrase that works a little better here.\n- ^#6 You can either say \"conservative mentality\" (adjective + noun) or you can say \"conservatism\" (noun).\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\nI've never been to France and I don't speak French (unfortunately, maybe one day I should learn) but in the United States we have a lot of the same problems you do, but with French and Spanish. There's an emphasis on grammar, but not always an emphasis on speaking, and if we do speak it's not in real situations. So yeah, I understand where you're coming from. You're doing great! I know how it feels to be demotivated about your progress (I feel the same with my Spanish, often) but I think the important thing is just to continue improving, little by little.\n\nHope this helps.

Let's talk about canceling science first.\n> \n> In the past years^1, we've seen a growth in ~~the~~ scientific denialism. Many people don't believe in science**;** therefore they make a lot of bad decisions, like not taking their children to get vaccines and denying global warming, while they claim that scientists are just some crazy guys who want to control our lives. Most of those scientific deniers are religious and use their ~~believing~~ **beliefs** to explain nature and to make decisions in life. We have to be careful when that happens, since those people can lead a huge denialism movement and provoke a lot of impacts in our society^2, **especially** when they constitute our governments. I don't have to say more about it since we can watch this happening now with the coronavirus pandemic.\n> \n> On the other hand, ~~there's~~ **there are** also a lot of attempts of canceling religion. I know this isn't a movement as big as denialism but it happens. Many people say that religions are useless and those who are religious are just manipulated sheep. But we have to take into account that a lot of people find meaning in their lives with **religion**^3. Sometimes, **religion is**^3 good for people to overcome a bad situation, for example. So, we can't cancel it. We have to assure that everyone has their right to choose a religion or not to follow one.\n> \n> With that said, I can reassert my point.

For example: \"In the past few years\", \"In the past ten years\", \"In the past year\", \"In the past six months\". \"In the past years\" feels incomplete. (However, you can say \"in past years\", which is more general and less of a temporal marker.)\n- ^#2 \"Provoke a lot of impacts in our society\" sounds a little weird. We might say \"have a lot of impacts in our society\" or \"provoke a lot of changes in our society\" or something similar. Without knowing more about what you want to say, it's hard to make a suggestion to reword this.\n- ^#3 \"Religions\" in plural generally is used to refer to individual religions of the world, while \"religion\" in the singular refers to the concept as a whole. In this context, I think the singular (signifying the overall concept) flows more naturally.\n- ^#4 In English, we avoid double negatives.

I'll cross out phrases where there's a big difference, and I'll use superscript annotations for footnotes.\n\n#### Corrections\n\n> I can't see why not. People can be active members of their **religious** groups and still be people of science. I think the problem is when very scientific people and very **religious** people deny each other. Most people of science don't think **religious** people are wrong or that they should stop being **religious**, but there are really extreme people who deny and invalidate other's beliefs. You have the right to not believe in anything, but you don't have the right to mess with **religious** people. These people were raised **differently** and have a different lifestyle**;** it is not okay to tell them that their lifestyle is wrong and you're right just because science is on your side. Religiousness^1 and spirituality have nothing to do with facts and hard data, **it's** about feeling good and interpreting life as you like. On the other side, you have the right to be part of the religion you want, you have the right to participate in the rituals and festivities of that religion, and you have the right to live as a religious person without ever **being** ~~molested~~ **bothered** because of your beliefs. But you don't have the right to force others into your religion, to say that your beliefs are the right ones, and to ~~molest~~ **bother** others because of their beliefs, or in this case, because of their lack of beliefs. Both science and religion have been really good for people, and also really bad. We've got vaccines, computers**,** and rockets, but we also had atomic bombs^4. We got a feeling of belonging and culture because of religion, but we also had discrimination^4. We just need to *learn* to coexist **on**^3 this **extremely** diverse planet.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- ^#1 \"Religiousness\" and \"religiosity\" are both words, and they're both synonyms, but honestly they both sound weird. In this case, I would just use the noun, \"religion\". So this would be: \"Religion and spirituality have nothing to do with facts and hard data...\"\n- ^#2 The word you want is \"bother\" - \"molest\" is a false friend between English and Spanish. \"No me molestes\" translates to \"don't bother me\". This is a pretty common error. (Edit: To clarify, the verb \"to molest\" in English is \"violar\" in Spanish.)\n- ^#3 \"In\" vs \"on\" - this is also another common error for Spanish speakers coming to English, since they are both covered by \"en\". In this case, we're \"on\" the planet because we're on the surface of it. Being \"in\" the planet would be like being \"inside of\" the planet - dentro de ella. There may be some exceptions to this rule, but when we talk about physical location, if something has an inside and an outside and the object is inside of it, we use \"in\".  If the object is merely on the surface of something, the it's \"on\" it. (We also tend to use \"in\" if the object is surrounded, or between things. Let me know and I can provide examples, if you want.)\n- ^#4 These sentences are okay, but they can also be written like so:\n\n  > **We've gotten** vaccines, computers, and rockets, but we **have also had** atomic bombs. **We've gotten** a feeling of belonging and culture because of religion, but **we've also had** discrimination.\n\n  This construction uses the present perfect tense, which (like Spanish) maintains the past relationship with the present moment. It also works well because the previous sentence used the same tense, so the three phrases together work well in a temporal sense in telling the story.\n\nHope this helps.", "created_utc": "1601958110.0", "edited": "1601959714.0", "id": "g7v6rj8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j5qfrq", "parent_id": "t3_j5qfrq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "WriteStreakEN", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y42lo"}, {"author": "lunchmeat317", "body": "Yeah, but someone still would have to design that, and as an engineer that shit sucks.

A language like Mandarin has a neutral third-person pronoun (and as a result some native Chinese speakers mess this up in English as well).\n\nAs I learn more about Spanish and some other languages, I understand why English is regarded as so simple in some ways.

Prepare yourself.\n\nI think that translation apps are useful tools, but you have to be mindful of how you use them. If you're reading a passage, it's good to try to guess the word via context clues, and try to see if you can figure it out from other uses of the word. After finishing the entire passage (this might be an article, or a chapter in a book, or something), then it's good to try to keep an idea of what you think the word is, then check to see what it really is. (For this, if your language skills are more advanced, it can be better to consult a dictionary in the target language; otherwise, a translation tool can also help.)\n\nSo in short, I think it's good to:\n\n- Try to determine an unknown word from context. (Is it a verb? If so, what's the person, tense, and mood? Is it a noun? How is it used? Is it part of a phrase?)\n- Read the rest of the passage without looking up the word, then look it up later.\n- Prefer a dictionary than a direct translation, unless you're using a translator like Linguee that will give multiple translation options when relevant along with usage examples.\n- Once you know the word, actively try to recall its meaning when you see it (if you can't remember, resort to translation, but at least try first).\n\nI don't think it's good to:\n\n- Come across an unknown word and just translate it without trying to learn it\n- Come across an unknown word and stop reading because you don't understand the single word\n- Translate a single word in isolation from the phrase (idioms will mess you up)\n\nEssentially, the problem isn't the tool; it's how you use it.

I don't know my level of Spanish - I think I'm B1, maybe B2.\n\nThere are a lot of things that routinely trip me up and I feel as though the farther I go with Spanish learning, the less I know/the more I realize I don't know/the more I have to learn. It can be frustrating. I think that the hardest things are:\n\n- The pronunciation. Pure vowels, the RR, and even simple consonants like J and D are things that I can't get right. I also tend to trip over words as I'm trying to pronounce them. I'm just not used to the phonology and am firmly stuck in Gringo land.\n- Thinking while speaking. When I learned Spanish in high school I rarely spoke the language and it's been a problem for me ever since. I'm the guy who mismatches genders and tenses and moods when speaking (or I just straight-up forget shit) just because I can't seem to say what I want to say in the moment. (When I write, this doesn't happen, as I have time to consider what I want to say.)\n- Listening comprehension. It's much better now than it ever has been, but most dialects of Spanish have a cadence that's pretty unfamiliar to English ears. I believe that it's due to the syllable timing of the languages versus the stress-timed nature of English. As my listening improves I realize that a lot of Spanish isn't really fast, but there are times when there are a lot of syllables that fly by without any change in the rhythm. (All Spanish is like this, but Dominican Spanish is a good example.)\n- The subjunctive. Often, we're just taught the rules for usage, but it's really hard for us to really understand and internalize the sentiment of the subjunctive. Sometimes, Spanish natives simply can't help with this, as it's a mood and mindset that doesn't exist in English. I've been trying to understand and internalize the sentiment myself. (Essentially, I think we can follow the rules, but we don't really understand *why* a phrase like \"a prop\u00f3sito, solo para que lo sabes\" doesn't make sense to a native Spanish speaker, and how \"sabes\" and \"sepas\" are so different to a native. This is a goal of mine and it's difficult.) Following the rules isn't hard to do, but I feel like internalizing and understanding the mindset and the core difference between the feel of the indicative and subjunctive is something else entirely.\n- Preterite imperfect vs preterite perfect. For a long while, I thought I really got this, and I've only recently realized that I don't - I was watching a show and a character used the perfect preterite in a sentence that I thought would use the imperfect, and that's when I had my \"awww, maaaan...\" moment. I know there are times I get it right, but if I don't know when and how I get it wrong, there's a problem.\n- Gender. It's not a difficult concept at all, but native speakers simply don't make gender mistakes, and I do. I don't know if I'll ever reach a level where gender and number agreement will be second nature and I'll never fuck it up.\n- Prepositions. Haven't memorized all the use cases in conjunction with different verbs.\n\nIssues that I used to have when I learned in high school included reflexive/pronominal verbs, the placement of direct and indirect object pronouns when reading (different reading order than English), and \"lo que\" and stuff like that. I think this stuff is better now.

Start speaking as soon as possible. I'm one of those people who can write fairly well (if it's not a bad day), and I can read Spanish (at least, the words I know) and with continued practice I'm much better at understanding spoken Spanish of different dialect....but my speaking is an atrocity and I am quite honestly ashamed. I studied Spanish back in high school, at the turn of the century (how old does that make me sound?) and my speech skills should be much better than they are now. Don't be me. Speak early and learn to express your thoughts, even simple ones, in Spanish.\n2. Get access to native speakers as soon as you can. Make a friend who is trying to learn English, or something. Watch native media and when you're ready, talk to natives instead of talking to other people learning the language. This sounds harsh, but if you end up going to a Meetup group or something filled with only other learners or non-native speakers, it won't be as instructive as speaking with native speakers. (This will also really help your pronunciation from day one and avoid you falling into bad habits.) Making a friend is the best because it really motivates you to learn the language.\n3. Once you get to a certain level (possibly earlier than one might think) start trying to learn the language using the language itself. A good example of this is a series called Espa\u00f1ol en Episodios, which you can find on Youtube; it's a high beginner/low intermediate Spanish course disguised as a telenovela, and it's all in Spanish. I honestly wish I'd had this series when I was in high school; it really would have helped me a lot if I'd been the type of student to apply myself.\n4. Apply yourself. Practice every day, even if it's something small. Consistency and effort is the key.\n5. Conjugations suck but they have to be learned. If you use Anki, [a deck like this might help you to familiarize yourself with all of the conjugation forms.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ijexgd/deck_ultimate_spanish_conjugation/). Don't be me, the person hunting for the right conjugation amidst \"uhhs\" and \"ummms\" for that one irregular verb type. Don't be me, the student memorizing that little song - \"o, as, a, amos, \u00e1is, an\" - and having to run through the whole thing every time for the third-person present plural. Don't be me, the student who didn't put any emphasis on learning the subjunctive conjugations and instead relied on the construction rules, thinking that's all I needed to know.\n\nEssentially, don't be me and you'll probably do well.

We **prepare**^1 ourselves weeks before the test, maybe even months, and we study every single day at least a little bit. Taking a break feels like wasting precious time and after taking **a** break I feel guilty. This is so much stress for just a few minutes of solving a test^2. After all, the worst case scenario that can happen is not passing the test, it is not the end of the world, is it?^3 But no matter how many tests I've taken or how much I tell myself that *it is* nonsense stressing out just for a test, I keep stressing out. I hope one day to have the calmness to just have as many tests as life wants to throw at me and remain **relaxed**.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- ^#1 \"prepared\" is good, but it sounds a little like something that's already happened. Keeping it in the present tense makes it sound more like a hypothetical situation, in this case.\n- ^#2 This is good, but \"solving a test\" sounds a little weird to me. We usually say \"solving a problem\" or \"solving a puzzle\", but I would use \"taking a test\", \"taking an exam\", or even \"answering questions\" or something like that. What you said isn't bad, but it's a little unnatural (but not unintelligible) because we don't usually say \"solving a test\".\n- ^#3 Generally, if there are two phrases in a sentence, and the last phrase is a question, those two phrases should be separate sentences separated by a period, or they can be one sentence separated by a comma. So this sentence:\n\n  > After all, the worst case scenario that can happen is not passing the test, it is not the end of the world, is it?\n\n  ...we have these two phrases, where the first is a statement and the second is a question:\n\n  - After all, the worst case scenario that can happen is not passing the test\n  - it is not the end of the world, is it?\n\n  Because the question is its own phrase, it's better if they have a \"stronger\" split in the sentence than a comma can provide.
