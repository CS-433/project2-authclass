So since we're on the same page about not really wanting to harm them, I believe in finding natural ways to repel them.

So far, I haven't seen any that used to populate the window sill where I set it. (I might get one for the window in my room). Peppermint oil also really does the trick in most instances. I have definitely reapply my barriers for the summer months, but for you, the only places you have to worry about are any windows, doors, vents, and any other tiny crack that you might able to see them getting through. Plus, it makes everything smell nice. If you can, try also plugging up those cracks.\n\nCleaning is also really important. Vacuuming makes a huge difference and not having laundry piles for them to hide around is essential. Any slight sign of mold, I deal with it using bleach or mold/mildew remover (I think that I've discovered that they don't like the smell of bleach much either).

I normally choose one or two recipes (I cook every four days), then I go out and get everything. This initial trip for me normally costs around $100-$200 USD. But the trick is that after that, the ingredients that I cooked with before are in supplemental recipes that I use later (things like oil, milk, spices, cheeses, flour, sugar, pasta, rice, etc.). These are called pantry staples and are used in a majority of recipes. So for the next few weeks, I only have to buy like $20 worth of stuff in order to last until next week. The only time where I have to pay a little bit more is if I run out of a whole bunch of stuff at once.\n\nFor breakfast and lunch foods there are a couple of rules:\n\n1. Eat a well balanced diet. My breakfasts include one fruit and one carbohydrate/protein. My lunches include one fruit, a sandwich, and what I call a munchable (something easy to snack on like nuts, chips, popcorn, etc.)\n2. Choose things that are relatively quick to throw together. My sandwiches only include two ingredients and nothing has to be cooked.\n3. Buy in bulk with non-perishables!\n4. Try to have a set number of things that you eat. It makes it easier to remember what you need. Again, I eat on a four-day cycle, so it's easy for me to realize when I've run out of one thing like Nutella. I can always give you the list of specifics of what I eat if you'd like (it's completely vegetarian as an added bonus).\n\nFor dinners there are also a couple of rules\n\n1. Eat a well balanced diet. Find at least one veggie that you like. Roasting veggies is very simple and relatively easy to do. All you need is a veggie (like asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, spinach, etc.), some oil, some salt, pepper, and any seasonings that you'd like (I like to rotate through my spice rack; it let's me know what every spice does and ensures that no spice will go to waste). Afterwards, you throw it all together on a sheet tray at 450\u00b0F in the oven for twenty minutes. Easy and done.\n2. Choose recipes that require very few ingredients.\n3. If you choose a recipe that doesn't have very few ingredients, make sure that the ingredients can be used more than once.\n4. Get very used to leftovers. Since I cook like I'm cooking for a family of four (even though I live alone), it normally means that I have a good bit of leftovers. I don't know how it'd be with your roommates, but leftovers save money and leftovers you cook are way better than leftovers other people cook.\n\nThose are just a few suggestions. The main thing is to cook what you like and accrue extra ingredients as you do. I can give you my step-by-step routine of what I eat/shop for in a week.

Being able to hear the instant feedback is always gratifying, but it is definitely not how it is going to sound on stage. This piece sounds very well balanced on this playback software (well, as nice as MIDI would sound), but this is not what it would sound like having an orchestra play it. You ask the MIDI to do very specific things that actual musicians can't do, and with your current dynamics, it would not be well balanced.\n\n-Dynamic shaping can go a lot further. You indicate a good bit of initial dynamic markings like forte, piano, mezzo forte, pianissimo, but rarely do I see any growth or decay with things like a crescendo or decrescendo. They are there but could be included a lot more. Try singing individual phrases and seeing where they rise, peak, and fall and implement a few more dynamic changes.\n\n-Phrasing and breathing are EXTREMELY important, especially to wind players, but to all musicians too. Emphasize that phrasing by writing slurs over lines of thought. If you have trouble parcing out where a phrase should begin and end, sing it. When you feel like you naturally need to breathe, then write your slur over that specific group of notes. Be careful about writing phrase marks for bowed stringed instruments though. The one place where you did write adequate phrase markings were over the strings at the beginning, but a slur for a bowed instrument indicates a change in bow direction. This means that a string player would have to play all of those two phrases with one very long down stroke or up stroke which would be pretty close to impossible. Not even the most experienced composers deal with that stuff unless they want something very specific, so I would leave it alone for now. Breath indications in the form of rests for vocalists are usually enough. Slurs are normally reserved for melismas.\n\n-Go through each individual instrument/line of this piece. Be excruciatingly critical with this next bit: ask yourself if that part is crucial to the makeup of the section. If not, then scrap it. If you think that the musical line is important, then does it sound good on its own? First rule of counterpoint in any form or genre is that every line must sound good in and of itself. If it doesn't sound good, then change it. If it's awkward, make it more manageable.\n\n-There are so many other ways to remove energy in music than modulating down a key center. I'm not saying to change your modulatjon, I'm just saying that you have options. I quite like it! (The one at m. 68 is a bit much though and not that appealing).\n\nOrchestration:\n\n-Trumpets and most brass in general are really loud. You have to adjust dynamics as they go along on both the trumpeter's part and on the rest of an orchestra. Specifically for trumpets, it is very unrealistic to them to play high concert A's or B's at a piano or mezzo piano dynamic marking as you did pretty early on in the piece. For the rest of the orchestra, you have to have them play at dynamics slightly (if not a lot) louder than the trumpets in order to be heard. You'd be very surprised at how easily two trumpets can overpower a 48-person strings section. You also do not need two differently tuned trumpets. Any good trumpet player will be able to play this piece on a B-flat or C trumpet which most people normally have. I'd say default to C just because this is more of an orchestral piece rather than a band piece (but the feel is very Americana and band-like so a B-flat trumpet would work too. Best to leave that decision to the trumpeters).\n\n-Brass (minus the horns in places), harp, and celesta are accessory instruments. Treat them as such. Half of the time when you have the harp playing, it's playing with the full, blunt force of an entire orchestra along with it. It's going to be barely noticeable. On the other hand, you are overusing the trumpets and celesta. They should be used sparingly to make their instruments feel special or to really emphasize something. These instruments also cut very clearly through the sound of an entire orchestra making the primary point of focus for the entire time that they are used.\n\n-Cannons are cool, but they are way over-the-top. Drums would suffice here. Maybe even chimes or bells that signify those passed away. Despite popular belief very few orchestras have designated cannon players. Also realize that cannon (and guns) are LOUD. To hear 21 of those shots would not feel pleasant to anyone involved; much less so to the people they are trying to honor (think PTSD). I would leave them out. Cool idea and concept though.\n\nVoice:\n\n-mm. 40-41 (and places similar) for the bass part. No. Just no. Singers have what is called a passaggio.This is a specific part of the voice that helps a singer transition from chest voice to head voice. For basses and baritones, the start of the passaggio can happen anywhere from A3-B3. Asking your singers to jump from a B2 to a C#4 in the span of a single beat is daunting because you're passing through to a new register. Three things somewhat help alleviate this issue: working into the passaggio by step or by leaping upwards some perfect interval (a fourth, fifth, or octave). Allowing a rest before the notes of different registers would help too. You have a quick E3 that still resides in the chest voice to try and help, but that C#4 a major sixth away will still seem very high. Each voice type has a specific passagio, learn them and make sure that there aren't any awkward leaps.\n\n-m. 62 (and places similar) for the soprano and tenor part. Many, many trained vocalists can easily hit a high B-flat. Most people in choirs sing as volunteers or as amateurs. It would very courteous to write a secondary optional note that isn't as high. Any note above an A4 should get a lower option or should leave lower sopranos and tenors out. Do recognize that if you do this, you won't have as much power as with a full choir.\n\nJust in general, if you are an amateur composer, then you would benefit by reading a couple of orchestration books. The one by Samuel Adler is an amazing resource. Also, listen to orchestration YouTube channels like Orchestration 101 by Thomas Goss. They normally have some very helpful information. Having a composition teacher or professor might benefit you very nicely if you don't have one yet. If you do, then definitely show them this piece and you two can talk about things that need work.\n\nEdit: Oh! Also, the most important thing for any composer is going out and listening to music of different genres and styles. There are many things that you learn by going out and listening to performances.

The harmonies really express a very empty and somber mood to me!\n\nOne thing that I like to ask beginning composers is \"why?\" Why did you write this piece? What message are you trying to convey? Think of how when you're writing an essay, you feel very inclined to really make sure that you're getting your point across. What point are you trying to make here, and how is it coming across. These questions might seem abstract now, but it can affect your pieces in a very real way. You might realize that you really need to emphasize a chord more or linger on a note that doesn't quite mesh with the harmony on purpose. Here, my best guess is that you really love that melody (the main purpose of this musical essay). What do you love about it so much? Is there any way that you can emphasize that quality a bit more? How well does the harmony support your statement?

Thankfully, there were a couple of tips online that really helped. I like to use the repellents more than anything else because a dead nope is still a nope; I\u2019d rather just not deal with them.

Make it feel as if the piece is always going somewhere. Never play two repeated notes the same way twice. Sometimes your pinky goes flat. Honestly, for this piece, playing with the pads of your fingers is probably good because it gives you a soft, warm, intimate sound. Playing with the tips of your fingers allows you to have more dynamic control over the notes. However, there are some points in this piece where it gets louder and you should play with the tip of the pinky for more dynamic control.
