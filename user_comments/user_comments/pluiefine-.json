Well I achieved the goal and because of the pandemic, immigration was shut down - and still is, so that didn\u2019t happen. Because of the burnout I left French entirely for around 7 months because I found zero use for it in my life and I found that I didn\u2019t care enough about native French content to go out of my way to consume it, I just wanted to go back to content in English that I had ignored for almost the entire year I was focused on French. I recently came across a couple of posts by you, OP, and a Portuguese learner who read 50 books in their TL. It seemed like a cool goal and I thought I might try that myself because why TF not. I spent a masochistic amount of time, energy and effort to learn this language and I would hate to see it rust away\u2026 So here I am reading French books and watching French shows again.\nI do wish French was as prevalent here in the US as Spanish.

Until June 2020, I had maybe 60 hours of just learning some vocab, basic grammar or going over pronunciation practice. I was probably A1 at that time. \n\nThen in July 2020 I set myself a goal of reaching C1 in 6 months (I know it was crazy but that insane goal made me study actively on average for about 3 hours everyday for 6 months). So i guess from July 2020 to Jan 2021 I amassed I had about 600 hours of studying. This was all active studying grammar and vocab. Apart from this I also did listening and minimal reading. So maybe 150 hours for that. And I also did lots of speaking practice via italki lessons. Probably a 100 hours easy over this time frame.\n\nFrom Jan 2021 till now, I\u2019ve done no active studying, only immersion and speaking via italki. I just watched shows in french (I never used subtitles), listened to podcasts, read articles, read some bits of books (never read a native level book in all it\u2019s entirety though I just read some chapters from random books). Maybe on average I can say I did 2 hours of immersion per day over this period. But there have been days where I might have spent 5 hours immersing and there have been weeks where I might have had 5 mins of contact only with the language. So maybe 300 hours of immersion and like maybe 50 hours of speaking during this period. \n\nSo in total at the time of this exam I think I had 60+600+250+300+50= ~1260 hours. This is not exact I\u2019m roughly estimating. \n\nI used the Grammaire Progressive textbooks and Kwiziq for grammar. I made anki sentence cards for each grammar rule. I also used the 5000 most common french words anki deck. \nI read news articles intensively but didn\u2019t make flashcards for words I didn\u2019t know.\nI never used subtitles but always watched Youtube videos, series, listened to podcasts.\nFor italki lessons I only ever did random conversation classes where we spoke about random topics spontaneously. \n\nFor the exam I hired a professional tutor for 10 lessons who is an examiner for this exam and she gave me lots of practical advice to form my exam strategy. During our lessons she gave me a random sample speaking topic and we would do mock speaking tests like the exam. I also wrote maybe 4-5 exam essays which she corrected.\n\nIf I had to do learn another language, I probably wouldn\u2019t do anything differently. I think my method worked quite efficiently for me. I\u2019d say that the most important thing was to do it everyday even when I felt down.\n\nIf I had to prepare for this exam again, I\u2019d focus on memorising idiomatic expressions, informal/colloquial words and expressions and perhaps try to learn some more advanced specific vocabulary and synonyms.\n\nEdit: On second thought, if i had to learn another language. I would take it MUCH easier this time. I wouldn\u2019t go as hard as I did like sometimes learning 60 new cards on anki a day. Studying actively for like 3-5 hours on a lot of days.

That will help keep you going when it gets tough (and it gets tough very very soon after you\u2019ve made it past the early beginner stuff). Also, even for languages you\u2019re internally really passionate about, it can get hard to not give up in the early stages when you can\u2019t do much with the language and you\u2019re not seeing fast enough progress. It\u2019s at this point that it really helps to have an external objective tied to your language learning. Like moving to the country or doing a degree there (these things also add a deadline and a sense of urgency that really helps accelerate things). However it could also be other things that you will need the language for, in order to do them eg. watch shows, movies, read books, talk to people online or in your life or go out seeking groups where people speak in that language. \n\nTbh, for me this last point is really what catalysed my language learning. There are times when you get sick of the language (yes, even if you\u2019re really into it) and you might wanna start up another language because it\u2019s new and shiny and you also kinda wanted to always learn it. But, having that external goal of moving abroad or communicating with people or whatever will help you stay anchored to the language and power through in order to ensure that you learn this language well enough to achieve that external end goal. \n\nAgain... most people in the world (not language hobbyists like a lot of people on this sub) learn a language to do things with it. Language learning just for language learnings sake is basically what you\u2019re doing now. You\u2019re just learning it to learn it (from your post I don\u2019t see any specific things you intend to do with a language). Which is totally fine. Some people don\u2019t mind casually studying one language as a hobby just for the sake of it while others like to dabble around as a hobby to pass the time. But unless you have solid things you want to do with the language or need the language for, it\u2019ll be hard for you to find the motivation or kick to push you past the beginner stages.\n\nAnd maybe this is an unpopular opinion here - but focused, goal-oriented learning isn\u2019t always fun. And neither is it really supposed to be. It\u2019s work. Physical work even, as literal new synapses are being formed in your brain as you learn a new language.

You can tune your ear to that later. \n\nThe immediately next advice only applies if you care about working on your accent from the start (which i really recommend but it's not everyone's cup of tea). Although i will add, before learning any language it is important to learn the sounds of the language and learn how to train your ear to hear those sounds.\nIf you want to try to speak french with quebecois pronunciation from the start, look at \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_phonology. \nLearn the IPA alphabet and then learn how vowels are pronounced in quebec (because that's different from how they're pronounced in france). The consonants might also be a new thing for you to learn (if English is your only first language). The IPA will teach you how to pronounce french sounds (this is important because a lot of sounds in french don't exist in english). \n\nMost people don't find grammar books a \"sexy\" recommendation but the Grammaire Progressive du fran\u00e7ais series are the best french grammar books for second language learners. I would definitely recommend using that as one of your resources. It will cover pretty much all the french grammar you need. You can find pdfs of these online too but i much prefer a hardcover grammar book, you can get it off amazon. \n\nI would also recommend a frequency dictionary of the 5000 most used words in french. Frequency dictionaries can really make your learning efficient by teaching you useful words like \"television\" first instead of something random and unlikely to be used by an early learner like \"furnace\". The Routledge French frequency dictionary is in my opinion the best one but you can easily find free lists of such things online. Routledge is also available on amazon. \n\nAnki is a bit of a controversial suggestion but in my experience it's the best way to hammer in vocab and grammar. It's a flashcard app based on spaced-repetition, where you make your flashcard cards (the most effective studying happens when you make your own cards).\n\nThere are many graded readers out there as well but until you get to a point when you know around 2000-3000 words that's really only when i suggest you start reading/watching things because if you only know 600 words how much are you actually getting out of your study time in the initial learning stages? And in the initial stages I would focus on trying to get as much vocab and basic grammar as possible so you can get to an intermediate stage. Because vocab really is what unlocks the skills of listening comprehension, reading and watching media. \n\nGod this turned out so long.\nLastly, 1000% recommend joining r/languagelearning and r/french because those subs have tons of resources and people who are super supportive and helpful. \n\nGood luck!

I also add no English words on my cards even though right now my vocab is that of a French 1 year old. I do this because I found that with translation my brain will hear something in French and then it will spend some moments trying to translate it and THEN I will understand it. However the method I now use works so much better than that. For me at least. \n\nAn example of my cards is like this:\n\nFront just has the word \u201cchien\u201d.\nBack has a couple of pictures of different dogs.\nBelow that is a note that says \u201cle chien\u201d.\nThe back of my anki card also has a recording of someone saying chien. \nAnd just below that are the names of some of my friends\u2019 dogs (\u201chugo\u201d and \u201clilo\u201d) so when I see the the card I think of \u201cle chien\u201d and all the \u201cchiens\u201d in my life. \n\nI always pronounce the word out loud along with the definite article when I see the card so when I think of chien, my brain automatically thinks \u201cle chien\u201d and I know it\u2019s masculin. I will often repeat pronunciation until I can get it as close to the native speaker as I can. (I also spent ages learning and practicing the french IPA sounds so I could learn to pronounce the vowels and consonants correctly).\n\nWhat this has done is that now whenever i see a dog on the street or I speak to my friends and they mention their dog I think of \u201cle chien\u201d and not \u201cdog\u201d and I get so excited that my brain thought in French and I didnt even realise it. Also this means that when I hear a french word I\u2019ve learnt, I immediately think of the picture I saw and what I think/feel/associate with that picture. \n\nAlso every word has two cards. The front of one card is the pictures and back has the word+recording+personal memories/associations. And the other card has the word on the front and the pics/etc on the back. \nI\u2019m also a little extra and create a spelling card for all my vocab words. Which is basically a picture of something and a recording saying the word out loud and I have to spell it. \nAnki automatically creates the back, front and spelling cards for me so I\u2019m basically just putting the work in for one card and Anki makes different versions of it automatically. \n\nFunny anecdote: we have a drink called \u201cla croix\u201d in the US and at work I wanted to tell my colleague I love \u201cla croix\u201d, but my brain could only think of the french pronunciation with the french R and I didn\u2019t wanna sound pretentious so I stood there dumbfounded not being able to remember how to pronounce it in English and I just looked like a monkey just pointing to and he jumped in saying are you trying to say \u201cLA CROY\u201d and I was like sorry I\u2019m not stupid my brain just got hijacked. But it was the best feeling ever even though I looked like a monkey lol. \n\nI understand this is might sound like a crazy amount of work but I love learning french and spending all my time on it. So it depends on how much you want to learn it and how much time you\u2019re willing to give it. The more time spent tbh means I retain it better.

And that accent is very different from the american accent. But when I moved to the US, within months I was automatically speaking with a perfect, native american accent without even realising it. And that definitely happened because I was constantly speaking with natives. \n\nSo my advice would be to speak with a language partner, or online tutor on italki! And also, the better you get at english, the easier it will be to pick up your desired accent since your brain will not be thinking about what vocab, grammar, etc to use and it can focus more on mimicking native sounds.\n\nAnother thing that might be useful: I\u2019m teaching myself french and what helped a lot was learning the IPA for french vowels. French and english sounds use different muscles in the mouth. Just learning where to place your tongue, how high to place it, and also what shape to make your mouth will make you pronounce sounds much like a native. \n\nI\u2019m sure you know \u201cU\u201d in french and english are not pronounced the same.  I only learnt how to pronounce the french U by learning what shape to make my mouth and where to place my tongue.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve learnt how to pronounce American English vowels, my final piece of advice is: listen to recordings of English speakers saying words in the american english accent on forvo.com. And record yourself saying the same word. Then compare the recordings and try to say the word again to match the native. Repeat this process until you can pronounce the word just like the native, or close to it. \n\nBonus advice: Shadowing is great. Shadowing is basically saying the audio simultaneously with the speaker. So get a sentence of a native speaker saying something (rhinospike.com has tons of native audio) and listen to it several times. Then try to say what you hear at the same time the speaker is saying it. This will help you to get the \u201crhythm\u201d of english. \n\nAnd while you\u2019re doing all this - throw in some american movies and TV shows. It will help to get lots of native input so your brain starts to get used to this accent. Also try to imitate the accent when you hear a dialogue. The standard american accent is what you will hear in most movies and TV shows.\n\nIt\u2019s lot of work to perfect pronunciation - i know, I'm currently trying to get native pronunciation in french. Super hard!! \ud83d\ude28 \nBut I can tell you\u2019re determined. If you have a strong enough \u201cwhy\u201d, it can overcome any\u201chow\u201d :)\n\nGood luck!\n\nSorry this is much longer than I intended.\n\nEdit: if you are speaking with an English native speaker - let them know you want them to correct your pronunciation/grammar etc because most Americans at least think it's incredibly rude to correct a foreigner's English.", "created_utc": "1562556331.0", "edited": "False", "id": "et8h5cf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ca5zlg", "parent_id": "t3_ca5zlg", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "pluiefine-", "body": "The standard American accent is the one you might have heard in American movies or TV.", "created_utc": "1562554740.0", "edited": "False", "id": "et8f47z", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ca5zlg", "parent_id": "t1_et6sox5", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "pluiefine-", "body": "Hahaha reading in any languages makes you better with vocab, grammar and writing for that language.
