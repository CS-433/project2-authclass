I'll give you two examples: a hairdresser in Bosnia earns $6 dollars for the same haircut that in the US costs $40. If they both do 10 such haircuts a day, of the same quality, can you really say that the American hairdresser is more productive? Yes prices in Bosnia are lower than in the US, but even when you take that into account  $40 in US is still more powerful than $6 in Bosnia, because in International Markets $6 is $6... so if you want to buy gold or stocks, or a new car for that matter, prices are very similar everywhere, as you access the same global markets.\n\nSecond example would be a production company... Say they are a factory making steel products. There are various categories of steel products and not all of them require high tech. So there is a company in Italy and a company in Bosnia making pretty much the same steel products of the similar quality. They produce similar amount of it per worker and per day. They buy raw materials from the same markets, and generally have similar production costs (excluding labor). In fact Italian company might even have a bit higher production costs (excluding labor). They both export the same products in various European countries and sell it for similar prices. Or perhaps Italians are just tiny bit more expensive.\n\nSo by all measures these two companies are very similar and have very similar productivity. So how does Italian company manage to pay 4 times higher salaries than in Bosnia?\n\nIf you judge by productivity workers should have the same salary. But of course they don't because labor in Bosnia is cheaper, and Bosnian companies can get away with paying such low salaries.

I mean if salaries in such companies are low, then private employers can more easily get away with even lower salaries... it sets precedent of low salaries... and low salaries, mean also low purchasing power, little spending, which all together can cripple economy.

They are speculative and theoretical, that's why they are so interesting!\n\nAnd to participate in such type of discussion, you don't need to quote any studies, all you need is a functioning brain. You can form your own hypotheses  - your opinion, or come up with your own explanations of the things you observe, or even of the results of official studies. This is how actual progress is made. That's how psychologists actually work in research. Conducting actual studies and experiments is just the last phase which will ultimately prove or disprove the theory.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that such type of discussions are not allowed here. We're not allowed to make our own hypotheses or to come up with our own theories, but only to parrot the findings of other studies.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying that me coming up with some new theory or hypothesis ad hoc is science on its own. I'm just expressing my opinion. But my opinion: in form of hypothesis, or in form of theory can be a starting point for the actual study that can prove or disprove it.\n\nOf course just because a random guy on the internet said something, it's highly unlikely that someone will do actual study to try to prove or disprove it...\n\nBut if academic psychologists and researches were a bit more open minded to the opinions, theories and hypotheses of the public (and perhaps a little less arrogant), and if they allowed this type of discussion to take place, they could harvest a lot of interesting hypotheses and theories from the laypeople, from the internet, that they could later refine and test, if they deem them plausible. So even my random opinion could, in theory, be a starting point for an actual scientific study.\n\nThis would allow all of us to participate in the scientific process and to be a bit of scientists.\n\nAnd that would DEFINITELY make those forums way more interesting!", "created_utc": "1661447350.0", "edited": "1661447640.0", "id": "ilr9ozn", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wxh84a", "parent_id": "t3_wxh84a", "score": "2", "subreddit": "askpsychology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t0gc"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "Though I am wondering if this stays forever like this?\n\nHow long would you need to be using L2 and to be immersed in its culture to start to \"feel\" in it like in your native tongue?", "created_utc": "1661416416.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilpiyzs", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wwgf3h", "parent_id": "t1_ilohcoo", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "Yeah I know it was terrible when it comes to disease in these days, but I'm wondering are humans unique in that regard?\n\nI mean, I don't think that many wild animals die that young comparatively, unless they are eaten by predators.", "created_utc": "1661388434.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilo6tb4", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wwzc7j", "parent_id": "t1_ilo4aj1", "score": "1", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "Yeah this is even better answer than mine... you can do it with proportion like I did, but you don't have to, as it's really obvious that it's 1/2 oz of butter per pound of carrots, so you arrived to correct answer with much less calculations.\n\nI just have habit to approach this type of problem through proportions.", "created_utc": "1661387567.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ilo4snq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wwzdce", "parent_id": "t1_ilo45v2", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w844"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "Proportion:\n\n24 / 12 = 35 / x\n\n24x = 12\\*35\n\n24x =  420\n\nx = 420/24\n\nx = 17.5\n\nYou need 17.5 oz. of butter.

So according to this logic whoever ever fantasized or questioned, or enjoyed anything feminine, is trans, and if they don't say it, they are just in denial.

Some studies did find some weak, limited evidence, but even these studies have later been shown to be of poor quality.

So perhaps, even if some paranormal phenomena do exist... the atmosphere in scientific community is hostile to such consideration, and it's likely that it will be rejected without being given serious consideration.\n\nEven some famous challenges, which offer money to anyone who proves the existence of paranormal phenomena,  such as James Randi challenge, have been criticized as dishonest, in sense that they are designed in such a way to make sure that the prize is never given.\n\nSo perhaps if the researchers trying to prove paranormal phenomena were dishonest, professional skeptics can be dishonest too. There's simply a conflict of interest. Skeptic has an incentive to disprove something... they base their whole professional identity and career on it.\n\nI personally suspect that certain phenomena that we associate with paranormal, alternative, etc. might exist, but perhaps scientific community is still not ready to accept them. And it's not just because of reputation or lack of evidence, there's another thing at play as well:\n\nif such phenomena do exist, it would be necessary to completely rewrite current physical theories to allow for the existence of such phenomena and to explain them...\n\nOne thing that I personally sort of believe in is energy healing and reiki. There's a lot of placebo effect going on, but I think placebo effect can't fully explain it.\n\nFor example I've been both hypnotized, and I've also tried reiki. Hypnosis works exclusively based on suggestibility. I can say that reiki definitely feels very different from hypnosis, and I've sort of felt some sort of energy, which is not always completely pleasant feeling and can be quite powerful. For example after one treatment I felt like I needed to lie down for a bit and rest... it felt quite overwhelming.\n\nBut the physics can't explain it, so perhaps, to save their careers the scientists decide it's better to just ignore it and focus on things they can explain. Also you can't find strict evidence for what I experienced because they can always say it's fully psychogenic. But hypnosis, which is, by definition psychogenic, feels completely different. And I've been hypnotized quite deeply at times so I know what I'm talking about. But the only evidence you have for it is my word. You can also try it for yourself and feel the same, and it still wouldn't count as scientific evidence... but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n\nI think paranormal in general is full of fraudsters and con people... a big freak show... but there might be some phenomena that are actually real...

As if for any a bit more serious problem you need to be an expert... It's a bit like human condition itself is getting medicalized. Like all problems come from something in your head.\n\nSometimes people have actual LIFE problems, which can't be easily solved. Yes therapy can make you feel better about it, accept it, deal with it, but it might not solve the objective problem that you have. For example if someone wasted their 20s, they will probably never catch up with their peers in terms of career or finances... They might also never marry or get kids very late, and have objectively much worse life trajectory than those who were successful in their 20s.\n\nTherapy can help you deal with it, but it remains that your position is objectively much more difficult, no matter how much at peace you are with it.\n\nOr another example... you're in a serious debt. Now what?\n\nPerhaps the cause of these problems was mental, like you weren't responsible enough, you were too anxious, you started drinking, etc... if it was dealt with promptly it would perhaps be resolved without much fallout.\n\nBut when the actual fallout happens, therapy can't actually improve your life objectively very much. You still have your problems.\n\nWhatever we do in life has consequences. You can smarten up and become more mature even without therapy, but sometimes it's too late if you already made many mistakes that bring long term negative consequences.\n\nAnd I guess in many situations when people are fighting it's  about such locked-in situations that don't have easy solution. And it's easy to suggest therapy, but therapy won't pay off your debt, or miraculously give you back all the time you wasted.\n\nTherapy is excellent for clearly defined psychological problems such as depression and anxiety in otherwise relatively normal life.\n\nBut if your life is a total mess (because you were stupid at some point in time), no matter how rational, calm and psychologically healthy you are right now, you'll probably still have to deal with all sorts of issues for a long time... which can also be taxing to your psyche as well...\n\nThere is also another type of problems which is neither psychological, nor a consequence of being immature in the past... there are problems that are SOCIAL, like being born in poverty, difficult parents, difficult neighborhood, etc... A lot of such people suffer, and it's not their fault, and they can't even afford therapy even. Just think of the homeless, etc...\n\nNow I'll be a bit cynical...

Here's how I learned Italian, all on my own, from scratch. In around 3 months I reached level around B1...\n\nFrom that point I continued with official courses, schools, etc... but first three months I did all on my own, and in such way, I covered the material they typically do in around 2 years... But I studied every day like crazy, sometimes 4-5 hours a day. At that time I had plenty of free time and nothing else in life to do...\n\nSo here's what I did:\n\nGot a university textbook for Italian... and first learned by heart small dictionary at the end of the book with around 2000 most frequent words.\n\nStudied grammar as if it was maths, to understand it... Did all sorts of drills on conjugations etc... learned pretty much all the grammar by heart. Took me around 2 weeks for grammar.\n\nAfter I learned grammar+2000 words, then I actually did the lessons, which was easy, because I already knew the words and grammar, just had to apply it in practice. There were 40 lessons in the book, each consisting of a short text with exercises. I did it in around 2 weeks as well.\n\nEach lesson gave me chance to review and correct any grammar that I had previously learned by heart, and also gave me chance to apply and practice it. The same is true for vocabulary.\n\nAfter I finished that book I moved on to Italian phrasebook. It's a small booklet around 250 small pages... covers words and sentences useful in all kinds of situations. I've read this whole book 4-5 times, until I reached the point of knowing it all pretty much by heart.\n\nAt that point my brain was full of information but it was still poorly consolidated. I slowed down at this point, tried to give my brain time to assimilate it all. I switched to watching RAI UNO for hours, as well as to listening Italian podcasts while walking etc... Initially, despite all the studying I understood little of what was said. But I didn't give up... I kept listening.\n\nI also started reading jokes in Italian, as well as Italian Wikipedia... Stopped audio input for a while... after some break, when I started with audio materials again, I was surprised that suddenly I understood much, much more than before...\n\nAt that point I enrolled in the official course, but I first did the entry test. After just 3 months of studying I was able to enroll immediately in the third year... skipping the first two years. From that moment I studied more or less in a tradiotional / structured environment... eventually I enrolled in University as well, choosing Italian studies as my major...

That?, etc...\n\nOn the other hand, if my identity is based on biological sex, in a way that I described, there would be no alarm and no concern, as I could find comfort in the fact that my sex-based male identity can comfortably encompass full range of my behaviors and interests including experimenting with make-up, enjoying figure skating or gardening, playing female characters or whatever...\n\nContemporary gender based identity can alarm people and have them start questioning at the slightest deviation from traditional gender roles or expectations... this might be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, I think for people who are truly trans, adoption of sex-based identity would not undermine their desire to fully transition, as for such people just role-playing or experimenting with make-up would not be enough to feel at peace. So I guess, for people who truly wish to transition, sex based identity wouldn't hinder them in their transition, but for people who are perhaps just confused, it would save them from questioning, it would prevent them from being alarmed and confused, just because they have some gender non-confirming tendencies...

If it can't give evidence based answer it remains silent. But in real life you gotta make decisions even in situations where you don't have such answers.\n\nAnd my question is not a banal one. It's a rather important dilemma for a person who seeks to gain more in depth understanding of the human nature. Trilemma is basically between: a) psychology books giving you best insights; b) great literature giving you best insights (classics, Nobel winners etc...) or c) no books can give you any valuable insights that can be compared in impact with real life experience.\n\nA person who has had a lot of real life experience probably wouldn't ask such a question. But if you're like me inexperienced, and you can't get that much experience by force... you might be wondering like I do, whether great novels or psychology literature can give you more insights.\n\nFrom my experience so far... fiction doesn't give you that much explicit knowledge, but gives you a lot of implicit understanding, and perhaps if you read a lot of good books, allows you to build your own way of understanding people in a very robust way, which becomes like a second nature and a skill you develop.\n\nPsychology books on the other hands give you some explicit results, findings, which you then have to try to connect with your life experience, and while the insights are often true and valuable, I also find them often to be quite shallow and unable to fully explain people's behaviors. Also I've noticed gaining something akin to professional deformation after reading too much psychology literature... for example when I learned about Big 5 personality traits, I caught myself trying to explain people in terms of it... but then I realized how shallow it is, and how much nuance is missed...

Reading is better, but books are in many cases worse.  \nReading as an activity is better for your brain, even if what you're reading isn't high quality. Just the activity itself exercises your brain.\n\nBut, books, in many cases are worse than movies and TV shows. It's much lower barrier to entry... it's easier to write a book than to direct a movie or a TV show. So even if quality is questionable, it can still get published. With movies and TV shows there's more at stake, more money and more people involved, so if they think it's too bad, they won't shoot it. This unfortunately also means that movies and TV shows are more mainstream and less likely to be original / innovative. \n\nThen, there's another thing. Books take much more of your time. Therefore if you consider time a type of currency, books are much more costly. This can especially be a problem if you're reading a mediocre book.  For the same price (in terms of time) you pay to read an average 200 pages novel, you can watch 7-8 good movies.\n\nPerhaps if the movies are good, watching 7-8 movies will give you more mental growth and you'll acquire more cultural capital, than by reading just one book. \n\nBooks in general are less culturally relevant, simply because there is much more books around than movies. So if you read a book X, you're less likely to encounter a person who read the same book, so you can discuss it.

The unwillingness to forgive someone their Achilles heel. No matter how good you are in other areas, no matter what good deeds you have done. If you show one weakness, they will bury you over it. I believe that we should have responsibility towards society and contribute to the good of the society. The right and responsible thing during the pandemic is to get vaccinated. It's a way to make your contribution. But there have been many analogue situations in the past where some people simply were unable to contribute in certain domains. For example in war. Not everyone is capable for war. Some are unable, some are unwilling, and some are simply crazy, and for this reason incapable. But they can still contribute in other areas. Let's for a second entertain the idea that Novak is bona fide crazy or incredibly stupid - it wouldn't be too much of a leap given what kind of comments he receives - and if so doesn't a mentally challenged person deserve pity, compassion and understanding, and not hate and contempt?\n\nWhat if this is his Achilles heel, a genuine weakness, a touch of genuine mental illness in his otherwise sharp mind? What if taking the vaccine could prove genuinely traumatic for him? What if he has legitimate phobia, and taking it would damage his mind further and exacerbate his mental issues? Why does the society has to put so much pressure and so much insistence over one single issue? It's often said \"JUST get a jab...\" if it's \"just\"... if it's so unimportant, why so much insistence on it? Clearly it's not just him being stubborn, but also those who would like see him fall over a single issue, and who would insist that he MUST, take it no matter what... and no matter the future course of pandemic. I see his stance on vaccines as genuine weakness and mental issue, but I don't think we should crucify mentally ill people, and we should neither stigmatize them, because the fact that you have depression, or anxiety, or vaccine phobia, should not prevent you from being a productive member of society in all the other areas not directly affected by your mental issues.", "created_utc": "1644964083.0", "edited": "1644964390.0", "id": "hx3gjzp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ssw2eq", "parent_id": "t3_ssw2eq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "tennis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiq1"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "He indeed holds a lot of nonsense beliefs.

Vaccines are perfectly fine. They work and save lives. But vaccine mandate is questionable, because there are people for whom there is more risk then benefit. Vaccines in general are overwhelmingly good. But ignoring such cases is being disrespectful to individual differences, and different situations people are in. Unfortunately, it happens that Novak is at the same time believer in some completely crazy stuff, and also hesitant about vaccines. Which makes him a perfect target for ridicule.\n\nBut on the other hand he is in the right, when it comes to defending personal choice. Because given the realities of this pandemic right now, vilifying all people who don't take vaccine is not a solution I guess. He is into all that woo-woo stuff.

I know vaccines work and help, and can prevent the disease, and save lives. I just don't like the attitudes of some authorities that seems to be like : \"There's only vaccine, nothing else, it's always the best, no exceptions etc.\"\n\nPeople often make parallels with the past, they says, there were mandatory vaccinations in the past, etc... I get all that. But I haven't found a single situation in the past where authorities were adamant that people need to get the jab regardless of their natural immunity. Natural immunity always counted for something, and often was considered superior. Only these days it doesn't matter if you had covid and how many times. It also doesn't matter if you might have concerns because of some other medical reasons, like autoimmune diseases. It's just get the jab, get the jab, get the jab. And the language is ugly.\n\nI didn't get a jab, but i support vaccinations, and I would recommend everyone to get it, especially if they didn't have covid. Why I didn't get it then? Well, I recovered from covid, that's first reason. The second reason is that I didn't get it on time. Now omicron is spreading so fast that I think I don't have enough time to get immunized, before the Omicron spreads. (In South Africa the whole wave lasted 1 month). Third, I am afraid I might be more vulnerable to virus if I get exposed to it, like 5 days after the vaccine. Because then my body will have to deal with the vaccine and the virus at the same time. I wish I took the jab during the summer when the cases were low. But I didn't, and I think it's a mistake. Now in the middle of this madness, I am not sure how much would it help me if I catch a virus very soon. Because it takes time for vaccines to work.\n\nI also have some other medical concerns (I had some symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the past, and even though I am not diagnosed, I might be at risk) and I'm very cautious about exposing myself to any additional risks. So I'm thinking if I can get away from this without getting vaxxed, maybe better to do it this way. \n\nSo I don't consider myself antivax nut... I am for the vaccines, but I can understand people who have some reserves. I think vaccine mandates make divisions among people.\n\nWhen it comes to Novak, he being a public figure indeed is in a very delicate position, because he has to be a good example. And indeed for most people the best choice is to get vaccinated. Because countries with most vaccinations have lowest death rates from covid etc. So this is what he should promote. But unfortunately he happens to be among those who have personal concerns and are hesitant. The problem he has is that he is not a good politician / diplomat. He finds it difficult to argue for something he can't do himself. So instead, he argues for personal choice. This perhaps is not statistically most beneficial policy right now, but it is also a worthy value. Because even if vaccines are good (of course they are), etc... and even if forcing it on people will have net benefit in terms of saved lives, vaccine mandate might also have a more sinister long term effect on well-being of all the people, and that is gradual erosion of freedoms, and a type of society that doesn't care about individual situation of people - doesn't look at people as different and autonomous individuals, but forces everyone to do the same thing, even if for some it's not a good choice.", "created_utc": "1641585562.0", "edited": "1641585798.0", "id": "hroj6sv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rxrsib", "parent_id": "t1_hrodwvl", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tennis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiq1"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "Yes, this is true if you see vaccination as a goal.\nI think vaccination is means towards getting immune for covid.

These two areas are domestic sphere and beauty standards.\n\n1. DOMESTIC SPHERE\n\nWomen  are still expected, even in developed countries, to do most of the  household chores. Cooking, cleaning, dishes, ironing... No matter how  much does she make, and how long hours she works, when she returns home,  she keeps working... taking care of the kids, the kitchen, and the  rest. Men do participate and help, but it's still considered \"a help\",  rather than their proper work. Men are culturally discouraged from  participating, sometimes even by their own wives... (Don't mess with the  dishes, I'll do it...) Of course not all countries are like that, and  not all families are like that. But still, women are expected to do this  work, and men are often discouraged, and if they do it, they can be  considered unmanly, or whatever. This results in woman's life being  filled with much more work than man's life (because housework is still  work), which can indirectly make her career suffer, as she has less time  available for additional payed work, or education, reading, etc... So  instead of employers being evil and discriminating towards women, it  might be that women, have, among the other things, less time to focus on  work, as they have to do the chores and stuff. So it might be just one  of the many reasons for pay gap.\n\n2) BEAUTY STANDARDS\n\nAnother  time sink and money sink for women; and to a big extent also energy  sink and confidence sink. Women are expected to be always nicely  dressed, fashionable, and with make-up. Many companies don't allow going  to work without makeup. Now add to that nailpolish, skin care creams,  hair dyes, etc... Imagine if women just bought stocks (or bitcoin for  that matter), from all the money they spend on cosmetics, how much they  could accumulate over time. Now imagine having to spend 10 minutes (at  least, on average) each morning applying your makeup, and 5 minutes each  evening removing the stuff from your face. How much new stuff could she  learn if she spent the time studying something related to her work /  career, instead? Also, constant make-up is aggressive and can irritate  skin, not to mention that it might contain toxic substances. And we have  just scratched the surface. Women usually don't go anywhere without a  handbag... something that is more of a cultural dictate than an actual  need. The handbags cost money (usually quite a lot, because different  clothes and occasions call for a different type of handbag...) and  restrict movement. Now when how about high heels? They restrict movement  even more... Now how about unattainable beauty standards dished out by  fashion magazines, and anxious teenagers, starving themselves and ending  up with eating disorders, in order to achieve such a look? So beauty  definitely not only costs women time and money, but also energy (both  physical and psychological... mental effort), and confidence...\n\nTo  sum up, feminists today are ignoring these 2 important areas while  focusing on stuff that's either already fine, or unachievable or even  unfair (like artificially setting up quota on the number of public  officials that need to be women, which can be discriminating to some  people who might be refused a job, simply because they are not  female)...", "created_utc": "1613201694.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gn5lbih", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lgl30r", "parent_id": "t3_lgl30r", "score": "4", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk0s"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "But I am sure there would be a niche interest even for that.\nAnd I think the actual aroma is not bad...

It really begs question... how many important things in our world are decided by chance? Do we take our existence for granted in the nuclear age? Perhaps we aren't even aware of the danger that's always present. So every day is a gift. You managed to get me thinking about these things, which is, I guess what you intended to do.\n\nAnother element of the story is the danger of letting ourselves become dysfunctional. Most of us are dysfunctional at times, not performing at our best. It can be for the lack of sleep, psychological problems, sickness, hangover, or any other reason - but when it happens, it can lead us to dangerous situations... not only potentially expensive mistakes at work, but to many other examples of poor judgement, that can lead to disaster. So, your story can also function as a cautionary tale, telling us to avoid doing anything important, whenever we are in any way incapacitated.

I've noticed some slight grammar mistakes... Also, I am undecided about whether it would be better if you went into descibing the situation that happened after Stanislav reporting the signal...

If it's an advanced class, talking about advantages of knowing it even better, being creme de la creme... :D So that students are always motivated to go forward...\n\n\\-  Giving them certain examples from personal experience... (like when I was studying language X, at one point I focused on basic vocabulary... and using this and this book I covered 2000 words easily that gave me a huge boost in fluency... and it took me just around a month)... For most students learning 2000 words in a month will be too much but it will be a great example of what is possible and a great motivator...\n\n\\- Treating students as equals, as partners, admiting that you're still learning... for example saying currently I do this to achieve this and I think it will get me there... so that they know that you (the teacher) struggle as well...\n\nI am quite sure if there was more ***mentoring*** included and not just ***teaching***...  results would be much much better in any school.", "created_utc": "1587231949.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fnszvhq", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_g3ozkt", "parent_id": "t3_g3ozkt", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "aah, now I see ! thanks for clarification!\n\nregarding the session, well why not? :) I think I wouldn't mind...", "created_utc": "1585846048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "fm8axhp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_fscr2h", "parent_id": "t1_fm8a8z4", "score": "1", "subreddit": "HypnoHookup", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vhlv"}, {"author": "hn-mc", "body": "So the effect of the session was to inspire him to share a hot fantasy?

English wasn't an obligatory subject in my primary school, so I wasn't getting grades for it... which allowed me to be relaxed.\n\nThat changed when I got into high school, where we had much stricter and more demanding teacher.

It wasn't that hard because I already knew something, and also English conjugation is simple.\n\nBut only when I learned them all explicitely, comparing one to another, and having knowledge about all the tenses that exist in English, only then has my confusion been cleared, and after that my English grammar skills improved tremendously almost overnight.

In this case it was more difficult because I didn't have any previous exposure to Italian, and Italian conjugation is objectively much harder than English.

Reading English literature without much difficulty, participating in areas of life that are not abstract (such as this online discussion we're participating in), but that require you to get your hands dirty so to say and deal with real things... so it's words you'd use at hairdresser's, car mechanic, doctor, while buying clothes, cooking, participating in hobbies, etc...\n\nFor example in English I know some specific vocabulary related to chess, because I am somewhat interested in chess and I read about it in English, so I know what castling, promotion, endgame, stalemate and checkmate are. But, in my native Serbian, I know such vocabularies even for some areas that I haven't been actively involved in. For example, I know most of the terminology related to cooking in Serbian even though I didn't cook much myself. But I've heard my mum and my grandma speak about it, sometimes I assisted them... so I know pretty much all they speak about. In English, however, I have a lot of gaps in such vocabulary. And in most other \"real life\", \"offline\" areas. And if you want for example to become really close with someone, you must be able to talk to them not just about global issues such as global warming, but also about things such as being irritated by acne and the dilemma whether to drain them or not... and you need to know if they say \"pop the pimple\" or \"squeeze the acne\" or whatever the hell they actually say for describing it...

But then, of course, it's all about the attitude, it's completely legitimate to try to sound as good as possible and as correct as possible, to practice pronunciation etc, but at the end of the day, you need also to own your accent and not to make a big deal out of it. You've spent your formative years in a different country whose language probably has a completely different set of sounds.
