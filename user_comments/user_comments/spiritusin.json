But if you have a serious issue like cancer, you are at the mercy of the hospital and their never-enough resources and often outdated technology and if you're really unlucky, you'll be in the hands of a shitty doctor. In-hospital infections are also pretty common, just the other week 2 newborns died of infections contracted in the hospital right after birth and after a major club fire in Bucharest some years ago, many victims died or had complications because of the same in-hospital infections. They were flown to Western countries for emergency treatment and the hospitals there were shocked at their state. I personally worry every day about my parents ever having to go get checked into the hospital because there's like a 50-50 chance they'll get worse, not better, especially since they're older.\n\nIn the Netherlands there's private universal healthcare (most people pay 120 EUR/mo) with a 350 EUR deductible, it's touch and go whether you get taken seriously for an issue (most times they give you a paracetamol and send you home, their goal is to never overtreat) until it becomes serious and clear what's wrong with you. Then you receive excellent care and you don't pay more than your deductible. My main qualm with the Dutch system is their way of gatekeeping resources until something is very wrong with you - which makes sense most times because people often go to the GP for minor things that really do pass on their own, but this way some symptoms get overlooked and people get much needed treatment later than they should. On the other hand, the Romanian system fills you with pills for anything no matter how minor, it's famous for giving antibiotics for the common cold in the 90s and contributing to antibiotics resistance, so your mileage may vary.\n\nI've seen some cases in both systems that contradict my words, but this is an overview I think is pretty accurate.", "created_utc": "1666252255.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it1lqpr", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8ipde", "parent_id": "t1_it0znbd", "score": "6", "subreddit": "expats", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhwp"}, {"author": "spiritusin", "body": "Yeah I agree in the end, it\u2019s impossible to convince them otherwise sometimes and it\u2019s bad form to say no.

I was constantly with my guard up and very paranoid. This was in Bucharest. \n\nWhat I did was carry pepper spray (never had to use it, but gave me peace of mind to have it) and I\u2019d carry my phone and wallet in a small cross body bag. A very small one is great under a coat but regular cross body bags are good enough even without a coat (so in the summer) because you can keep them in front of you so there\u2019s less risk of someone grabbing it off your shoulder or picking in your backpack.\n\nI also kept 2 wallets which I recommend you do. An important one with your ID, credit/debit cards, other crucial cards and big bills if you use them. A minor one with petty cash, transport card, maybe expired cards too. Use the minor one on a daily basis and keep the important one hidden/in the cross body bag. This way if someone tries to steal your wallet, they\u2019ll run off happy with a wallet with less value to you.  \n\nFind ways to avoid using your phone in areas of risk. Don\u2019t message people if it\u2019s not absolutely urgent, look up places before you leave the house or if you\u2019re in a safe spot. In countries like Venezuela, people even have 2 phones because they get stolen very frequently. One they use outdoors and one they use indoors and/or in safe spots. You could do that too and get an old cheap smartphone to use when in unsafe spaces that has minimal and unimportant apps connected (so no email or banking apps).\n\nSelf defense classes are utterly useless here (unlikely to win in a physical altercation), safest bet is to not give crooks an opportunity, to keep your valuables hidden and to have a means of protecting yourself in case your safety is in danger (pepper spray). \n\nOnce you feel you have some control, you\u2019ll slowly heal from PTSD. PTSD happens a lot in situations where something terrible happens and you can\u2019t do anything (fight or flight), so taking some control will help you. These precautions helped me and they calm my nerves a little when I have to be in unsafe places.
