I have not lived in France long-term, but I did live in France for a total of five months, in five different locations: Dieppe, Paris, Pont St Maxence, Blois, Giverny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. The bakeries are among the best in the world if you're looking for sweets and/or baguettes.\n2. The cities can be quite beautiful.\n3. I personally found the local people to be quite friendly, but I was speaking to them in French, so YMMV if you don't do that.\n4. Public transportation was great compared to America.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. The bakeries are very fattening. Everything seems to have 5x more butter than necessary. For example, croissants are extraordinarily rich in France -- when I moved to the Netherlands, eating a croissant was a whole new experience because suddenly I *wasn't* shoving whole sticks of butter in my mouth. Also, French bakeries are really terrible if you want something savory. Baguette sandwiches are great, but you are out of luck if you want literally anything else. (Serbian bakeries in Belgrade were better in this regard.)\n2. Everything is really far apart. Maybe it's not exactly like the US, but geez major cities in France are extremely spread out. They make up for this with a pretty good public transportation system, but it still takes ages to get places.\n3. I don't like French politics. YMMV, but personally I am lean very far to the left, and France is has been trending more and more right wing over the past decade. Currently the French left is both very splintered and also infected with some crazies. I also don't like their presidential system of governance.\n4. French people go on strike a *lot*. It honestly felt like public transportation ground to a halt every few days while we were staying there. It made getting around the country a huge pain.\n5. France is projected to get drier and drier in the coming century as a result of global warming. I'm not thrilled about moving to a country with long-term concerns about water sustainability.\n6. France is the most anti-vax of all EU countries, and they are also REALLY obsessed with homeopathy. That kind of anti-science stuff makes me really uncomfortable.\n7. I personally find French food to be pretty bland. I don't like their philosophy that \"ingredients should speak for themselves\". I want herbs and spices chucked into my food by the fistfull! I want complex layers of flavor like what I grew accustomed to in China and Thailand. Also, when cream and butter are primary ingredients in almost everything you eat, you get pretty sick of cream and butter. I swear to god they almost put cream and butter in their soda, it's *that* omnipresent.\n8. France gets pretty hot in the summer. I'm a cold weather kinda guy. I prefer for weather never to get above 25C.\n9. Train tickets are *obscenely* expensive unless you buy them very far in advance, which severely hampers your ability to sponataneously use the rail system. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest to me that a French train ticket is going to cost you *five times more* per kilometer of distance traveled than a Norwegian train ticket would, assuming both tickets are purchased at the time of travel. And Norway isn't exactly known for its stellar train network! French railway tickets suck ass.\n\nPersonally, I found visiting France to be pretty enjoyable, but I don't think I would want to live there permanently.", "created_utc": "1666428465.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itb7izf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y9v7y0", "parent_id": "t3_y9v7y0", "score": "5", "subreddit": "AmerExit", "subreddit_id": "t5_5b1mph"}, {"author": "JakeYashen", "body": "It is legit hard to tell", "created_utc": "1666255297.0", "edited": "False", "id": "it1p313", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y8cejz", "parent_id": "t1_it1p19d", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3"}, {"author": "JakeYashen", "body": "Okay but seriously I'm gay and I recently started watching straight porn for the first time and I swear to god I can only see two holes.

I wouldn't trust the food standards in China so much, but at least in China healthy eating (i.e. lots of vegetables, not so much deep frying, little sugar, etc etc) was the default. It was not hard to eat a healthy diet in China, unlike in America where that always felt like a struggle to me. The worst country in this regard was Serbia. They seem to exist on a diet of meat, cheese, bread, and little else.\n\nThe cost of living was better for (almost) every single country I went to, including expensive countries like Norway and Sweden.

In English, there exists only one way to stress a syllable (high pitch and volume, falling in the following syllables). In Norwegian, there exist two ways of stressing a syllable, known as tonem 1 and tonem 2. The difference between the two varies from dialect to dialect, but in Urban East Norwegian (centered around Oslo):\n\n- In tonem 1, the stressed syllable is pronounced with low, flat pitch.\n\n- In tonem 2, the stressed syllable is pronounced with high-to-low falling pitch\n\nMuch like how stress in English is unpredictable and must be memorized for each multisyllable word, pitch accent in Norwegian is not predictable. Learners of the language must identify and memorize the pitch accent of every 2+ syllable word. In other words, learners must know not only *where* words are stressed, but also *how* those words are stressed.\n\n[Further information and demonstrations](https://youtu.be/UFpJjmQQXjc)", "created_utc": "1663660173.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip63048", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xi8i9z", "parent_id": "t1_ip60mrw", "score": "3", "subreddit": "norsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uhx1"}, {"author": "JakeYashen", "body": "I mean, I guess I would think of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland as \"less European\" than, say, France, in the same way that I'd consider Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia European, but \"less European\" than Albania.", "created_utc": "1663625746.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ip4dwc8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xi5cf1", "parent_id": "t1_ip1u0lp", "score": "2", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "JakeYashen", "body": "Yes I am currently stalking all of your linguistics comments.

Beauty is important for human psychology! It shouldn't be underestimated. Depending on the kind of gardening you are doing, it may also keep you physically active, and in touch with the outside world.\n\n*Swimming* keeps you physically fit. Being physically fit, aside from being incredibly sexy, is incredibly beneficial for your health.\n\n*Spending all day with your friends* builds and maintains your social network. Humans are social animals. Having a network of relations is important for our well-being. Face-to-face interaction is also better than long-distance interaction, all other things being equal.\n\n*Working* all day, especially chronically, can be bad for your mental or even physical wellbeing, but here again you are producing something of value that will last. You are earning money. You are advancing your career. You are developing and/or reinforcing skills that will help you in other work in the future. You may even be building a portfolio that you can use for the rest of your life.\n\nGaming is different from these things because, once you put down the games, there are virtually no lasting benefits, at least not compared the quantity and quality of benefits that one might derive from other hobbies such as sewing, sports, learning languages, cooking, and so on. You can become really really incredible at Halo -- and those skills will certainly transfer to playing *other games* very well -- but when you turn off the computer or the television, you have essentially nothing to show for the hours you have put into it, except perhaps for the social connections you may have developed, which you could have developed with a more productive pastime anyway.\n\nNone of this is to say that gaming is \"a waste of time\" or inherently bad. There is inherent value in doing something that you enjoy. However, gaming just isn't productive in the same way that many other pastimes are. So, you should consider that hours you spend on gaming are lsrgely a sunk cost, and factor that into how much time you spend on it. I personally would not advise spending a very significant amount of your time on gaming.\n\n(I'm excluding shopping here because I think chronically shopping all day is pretty bad, and not to be put on a pedestal at all.)\n\n\n\ngardening\nswimming\nshopping\nworking \nfriends", "created_utc": "1660502141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ika8qau", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_woa4b3", "parent_id": "t3_woa4b3", "score": "1", "subreddit": "tumblr", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7hk"}, {"author": "JakeYashen", "body": "I take all comments and criticisms seriously.

Vaguely I'm imagining a rough road map that looks something like this:\n\n1. Study pronunciation and outlines of grammar (Oslo dialect) (3-6 months)\n\n2. Acquire 10.000-20.000 vocabulary terms (Oslo dialect). Exercise listening comprehension through a combination of videos, music, movies, TV series, conversation classes, and audiobooks. (2 years)\n\n3. Study Nordnorsk, as well as the dialect in Bergen and Trondheim, and possibly 1-2 other dialects. Acquire 300-2.000 vocabulary terms per dialect (exact number depending on what is deemed appropriate). Attempt to practice listening comprehension using conversation classes with speakers from various locations in Norway. Continue to refine general skills with audiobook and other media content. (2-3 years)\n\n4. Begin acquiring listening comprehension skills in Swedish. Use Swedish-->Norwegian flashcards to increase receptive comprehension of vocabulary and speech. Acquire 2.000-8.000 words.\n\n5. Evaluate further which areas need improvement, and which areas can be neglected. Decide if listening/reading comprehension of Danish is worth pursuing.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. Be able to speak, read, and write Norwegian (Oslo dialect) competently within 3 years, and with a high degree of proficiency within 7 years.\n\n2. Be able understand a wide array of dialects from across Norway. Be able to converse with Norwegians from diverse regions without requiring them to modify their speech patterns to make themselves understood. In short, listening comprehension should be robust, and not subject to breaking down if speaking to someone who does not speak the Oslo dialect. I expect to reach this level within 7-10 years.\n\n3. Be able to consume media, such as music, or news articles, in Swedish with perhaps B2 comprehension. Be able to understand casual spoken Swedish with few problems.\n\nIn general, I feel this is a very reasonable set of goals to have. Norwegian/Swedish/Danish together are classed as separate languages for political reasons, but linguistically are better described as a dialect continuum. I'm not sure if learning any amount of Swedish would help with Norwegian...but at the very least it couldn't hurt, and would give me access to a much wider array of media.

It is normal for all learners for active skills to lag behind passive skills, including native speakers. My recommendation would be to use Anki to memorize 10 words per day -- be able to see them and pronounce them, and know their meaning -- and then gradually increase that to some higher number over the span of several months (or even 1-2 years) as you become more accustomed to memorizing large volumes of information. I do not recommend going higher than 40 words per day, even if you think you could handle it. I personally cap myself at 30 words per day, and I've been learning languages for a decade.\n\nMemorization is a skill. It will become easier over time the longer you do it.\n\nAnyway, while you are doing that, maybe focus on acquiring active production skills for 3 hanzi per day. That puts you on track for 1000+ known hanzi by the end of one year, at least in theory.\n\nBe consistent with your studies, but do take extended breaks every once in a while for your mental health (to avoid burnout).
