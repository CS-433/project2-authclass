I'm a grad student in health psychology studying weight-neutral approaches to health promotion, so I think I can give some scientific background on this.  I haven't read through *all* of the comments, but from what I've seen, they are mostly focusing on the equality/justice/ethics side of the body positivity movement and/or the lived experiences of people labeled overweight or obese.  I think that both of these are very, very important perspectives on this.  I'll try to tackle OP's question from the scientific, scholarly perspective.  I recently did a scholarly review of the literature in this area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:  Health behaviors, like eating nutritiously and exercising regularly, have a much larger effect on health than what someone weighs.  Obese people who do these things generally have better health outcomes than lean people who do not.  Improving health behaviors improves health, even without weight loss, and is more sustainable than trying to lose weight.  DIETS DO NOT WORK (for more than about 6 months, anyway), and long-term weight loss is very difficult because of our physiology.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The key takeaways:**\n\n**1.**  **It is not true that excess body fat has** ***no*** **effect on health; however, health behaviors (like eating nutritiously, physical activity) have a** ***much larger*** **effect on health than excess body fat.**  In other words, the role of weight is greatly overshadowed by the role of health behaviors.  \n\nSources:  see below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. People labeled obese who regularly engage in health behaviors often have health outcomes that are** **the same as or better than** **people labeled \"normal\" weight or \"healthy\" weight.**  In other words, an obese person who exercises regularly and eats nutritiously can have the same health outcomes as a lean person in the \"healthy\" weight range.  \n\nSources:  [Matheson, King, and Everett (2012)](https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2012.01.110164), table 3 has the best breakdown.  [The Fat vs. Fit Study, Barry et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2013.09.002)  Notice how the hazard ratios for obese people in the higher health behavior groups and fit groups are nearly the same or lower than for \"healthy\" weight people, especially in the lower HB and unfit groups.\n\n*(I put both normal and healthy in quotes, by the way, because neither are truly accurate descriptors of this weight range.  Being in this weight range is no longer statistically normal/normative, and being in this weight range does not guarantee good health or necessarily indicate bad health.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. People labeled \"normal\" weight or \"healthy\" weight who do not regularly engage in health behaviors often have health outcomes that are worse than obese people who do.**  The flip side of the above point.  Being in the \"healthy\" weight range does not mean you are necessarily healthy or that it is less important for you to live a healthy lifestyle.  Obese people who exercise regularly and eat nutritiously generally have better health outcomes than \"healthy\" weight people who do not.  \n\nSources:  In the Matheson and Barry studies above, notice how the hazard ratios for \"healthy\" weight people in the lower HB and unfit groups are higher than for obese people in the higher HB and fit groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Health can be improved without weight loss by improving health behaviors.  This weight-neutral approach has been shown in randomized trials to be as effective at health improvement** ***and possibly more sustainable*** **than weight-loss approaches.**  In other words, weight loss is not necessary to improve health; exercising and eating nutritiously alone improve health sustainably.  This has been shown in several studies that randomize half of the participants to a weight-loss program and half of the participants to a weight-neutral health behavior program.  Those in the weight-neutral program generally improve their health to the same extent as the weight-loss group.  In one trial, these improvements were sustained better as well.\n\nSources:  [Mensinger et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.06.006).  [Bacon et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2005.03.011)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Weight loss is much, much more difficult than most people think.  In fact, there is not good scientific evidence that weight loss of more than about 10% in the long-term is realistic for most people.  This is due to several physiological processes in the body that oppose weight loss.**  In other words, while it is important (in terms of health) for obese people to live a healthy lifestyle, eat nutritiously, and exercise regularly\u2014just like it is for lean people\u2014it is not realistic for most obese people to lose enough weight to be in the \"healthy\" weight range and maintain this in the long-term.  Most weight-loss programs work for about 6 months, but by 1 year, most improvements in weight loss and health are gone.\n\nSources:  [Ge et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m696), see the conclusions in the abstract for a very quick summary.  [Greenway (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2015.59) for the physiology\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. Dieting is not an effective way to lose weight and poses some health risks.  NEVER ENCOURAGE A CHILD OR ADOLESCENT TO DIET.**   \"Going on a diet,\" using a fad diet, etc. is not a good way to try to lose weight.  It is not effective for more than about 6 months, is more likely to lead to weight gain in the long term, and is a predictor for developing an eating disorder.  It is much better to focus on slowly and sustainably changing exercise and eating patterns.  This is especially true for children and adolescents, who are more likely to develop an eating disorder after dieting.  Dieting, for any age group, generally leads to weight cycling (losing and regaining weight), which poses risks to your health.\n\nSources:  Ge et al. above.  [Golden et al.
