Hopefully it will make it seem not worth it at all. You know the shame, you know the pain and how it feels like to be disappointed with yourself. I know you do not want that anymore, and I know you can change for the better! Just imagine a future-self, a better version of yourself, free of guilt, anxiety and PIED. That is the future you want for yourself and all the porn-dopamine in the world cannot make you as happy as you could become if you quit it once and for all.

I think knowledge is power in that regard and the five question above also stem from one of the books. You can read, in no particular order:\n\n1. Your Brain on Porn by Gary Wilson\n2. The Porn Trap by Wendy & Larry Waltz (the 5 questions plus many more)\n3. The Porn Myth by Matt Fradd\n\nI feel like reading helps a lot, especially during the first few days/weeks, because you learn so much about the negative effects of porn.

What you need to do is to find out, why you even ended up in the place you are right now. You can start by answering the following questions for yourself:\n\n1. what problems has porn caused me in the past?\n2. what problems am I experiencing today because of my porn use?\n3. How has porn changed me in ways I do not like?\n4. How does my porn use hurt my intimate partner or others?\n5. What problems could occur in the future if I continue to use porn?\n\nYou should not just shallowly think about the answers but actually write them down. A few paragraphs per question minimum. Go deep inside you, you don't need to share that with anyone but yourself.\n\nIn addition to the above questions, try to think back to when it all started. What did you feel back then? What made you go back to porn? Did you already notice some triggers that make you want to watch porn? Maybe whenever you are stressed or sad? Also you always have to be in the \"I am quitting this\" stage. That means, even after a relapse, you need to get back on track immediately and try your hardest to prevent further relapses. If you answer the first five questions, you can go back to them and read them, whenever you have urges. That should make the relapse seem much less attractive, because you are consciously thinking about the problems it causes you.\n\nThe first step always has to be to assess your situation thoroughly.
