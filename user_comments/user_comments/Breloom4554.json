(on avg - some I studied for 3 hours and other not at all). If I didn\u2019t have a full time job and studied more hours a day I\u2019m sure theoretically it\u2019s possible to reach B2. I also have no personal interest in French - which is often a powerful motivator.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n1. I speak English natively and Spanish (C1). I barely needed to study grammar at the beginning because I could often translate literally from Spanish. My passive vocabulary is also huge (especially written) just by knowing English.\n\n2. Your first language is often the hardest. I had already taught myself 2-4 languages (depending on how you count it), so I knew how I learned a language \n\n3. I lived in a Francophone area. Surprisingly, I don\u2019t think this was really helpful. Once you\u2019re B1+ immersion helps a lot, but as a total beginner it was pretty useless. I also had a fulltime job in English. \n\n4. I took a few linguistics classes in college - so I already knew about stuff like allophones, phonemes, register, TAM etc.\n\n\nWhat did I do? I spent a week learning the sounds of French (I already knew IPA). I then memorized the 700ish most common words and 50 most common verbs (across the basic tenses - present, imperfect, pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, etc). Then I met 2-3 times a week with a tutor for conversation practice, and listened to French podcasts/watched Netflix or Youtube.\n\n\nNot saying you\u2019re slow.
