If you use it for something like vocabulary or sentence mining where you can easily create tens of thousands of cards over the years and you save only one minute per card you save a huge amount of time. Besides Anki, tools like ShareX and Autohotkey can automate a lot for you too. E.g. for sentence mining I can start recording audio with ShareX by pressing F3 and pressing it again to stop recording and copying the audio directly to the clipboard so I can just paste it into the audio field of my card.\n- Take the time to learn a bit about HTML, CSS and Javascript and make your cards beautiful and add little features with Javascript where it is useful. Doesn\u2018t cost that much time compared to the time you\u2018ll put into creating cards. But makes learning much more pleasant.\n- Read the manual from the beginning, even if you don\u2018t understand everything. But you\u2018ll see what Anki can do. Learning about a feature like furigana after creating 2000 cards can be really frustrating. Same for addons.\n- The brain works best with visual stuff. Try to always add pictures to cards. You\u2018ll improve your memorization by around 10-20% if the pictures represent the learning material well. Just use something like Google Images, copy the picture to the clipboard and paste it into Anki. With the addon Image Resize you can make sure that they don\u2018t waste too much space and bandwidth.\n- If you\u2018re learning extremely difficult cards where you have a big amount of errors, limit the cards to 10 for the review so the cards you got wrong come up again very quickly and you still have some memory about them. After the 10 cards are done add the next 10 until you\u2018re done. That works much better than going through 50 cards in one run. The result is better too.\n- Don\u2018t disable the auto bury feature. I did it for nearly four years and that was the biggest mistake I ever did in Anki.

I started learning kanji which something like that. They work for the first few (and easy) kanji but overall that's a bad concept that doesn't really work for more complex kanji later on. So if your book does something like that, it is not good in my opinion. Kanji are constructed out of a quite limited amount of building blocks (the radicals) and a good learning method is to give every radical a meaning and then write a little story where all the radical meanings lead to the kanji meaning. All the methods I listed do that.\n\nThe Abroad in Japan YouTube channel made an entertaining video about that method which explains it very well:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sspUdoV9Il0\n\nThere's also a good website where people share their mnemonics:  \nhttps://kanji.koohii.com/\n\nI'd also recommend to read the introduction texts from Kanji Damage. Kanji Damage is often looked down onto a bit because it sounds like it was written by a 14 year old who wants to sound edgy and a lot of its mnemonics are based on memes. But its introduction texts have some very interesting comparisons to Latin letters that help a lot in the beginning to understand how radicals and kanji work. Here's the website:\n\nhttp://www.kanjidamage.com/\n\nKanji Damage also chose the most relevant pronunciations and integrated them into the mnemonics. So its a good source for that too. I think that's a really good idea and I wish I had done that with RTK. Usually it's recommended to learn all pronunciations with vocabulary but after around 1500-2000 words you will learn a huge amount of words that constantly use the same onyomi pronunciation. If you already learned them with the meanings your life will be easier. But don't learn all pronunciations for every kanji, that's just a huge waste of time because there are a lot of pronunciation that are used only in one word.\n\nYou will also notice that learning kanji is quite easy but keeping them in your memory is the hard part. A SRS system like Anki fixes that problem.

So you can\u2018t really tell how a romaji transcription sounds intuitively.\n\nI\u2018m German and romaji and German are a very usable combination. Nearly all kana letters sound like we would pronounce their romaji transcription. Even the exceptions like \u3075, \u3072 and \u3089\u308a\u308b\u308c\u308d sound at least quite similar. Also our writing system is quite consistant to how we speak so we don\u2018t have multiple pronunciations a romaji transcription of one kana could have in English.\n\nI started using hiragana from the beginning but in my opinion it is a real problem with grammar. You are directly confronted with all the exceptions (\u306f pronounced like \u308f, \u3078 pronounced like \u3048 etc.) while you are still struggeling with distinguishing similar looking characters like \u306f\u307b\u307e.\nFinally I switched back to romaji despite all the warnings and had no trouble at all.

Quite the contrary. You\u2018ll benefit from it.\n\nUsually then comes the argument that you should get as much exercise as possible with kana but the few hours you\u2019re using it for stuff like grammar is absolutely nothing compared to the hundreds to thousands of hours you\u2018ll put into immersing into native content to get to a decent level.\n\nWell\u2026 looking forward to all the toxic downvotes posts like that always get here, I don\u2018t care. \ud83d\ude04", "created_utc": "1650321325.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i59me9e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u6oc4m", "parent_id": "t3_u6oc4m", "score": "4", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "kafunshou", "body": "Export them as CSV, import them into a spreadsheet app and use the bulk letter function of the word processor app to insert them into a layout to print.", "created_utc": "1650312380.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i591mut", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_u6ln0t", "parent_id": "t3_u6ln0t", "score": "5", "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm"}, {"author": "kafunshou", "body": "Yeah, the publisher is kind of an insider tipp. The books don\u2018t seem to be sold in normal German bookstores, they rank poorly on Amazon, they don\u2018t exist as ebooks and they look like they were written and layouted in Word.

Just search for a frequency list and pick the maybe 200 or 300 most used ones. E.g. \u6c34=sui or \u7523=san. In the beginning, say N5+N4 vocabulary, you won't profit that much from it. It may even seem like a bad choice because you will have a lot of words with the kunyomi pronunciation. But that will change massively with the N3-N1 vocabulary and beyond. Onyomi will dominate then and you will see that only one or for some kanji two onyomi will be used countless times. The other pronunciations can be treated as special cases that you just learn with the vocabulary.\n\nA good base for the important pronunciations is the Kanji Damage method:  \nhttps://www.kanjidamage.com/\n\nThe method is, well, a matter of taste, but it's worth the time to read the introduction (a lot of useful analogies between Japanese and Latin writing) and look how the data was structured there compared to RTK.\n\nAt some point your brain will \"rewire\" and you instantly know the pronunciation and you won't think about the kanji meaning at all.

RTK1 features the meanings and stroke order for the jouyou kanji, that is what you're reading right now. RTK2 features their pronunciation. And RTK3 features additional kanji with meanings and pronunciation.\n\nRTK1 is quite popular. RTK2 not so much, its method is not as easy and useful as the method in RTK1.\n\nLearning the pronunciation of kanji is a difficult topic (and you will get childish downvotes here no matter what you're writing). Usually you learn them with the vocabulary automatically and it is quite stupid to learn them all with the kanji. But I would say it has a lot of advantages if you pick the most common kanji (maybe 200) and learn their most common onyomi pronunciation as it will make learning vocabulary much easier if you reach the point where you learn thousands of Chinese loanwords or words that were created based on Chinese loanwords.\n\nYou also will encounter countless identical or very similar words. An infamous example would be \u3053\u3046\u3057\u3087\u3046. There are nearly 30 different words with that pronunciation that are spelled with different kanji combinations. Japanese keyboards usually show you a list ordered by relevance where you can choose the word you meant.\n\nAlso don't expect that the kanji meanings will make sense in all words. They will make sense in a lot of words but not in all. The reasons are different. Some have multiple meanings and Heisig picked only one per kanji in RTK. Also there are a few (not that many, 99% are fine) wrong or stupid choices he made. If you use a website with community mnemonics like Kanji Koohii you will find comments that point the problems out and you then can choose a better meaning. And finally there are also words where the meanings just don't make much sense. You just have to live with it and don't think too much about it. \u4ed5\u65b9\u304c\u306a\u3044.\n\nIf you reach a certain point of fluency you won't think about the kanji meanings anymore at all. But it is still useful to learn them because unconsciously your brain still uses them and it will speed up your vocabulary learning because they often make sense in words.\n\nI also used RTK1 and never regretted it.

Japanese uses countless English loanwords. You can ignore hiragana, it is useless without kanji and vocabulary.\n\nPhrases always help. Also some etiquette rules.\n\nFor translations I\u2018d recommend DeepL. It is halfway okay. Google Translate is really bad for Japanese. A really good translator software for Japanese doesn\u2018t exist yet. Some specialities of Japanese like leaving out pronouns still confuses all of them more or less. DeepL guesses the pronouns correctly in around 60% I would say while Google Translate is nearly always wrong.", "created_utc": "1636807057.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hkg8zjv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_qt04lr", "parent_id": "t3_qt04lr", "score": "0", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyls"}, {"author": "kafunshou", "body": "Nowadays with all the stuff on the internet and endless content for immersion on Netflix, Kindle, Podcasts and YouTube - sure.

And pitch accent seems to be unnecessary in the beginning but can be useful later on (I don't do much with it myself right now but I force myself at least to listen to it so I'm getting trained in hearing it).\n\nFor the pitch accent addon you just have to create a new field that it will fill and configure which field contains the Japanese word. That's it. Nearly no effort and everything then works completely automatically. I'd recommend using that from the beginning so every card gets pitch accent information. It's about five minutes of work and even if you don't need it, it wasn't much effort.

How to include it is covered in detail in the Anki manual.\n\nJapan had a kanji reform after the Second World War where a few kanji were altered and don't look identical to their Chinese counterparts anymore.

Sometimes a movie or a game is dubbed naturally (e.g. Tomb Raider from 2013) and you immediately notice that positively. It's the main reason why I prefer the original audio, I can't really stand German dubbing.\n\nRegarding the dialect it's similar. In German tv shows dialect is sometimes used but usually in a dumbed down version so it is understandable for all Germans. German dialects are so different that real dialect from the south wouldn't be understood by people from the north for instance.

When I started learning Swedish I didn\u2018t already know how to conjugate a verb to past tense but I intuitivily understood when a Swedish verb was in past tense. Quite fascinating, never had something like that in other languages. Even some irregular verbs are similarly irregular in both languages. But a few things are still quite different, e.g. Swedish attaches the definite article at the end (English: a car, the car; German: ein Auto, das Auto; Swedish: en bil, bilen).\n\nAnd as already said, the pronunciation is often very different.\n\nBut it\u2018s a much better base for learning German than English, French or Spanish.

They now have a big pool of musicians and with the three avengers they could also temporary replace Moa if she gets sick.

Only the hi and the r syllables are a bit different. Easier to speak than English or French for us. Chinese is a nightmare compared to that.\n\nHiragana and Katakana are very simple, you can learn both in a few days (or even one).

But h\u00e0nz\u00ec was designed for Chinese and makes sense while kanji is a Chinese concept forced onto a very different language with hiragana as a helping workaround. Therefore kanji is a real mess in some regard. But it is not the hardest part in my opinion. E.g. Japanese has only around 50 or 100 syllables, depending on how you count it (\u4e94\u5341\u97f3). All words are build with them. So everything kind of sounds the same. After learning Japanese for three years now this is still a difficult part while I\u2018m used to kanji quite well.\n\nLearning thousands of characters is much more easy than I thought btw. It just takes time but it is not so difficult. Took me five month to learn the 2136 jouyou kanji.
