For example, me cepillo los dientes, te maquillas la cara\u2026 because the pronounce states who the reflexive action is being performed on we don\u2019t need to use the possessive. \n\nPonerse is a bit tricky because of poner\u2019s flexibility in definition.

Here we go. You ready? \n\nA reflexive verb is a verbs that is performed by someone or something on or to itself. That means that if someone is doing a reflexive verb they are directly going to be impacted by the verb! Let\u2019s look at some fun examples! \n\nLavarse is a great example to start with! How many hands do you have? Are they only your hands? You don\u2019t share them with anyone else, right? Because your hands are yours and nobody else\u2019s, when you wash your hands you are performing an action on yourself. So to say I wash my hands we say, \u201cme lavo las manos.\u201d  You see this cool blue plate? (Pulls sick looking blue plate out of bag) This is my plate. It isn\u2019t part of my body. If I it breaks I won\u2019t feel any pain, right? So if I were to say I wash the plate I\u2019d say, \u201cyo lavo el plato.\u201d Let\u2019s look at something a little more complex. \n\nLevantarse is our next example. You\u2019re a strong wee fella. Pick up that pencil. You just picked it up, right? In Spanish we could say, \u201ct\u00fa levantaste el l\u00e1piz.\u201d The pencil is not part of you. If the pencil broke you\u2019d be fine, correct? Now what do you do after you wake up? You get up, don\u2019t you? In Spanish when you get up you say, \u201cme levanto.\u201d  For example, this morning I got up at 6am.\u201d Esta ma\u00f1ana me levant\u00e9 a las seis de la ma\u00f1ana.\u201d I pulled my body out of the bed. A crane didn\u2019t pull me out, my mum didn\u2019t pull me out, and the dog didn\u2019t drag me out either. Since I performed the action with my body which caused a reaction on my body, the verb used is reflexive. Are you following along? Makes sense now doesn\u2019t it! Final example! \n\nThink about your routine in the morning. Your mum tells you to get out of bed and what does she say to do next? Brush your teeth? (Cepillarse los dientes) Take a shower? (Ducharse) Did you get punched in the face on the playground and decided to hide the bruise with makeup? (Maquillarse) You are doing all of these things to yourself! You\u2019re a big fella, mum doesn\u2019t need to brush your teeth or hair. Mum doesn\u2019t wash you now, you can do that yourself! We don\u2019t want mum seeing we are wasting her makeup so she sure as hell ain\u2019t putting it on your face. You are doing them all to yourself and by consequence are having an action performed by you to you.

She always encouraged us to initiate conversations in Spanish unless it is blatantly obvious they are not Spanish speakers. According to her, the worst thing they can do is say they don\u2019t speak Spanish and ASSUME you\u2019re being racist.
