When a non-native speaker makes a mistake, they may either be met with irritation because the person with whom they\u2019re talking doesn\u2019t know how hard it is to speak perfectly, or met with praise for how hard they\u2019ve tried and have the mistake glossed over for that reason. Neither approach is helpful for getting better, really, and it can be hard to have someone be honest but also actually give useful language advice at higher levels.\n\nI can see where you\u2019re coming from with having other people not really get why you don\u2019t feel entirely happy with your progress, because I feel similarly. I\u2019ve put a lot of time into learning my second language, but people are quick to offer praise and really reluctant to correct me because 1) they can correct me but not explain why the grammar works that way 2) they don\u2019t care enough to try to explain because it can be an exhausting interaction 3) they don\u2019t want to correct me and have it come off as an insult. I don\u2019t expect people to want to correct me because it can get exhausting really fast, but it does bother me to make the same mistakes for years before I either find out on my own or someone finally tells me I\u2019ve been messing up the same thing for that long. It\u2019s hard when others take the idea that you\u2019re not happy with your progress as a statement of humility rather than just a statement of fact\u2014having more to learn really doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing.\n\nThe way I see things in terms of people talking about being on a journey is that it\u2019s a great way to consider language progress if you have perfectionistic tendencies. Otherwise, knowing that I have these little errors that I might never be able to perfect after years and years of study would drive me crazy. You don\u2019t seem to have that problem which is great because you can look at what natives are doing and learn from it without it affecting how you see yourself, but I think a lot of others do, which is why they consistently offer that perspective. Plus, I think it helps people avoid the trap of trying to do everything so efficiently that they focus more on doing things they hate to study than on making discoveries as you grow and change. If you\u2019re gonna study for years, the speed and intensity of your study will likely fluctuate as responsibilities do. Really, calling it a journey works for me because it\u2019s a way for me to take ownership over my progress and compete with myself rather than a yardstick someone else came up with. If that doesn\u2019t work for you, that\u2019s totally fine!

There are people who might not be able to communicate as well as they themselves would like, but who have the intent of communicating to help the people they communicate with. I know because they talked to me and told me so in my TL (we were talking about helping monolingual people in my NL).\n\nThink about how you\u2019d feel if a Korean person came up to you and tried to ask you directions.

Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill...What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.\n\nI don\u2019t think we get anywhere near as much out of hours of scrolling social media as we do from doing things that challenge us and give us a chance to grow as a result. Every so often, it\u2019s perfectly normal and healthy to need a break from intense things, but if life just becomes the break, it doesn\u2019t really feel like a break anymore. \n\nIf you want to learn those languages, go for it!
