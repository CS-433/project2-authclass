But people like me who do make posts about disliking this mask society always get downvoted for some reason when I feel like it's not such a crazy thing to be dissastisfied with?\n\nI personally am not \"against masks\" at all and don't mind putting one on when I have to. They don't bother me so much. When I went back to visit in NYC omicron was spreading and I was the one reminding my family to put the mask on. My issue is how long this mask society is going to continue, and if it will ever end? I feel like there is a small chance they will become permanent in Japan (the way they are everywhere now, not how they were before covid). A few people have already told me they don't mind them anymore and this is the new normal. In that case it would be better for me to just leave than complain I guess.\n\nI like seeing people's faces outside, especially kids faces and even old folks. Now in the park even they have it on all the time even if they are spread apart from people. I don't see nothing wrong in wanting that normalcy to come back to this country again. Not saying you don't understand, just some people on here don't and if I say I wanna see people's faces outside I get annihilated with downvotes lol\n\nAlso maybe there is no concrete evidence that masks are \"harmful\", I have seen concerns by some scientists in Japan expressing doubts over how much we have them on. It's healthy for children to be exposed to dirt and bacteria and now they're being constantly sanitized and protected and its not a great thing I guess. Also facial expression/recognition is important and kids have less and less chance to see that outside of their immediate family.

That being said I had read his autobiography & the satanic bible thanks to a friend of mine who had recommended Manson and those books to me.

HIM? He's supposed to be MANSON. I didn't get it. I still don't love the album but appreciate it more now.\n\nI ended up buying THEOL, though, and I enjoyed it. At that point I had no friends who still liked Manson so I didn't have many people to gush about him with.
