If the previous letter doesn\u2019t pronounce the soft a, then the soft a is pronounced in this letter.\n\nLet me explain using \u0914\u0930\u0924 (aurat) - woman compared to \u0914\u0930\u0924\u0947\u0902 (aurtein) - women, and hopefully you can see why it\u2019s not auratein.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at aurat. The last letter, \u0924 doesn\u2019t have any strong vowel symbols, so it is just \u2018t.\u2019 Now we look at \u0930. Because there was no vowel sound on the previous letter, but also because \u0930 doesn\u2019t have any specific vowel symbol, we give it the default \u2018a\u2019 sound, which makes it \u2018ra.\u2019 Now we look at \u0914, which is a vowel so it is always pronounced consistently - \u2018au.\u2019 \n\nAu + ra + t -> aurat\n\nNow let\u2019s look at aurtein. The last letter is \u0924\u0947\u0902. Since it has symbols, we write it\u2019s value - \u2018tein.\u2019 Now we look at \u0930. Previously, the letter \u2018before\u2019 - technically after - didn\u2019t have a vowel sound. However, now, the previous letter DOES have a vowel sound. Because of this, IN ADDITION TO the fact that \u0930 doesn\u2019t have any vowel symbols, this time it just has a \u2018r\u2019 sound without the \u2018a.\u2019 And finally we can add the beginning, \u0914 which is \u2018au.\u2019\n\nAu + r + tein -> aurtein\n\nTo help you with one of your problems, one more example: \u091a\u092e\u091a\u092e - \u0107am\u0107am.\n\nFirst, the last \u092e. Since it is at the end with no additional symbols, it is just \u2018m.\u2019 Because \u092e doesn\u2019t have a vowel, we add the default \u2018a\u2019 to the next \u091a now, which makes \u2018\u0107a.\u2019 Now, we look at the second \u092e. This letter is \u2018behind\u2019 a letter where we DO pronounce the \u2018a\u2019 so the \u2018a\u2019 isn\u2019t added here - \u2018m.\u2019 And now the first letter is \u2018behind\u2019 a letter where we DON\u2019T pronounce the \u2018a\u2019 - so the \u2018a\u2019 IS added - \u2018\u0107a!\u2019\n\n\u0106a + m + \u0107a + m -> \u0107am\u0107am\n\nHope this helps, if you have any questions hopefully I can help :)", "created_utc": "1618598150.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gur5zq0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ms7ead", "parent_id": "t3_ms7ead", "score": "4", "subreddit": "Hindi", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj1t"}, {"author": "It_was_sayooooooj", "body": "Haha that\u2019s good news!
