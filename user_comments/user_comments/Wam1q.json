Again we're talking about law here, law \u2260 ethics. Islam has a different set of laws and a different set of ethics. Ethically, banks should be giving out what's known in Islamic terminology as Al-Qard Al-Hasan (non-interest-bearing loans with no \"fees\"). And we should all ethically be giving out a lot more in charity according to Islam, but it can't be held against you to not be giving charity (other than 2.5% of your yearly savings in Zakat which is mandatory for Muslims). Islam says that you will have to answer for your wealth and for not having spent it on such-and-such charitable cause on the day of Judgement, just not here.\n\n>While I might say that a mortgage helps you in owning a property and you might be right in this purer motive, there are Shari'a compliant personal loans which are not that pure, hence that's why I'm not convinced about Islamic products being better for a Muslim. But Islamic banking is way more complicated than this, and I'm pretty sure scholars found ways to justify the profits in a religious way.\n\nIslamically-inclined folks should not be discouraged from asset-backed Islamic loans (car, house) because they also give out cash loans with \"fees\". When you read into them, they are actually really smart, and there is an underlying asset changing ownership even with Islamic personal loans and Islamic credit cards.\n\nDifferent scholars find different things to be acceptable or not based on minutae of the deal and because of that, different Shariah boards approve different things and banks offer different products.\n\n>And by the way, I believe humanity should have landed on Mars a decade ago, personally I think it's time to move on from holy books.\n\nYou can at least realize and not be advising other Muslims that it is just a game of words when the Qur'an directly rebuked the Arabian polytheists for saying the same.

They said that God forbids interest, but not profit and that both are the same (the motive is to have gains). But God replies explicitly that one is Halal while the other is Haram in [Al-Baqarah 2:275](https://quran.com/2/275):\n\n> ^(275)Those who consume interest will stand \u02f9on Judgment Day\u02fa like those driven to madness by Satan\u2019s touch. That is because they say, \u201cTrade is no different than interest.\u201d But Allah has permitted trading and forbidden interest. Whoever refrains\u2014after having received warning from their Lord\u2014may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.\n\nThe motive to have gains isn't prohibited or villainized. Financial institutions can be for-profit like any other business, Islamically.\n\nIslam forbids renting out money. Shariah-compliant mortgages do not rent out money and there are differences which can affect the regular borrower in certain circumstances depending on the mechanics of the loan.\n\nIf the words of slaughter are not recited when slaughtering a cow, the beef from it becomes haram. It could have been halal had those words just been recited. You wouldn't buy cheaper haram beef rather than more expensive halal beef, would you?\n\nSimilarly, a relation between a man and a woman which would otherwise be haram becomes halal just by words. Just because zina is prohibited, you cannot extrapolate and say Islam is against sex. Similarly, the differences in the technicalities matter. The profit motive of the bank is not haram.

Hizam:\n> \"I asked Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), I said: 'A man came to me asking to buy something that I did not have. Can I buy it from the market for him and then give it to him?'

I think because it violates the general principle of honesty. The buyer might turn down another sale later and the dropshipper might not be able to fulfil the order leaving the buyer both out of money and the goods which they thought they purchased. The deal can be modified to make it fall under halal (permissible), i.e., by becoming an agent/broker, by establishing the supply chain beforehand, product specs and delivery time frame known beforehand, etc.\n\nThis is the basic summary.

They are a European invention. See how Japanese is still written without spaces between words.\n\nGiven the absence of spaces in Urdu, word boundaries were marked simply by turning the last letter of a word into its non-joining form (isolated/final form) if it wasn't a non-joining letter already, e.g.\n\n\u0645\u06cc\u06ba\u200c\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648\u067e\u0691\u06be\u200c\u0644\u06a9\u06be\u200c\u0633\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u06ba\u06d4\n\nThis is how sentences are handwritten.\n\nThe same was the case with Farsi. Words like be sharm (pronounced bi-sherm \u0628\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0631\u0645 in Iranian Farsi nowadays) have always been written with a non-joining ye. Urdu parses this as two words be (without) and sharm (shame). Farsi parses them as a single compound word (shameless) and they force the final ye form by using ZWNJ in modern typography.\n\nBe sharm in Urdu is still two words. Some typists even put in a space between be and sharm to reflect this. But since the Unicode character for bari ye happens to be non-joining, it is convenient to not put a space and it will render the type similar to handwriting anyway.\n\nYou are backforming words/spellings by how they're typed to how they must be parsed. Typing came later and typing had to fit the faulty Unicode encodings with the manuscripts/handwritten documents people already had.\n\n>Also, didn't you say that bari ye is a joining letter? Now you say it isn't? Well even if it doesn't (which is true), it would still be a joining letter because it joins at the end.\n\nI'm saying the Unicode encoding for bari ye is faulty. They must not have made it into a non-joining character. Choti ye only has two sounds, the long vowel i and the semi-consonant y. The other two sounds, long vowels ai and e are exclusively for bari ye, no matter where the sound occurs in the word. And the medial and initial forms of both ye's are supposed to look the same.\n\nE.g. prem is supposed to be parsed as pe+re+bari ye+mim even though we are forced to type it as pe+re+choti ye+mim for it to look correct.", "created_utc": "1655490212.0", "edited": "1655490816.0", "id": "icqre9d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_uuzutw", "parent_id": "t1_icqmilf", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Urdu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qun7"}, {"author": "Wam1q", "body": "Sahil means the coast in Arabic.

Nun ghunnah indicates that the previous vowel is nasal and that's it.\n\n>Additionally, what are the diacritic Rules With Nun Ghunnah which Are Different From Nun Tabi'ee( The Arabi Nun )?\n\nNun ghunnah doesn't take diacritics like zer, zabar, etc. It has only one function, to indicate a nasal vowel. A nasal vowel in Urdu occurs 90% of the time at the end of words, which the final/isolated form of the nun ghunnah (dotless nun) indicates perfectly well. The remaining 10% nasal vowels occurring before the end of the word when written look like a normal nun in most texts, so there you need to know the pronunciation beforehand, e.g. hansna \u06c1\u0646\u0633\u0646\u0627 (to laugh), here the first nun is a nun ghunnah which just indicates that the previous vowel 'a' is nasal.\n\nI would consider nun ghunnah to be good enough for the job. It helps you in the vast majority of cases (end of words) where it is a grammatical ending and context may not help, e.g. Woh ai \u0648\u06c1 \u0622\u0626\u06cc (she came) vs. Woh ain \u0648\u06c1 \u0622\u0626\u06cc\u06ba (they f. came).\n\nSimilar to bari ye. I consider it good enough for the job. It helps you in the minimal pair cases with choti ye where the kind of ye at the end of the word makes a grammatical difference and context may not help, e.g. Woh ai \u0648\u06c1 \u0622\u0626\u06cc (she came) vs. Woh ae \u0648\u06c1 \u0622\u0626\u06d2 (they came).\n\nTo summarise, both bari ye and nun ghunnah are good enough, because they differentiate the most common minimal pairs at the end of words. Because at the end of words, knowing this difference really matters when reading due to Urdu grammar. Actually, the letter wao does triple/quadruple duty with the sounds it has without any special forms, e.g., w, o, u, au. Why don't we have a special bara wao (for the sound 'o') with a special isolated/final form from some chota wao (with the sound 'u') like the difference between choti ye (for the sound 'i') and bari ye for the sound 'e'? Because Urdu grammar doesn't have suffixes where the only grammatical difference will be in the ending o/u. But the ending e/i or nasal vowel make a lot of difference.

Arabic, like other Semitic languages, has a system of consonantal roots and templates to form derivative morphology, e.g. matbakh (kitchen) from t-b-kh root (cook) and ma12a3 template (meaning place), maktab (office) from k-t-b (write). You cannot break it down into mat+bakh or mak+tab and assign a new meaning to it. Similarly, you cannot place khin (rotten) + ziri (apparent) to form khinzir (apparent rotten). The Arabic language doesn't work like English, Latin, Greek, etc.\n\nAlso ziri doesn't mean what is visible at all.

Similarly, qadam (a foot/literal step, Urdu plural: qadam, e.g. Ek qadam age barho \"Take a step forward\"/Do qadam piche jao \"Take two steps back\") - > iqdam (Arabic plural: steps - > a metaphorical step/action, e.g. Yeh hukumat ka acha iqdam hai \"This step by the government is good\") - > iqdamat (metaphorical steps/actions, e.g. hukumat ne ghurbat ke khatme ke liye kai iqdamat uthae \"The government took several steps to eliminate poverty\"). Finally, your example, hukum (a command, Urdu plural: hukum) - > ehkam (Arabic plural - > a state decree by a king/government) - > ehkamat (decrees).", "created_utc": "1633182211.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf3i9bq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzfxjq", "parent_id": "t1_hf0pz6n", "score": "3", "subreddit": "Urdu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qun7"}, {"author": "Wam1q", "body": "All masculine nouns in Urdu which are not marked as masculine by final -a have identical nominative singular and plural forms.\n\nE.g. seb (an apple/apples), dost (a friend/friends), ghar (a house/houses); but marked larka (a boy)  - > larke (boys), kona (a corner) - > kone (corners), kunwan (a well) - > kunwen (wells).", "created_utc": "1633180714.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hf3f9yy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_pzfxjq", "parent_id": "t3_pzfxjq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Urdu", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qun7"}, {"author": "Wam1q", "body": "You're welcome \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": "1625674778.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4da43p", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_offcb3", "parent_id": "t1_h4d8xbd", "score": "2", "subreddit": "abudhabi", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sm4e"}, {"author": "Wam1q", "body": "Abu Dubai?", "created_utc": "1625670658.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4d0quf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_offcb3", "parent_id": "t3_offcb3", "score": "2", "subreddit": "abudhabi", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sm4e"}, {"author": "Wam1q", "body": "Bangladesh was founded on an ethnic identity, whereas Pakistan was explicitly founded in the name of Islam.", "created_utc": "1625666786.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4csenc", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_odfzua", "parent_id": "t1_h44t58g", "score": "3", "subreddit": "islam", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbp"}, {"author": "Wam1q", "body": "I think Al Hilal Bank has a zero-balance savings account.
