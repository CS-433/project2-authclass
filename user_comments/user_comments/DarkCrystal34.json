Responding to your comments:\n\n**1.**  **Renaissance vs. Clockwork & Chivalry vs. Dark Streets** \\- I understand what you said about Renaissance is a general ruleset, but if that's already (I assume) in the \"Renaissance\" historical era, and Clockwork & Chivalry is applying it to 17th century (also the Renaissance)...isn't that the same era? Or are there other meaningful differences in the game?  Maybe they are doing it by century e.g.\n\n* Renaissance is 1600s\n* Clockwork & Chivalry is late 1600 - mid 1700s\n* Dark Streets is late 1700s\n\nAre the mechanics of \"how to play\" largely the same, but it's more tweaked in terms of skills, professions, items or magic to each era, or are there other major differences between the three?\n\n**2.**  **If I'm looking to play in Victorian era or earlier 19th century** (1800-1850 vibe...maybe a bit earlier to 1775'ish) - Would you say maybe Dark Street is the best bet?\n\n**3.  OpenQuest 3** \\- I'd *highly* recommend getting OpenQuest 3, rather than sticking with the 2nd ed.  I'm a newcomer to it, but now having checked out the PDFs to both 2e and 3e, 3e is sooooo much better organized, laid out, and structured.  It just has a real easeful intuitive flow and makes some mechanical updates + tweaks (also positive, and that add a bit more nuance), so much so I bought the hardback as well.\n\n**4.  Steampunk** \\- Right now I'm considering a possible fusion of:\n\n* Basic Roleplaying\n* OpenQuest 3\n* Delta Green (<--really love some of their mechanics)\n* (One of) the triplet of Renaissance / Clockwork & Chiv / Dark Streets\n\n...and kind of mashing them together in a d100 that fits what I'm trying to do, but trying to see which one makes most sense for the last bullet point\n\n**5.

So V5's system is not really Storyteller or Storytelling, it kind of integrates best of both worlds, in your opinion?  When you say resisted/contested actions, do you mean the system uses opposed roles in places you don't like, rather than just a TN?  \n\nAnd when you say simple target number, do you mean for the difficulty check, or for when players beat the difficulty check, there's not an ever changing \"well this check you need 2 successes and this you need 4\" which I have to say, sounds totally crazy to me not having played.  The idea of moving the difficulty slider around makes more sense to me than # of successes that is ever changing.\n\nThe hunger dice I do love, as I think it introduces an awesome level of tension for what I figure vampires would naturally face, I just assumed all the Vampire games had that, didn't know that was unique to V5.  \n\nDo you largely play in the setting of World of Darkness still, in your own version of CoD 2e, or have you moved onto other systems or setting locations?", "created_utc": "1657085183.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if1gj4b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vrvvgm", "parent_id": "t1_if0kt78", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "DarkCrystal34", "body": "This lol.", "created_utc": "1657083880.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if1ejl4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vsfmh6", "parent_id": "t1_if1chkz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "billsimmons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yb1h"}, {"author": "DarkCrystal34", "body": "**Spire/Heart -** What's the basic core resolution mechanic, if you don't mind sharing?

I'm talking about modern North American entertainment (TV, cinema), but this also extends into things like media, newspapers, and yes, TTRPGs, depictions inaccurately portraying a continent or people's as often uncivilized, savage, barbarians, overall tribal, non-modern, unintelligent, \"folk wisdom\" but no modern technology or universities, etc.  This has been studied academically and documented for years, I'm not making some crazy claim.\n\n**2.**  The modern slave trade fits in because, while it's true that stereotypes often are just natural to exist (our brain has to categorize information somehow), that also a spectrum of what's appropriate and responsible, and not, and historical context matters in this regard.\n\nAre there also unfair stereotypes of Scandinavians, as the poster above was saying?  Absolutely.  Not detracting from that.  There's harmful and unfair stereotypes of every country or culture.\n\nBut I'd certainly say that the intercontinental slave trade of an entire continent of people, and forthcoming political oppression of not just the U.S. but so much of Western Europe, *absolutely* brings an extra heaviness and weight to when media portrays Africa or South America with the typical overly barbaric, savage, warrior-like without intelligence, uncivilized, etc. etc.  \n\nPart of why that is doubly offensive is (1) the fact these repeated stereotypes exist to begin with, but certainly (2) it's like a slap in the face after a global atrocity was committed to a people, because the media we're talking about is *coming from the very former countries who committed these horrible acts.*  So, yes, **the enslavement of a people followed by depictions** ***from the country that enslaved them*** **continuing to show the** ***very same people's culture and heritage*** **as unintelligent and uncivilized**...is, in fact, tied together.  IMHO.\n\n**3.**  If you honestly think there isn't a long history of media, let alone media misrepresentation of different cultures, I say this with all due respect, because I can tell you're obviously intelligent and trying to make good points and have a debate, but I really think you need to read more up on it.  Honestly, this is a really widely researched and studied aspect of media, so my sense is if you think the media does not have a long history, maybe you're either referring of only television or internet, which of course is modern era of media, but the subject of racist categories of media misrepresentation goes back to the eras of Ancient Rome when they settled/colonized Africa and would send back literature and reports of what they saw there, and it's a direct parallel to the same stereotypes as now that we're still grappling with.\n\nSo this has been in media of various points in history, books that were made famous, etc in terms of how information has been disseminated, for literally hundreds of years, *far* before even the more modern slave trade, in terms of European and African + Middle Eastern relations and media.", "created_utc": "1656182596.0", "edited": "1656191413.0", "id": "idptbsx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vk5hze", "parent_id": "t1_idpkw0k", "score": "2", "subreddit": "rpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s"}, {"author": "DarkCrystal34", "body": "You lost me with \"NCO\" not sure what that's an acronym for?  :-)\n\nReally appreciate the post though, this is ultra helpful!", "created_utc": "1656181709.0", "edited": "False", "id": "idpresf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vc7wsx", "parent_id": "t1_idpqr4g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "FATErpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2toez"}, {"author": "DarkCrystal34", "body": "It's awesome!

I think many people enjoy 70-80% of systems, and then heavily modify the things they don't like about it to suit their storytelling needs.  To me that's not \"not engaging the game on their premise\", but rather taking the same liberties most game tables take with a system.\n\nBut that's also a personal preference thing, so while a table or AP doing that may not be your cup 'o tea, many others are fine with and ok with that, IMO. My bias and preference is that I am in service to the story, the comfort level of players, and the emotional experience of storytelling, *always* more than the system.  Many people agree with that, and many people don't and enjoy doing system 100% to a tee more.  Both are correct!  So I respect what you are sharing, but I do love the OSR \"rulings over rules\" mindset.\n\n**Beyond D&D** \\- I see your pun and upvote it! lol\n\n**FATE e.g.** \\- I mostly agree with you, but what I'm vaguely interested in is for people who have moved past D&D, I think we could agree that *some* (not all) people *do* have specific tastes or preferences to hear a system played in AP form, that they might prefer one over another.  Right now I've heard a ton of Blades in the Dark podcasts, have zero interest in Cypher, have a good grasp on SofDL, so a Fate or Savage Worlds I'd pick in a vaccume, as two other podcasts I enjoy are Genesys so feel satiated there.\n\n**System fit** \\- My post isn't seeking advice on which system fits best, I'll be learning that through experience, intuition, and group consensus.

Obviously Ross crushes everything he does, but Noura's play style has really grown on me.

I hope it improves but his character feels really one note, and he seems to want to only crack jokes, which checks me out, as I prefer the blend of drama and comedy.  \n\nTo me the brilliance of OG GCP crew is how seamlessly they weave in and out of real drama and comedy, but as silly as they get they quickly can return to taking characters seriously with real care.  \n\nI sense that with Ross/Noura but less so with Kate/Rob.
