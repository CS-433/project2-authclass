Like where a soldier learns infantry tactics and training, but without  a full loadout? Or where a soldier specializes in MOUT and only trains CQB? From what I understand, I understand the US Marine Corps kind of does this with MOS 8152, Security Force, where Marines go after 0311 training at School of Infantry. They learn more CQB tactics than a regular Infantry Marine and get stationed at a dedicated FAST company.\n\nI'm asking because I have been pondering Ukraine, but things like the Iraqi and Afghan insurgencies, and the Chechen war in the past as well.\n\nIn Iraq and Afghan, what was the loadout of Mahdi militia member? Did the average Taliban carry over 100 pounds of gear, like British soldiers did(King,2017)? Probably their weapon, ammo, and some explosives. They didn't need a rucksack because their bed was at home, as was their food. They were highly mobile fighters who knew the terrain like the back of their hands because they lived there for many years.\n\nSuch an instance be used to train purely defensive units on urban combat fundamentals, while ignoring things like rucking and maybe land navigation in forests if those units aren't going to be used in such a way anyways? In case of an upcoming war like what happened with Ukraine this year, many civilians were hastily trained and thrown into territorial defense units.\n\nBut why does this need to be the case? In peacetime, cutting non-urban warfare things and training only on urban warfare/MOUT, wouldn't that make units experts in that type of warfare and more skilled than \"regular\" enemy infantry units that have to split their time focusing on other types of environments/training?\n\nAbout the training without a loadout, the problem I have identified is the issue of women in combat and their injuries. Women get injured more than men in frontline combat roles like infantry during things like rucking and foot marches(Army, 2021), which are absolutely infantry necessary tasks. I understand the physical differences are one of the main reasons women were kept out of frontline roles in the US for a long time.\n\nMaybe this is me being a sexist idiot, but wouldn't putting women in defensive infantry kind of eliminate this problem? Train women without a 60lb ruck, and the injuries will disappear. You will give them good training to do shooty stuff well, free up more men to do offensive operations, and you as the government don't need to pay their disability as they won't get injured as much. \n\nSorry if this is me rambling while asking a question, but I have always wondered this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReference:\n\nKing, J.

Same with offering them citizenship, as many obviously view US citizenship as an extremely attractive thing. I mean, take a look at how many people risk their lives to cross illegally into the US.

The SS had a mixed bag of performance, but some of them fought really tenaciously. Units like the 5th SS Wiking and 33rd SS French are some of these units that have performed well, especially the 33rd as many fought to the end in Berlin. Obviously, many surrendered and some even turned their weapons on their German allies, so it really is a mixed bag.\n\nFor ISIS, many of the foreign fighters were more extremist than the native Iraqis/Syrians, as they actively chose to come for Jihad.

So it fight or die where native Arabs could slip away undetected or surrender and claim to be conscripted.\n\nAlso, you don't need to put foreigners in the front lines where they may defect.  Ditches still need to be dug, areas policed, prisoners guarded, and food cooked.\n\nSo the lesson may be to put foreign fighters in the rear or easier sectors, or put them against an enemy where the only choices are fight or die(i.e, don't put ethnic Soviets on the Western Front where they have no incentive to fight.

(Definitely should stay within SF's scope)  \nDIRECT ACTION  \nSeize, capture, recover, or destroy enemy material, or recover personnel with quick strikes. (Sounds like a job for the 75th or Delta)  \nFOREIGN INTERNAL DEFENSE  \nTrain and equip foreign allied military forces to defend against insurgency, subversion, terrorism, and other security threats. (Maybe that new SFAB the Army is standing up?)  \nSPECIAL RECONNAISSANCE  \nConduct surveillance in hostile, denied, or diplomatically or politically sensitive environments, to collect or verify information of strategic significance. (Stay within SF)  \nSECURITY FORCE ASSISTANCE  \nTrain and develop the defense capabilities of friendly and developing nations. (SFAB)\n\nI feel like you don't need SF to build up an Army if you can put down complete training infrastructure around. In Iraq, didn't you have regular infantry guys teaching Iraqi Army/Police guys to do jumping jacks with hilarious and sad effects.

No, he has the chow hall. Does Sgt. First class buy some pirated dvds from Walid, the guy who runs a counterfeit store that sell dvds? No, he can get it sent through Amazon.

It is a new recruitment scheme that the Indian government rolled out, but it is very controversial and has caused protests in several cities, with trains being burnt and stuff.\n\nThe new Agnipath scheme is aimed at people aged between 17.5 and 21 years. It says that successful candidates will join the armed services for four years, after which only 25% of them will be retained.(BBC) After the first contract, those retained will be offered 15 year contracts like the old system.\n\nThis is in departure to the old system, where people were hired for 15 years. In India, police and military jobs are seen as a way out of poverty, a bedrock of social stability, and a regular income. As such, they are extremely hard to get, with people studying for those roles.\n\nI can understand why people would be upset about the age cutoff of 17.5 to 21, as it screws over those who are currently over 21 and can't enter the military in other ways. Under the new system, people that leave after 4 years will given a lump sum and that is it. Indian Army retirement is very generous with 50% pay for the rest of your life(similar to the US), so applicants may see Agnipath as a barrier to that, given that only 25% will be retained after their first term.\n\nBut I think that the program is good in general, from a defense perspective. It prevents stagnation(which would benefit applicants, as there are always people separating at the end of 4 years, leaving a spot open for new applicants), allows flexibility for the military to get rid of mediocre performers(I understand this is an issue with their civil service, where it is very hard to get rid of civil servants, though I am not sure if this principle also applies to military as well), ideally allows the best performers to get retained(only 25% of Agnipath people will be retained, so they are truly the best or just the best at playing the political game), and creates a large pool of experienced veterans in case of national emergencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?

Most of the instances were related to child soldiers, such as Flakhelfers/12th SS HitlerJugend Division in WW2, student soldiers in Korea, and military academies for high schoolers in the USSR/Russia.  Especially for Russia, I understand that regular students have classes where they take AKs apart.\n\nSo, just as a thought and kind of a question as well, but does providing military training to kids(really teenagers) outside of school hours(or even as part of school itself) enhance combat effectiveness in case of a long-term war?\n\nTaking a look at the 12th SS Hitlerjugend Division again, most soldiers there in 1944 were 17 to 18 year olds of the Hitler Youth, led by adult NCOs and officers who were vets of other fronts. They have been through maybe 12 or so years of the Nazi education and were indoctrinated and fanatical. The Hitler Youth also did military-type in general, through their weekly meetings. However, their fanaticism  sucked in the face of superior training and experience by the allies, who were fighting for years at that point.\n\nThought experiment, where you take that 13 year old kid in 1941, and give him a few hours of training before and after school throughout the week. Would that make him a better soldier? I would wager yes.\n\nI mean, thinking back when I was a teen, I had a lot of free time. Wake up at 8, school at 9, finish at 4, homework+dinner+gaming+tv, until 11 or so. \n\nTaking a 1941 German version of me, if I add military training, I would schedule it like this.\n\n0600-2 hours of physical fitness/military stuff. Marching, customs/courtesy, pt.\n\n0800 to 1400- Regular school stuff.\n\n1400 to 1700- Small unit tactics and weapons training.\n\n1700 to 1800- Ideological training.\n\nYou could cut down on the homework, and they definitely had less time for gaming. Do this would add about 6 hours a day, or 30 hours a week, not including weekends. Doing this during the school year, assuming Sept-May(36 weeks of so) will give around 1100 hours of military training. Done for 3 years results in 3300 hours of training within the body of a 17 year old.\n\nDoing this mitigates the issue of sending poorly-trained kids to fight as these kids technically have thousands of hours doing military stuff and should ideally perform pretty well.

Having the Warsaw Pact back in the Cold War meant the West had to push through a lot more of Eastern Europe before reaching Russia proper.\n\nNorth Korea is a buffer from having US troops right on the Yalu River.\n\nFor all those saying that  Russia and China want to subjugate their neighbors does have an element of truth as well. But the U.S. invading is never out of the question if/when ABM becomes a lot better. \n\nAnd more importantly, things can change rapidly, and may lead to an invasion that we think is impossible today. Did Saddam think that the US would invade him in 2003? Did the Chinese think the Japanese would invade them in 1910?

That is probably the best case scenario, along with sanctions ending.\n\nUkraine's best win would be the pre-2014 borders but that will never happen. I think recognition of DPR, LPR and Crimea as Russian would be the best that they can do with their military situation, as they cant hope to take them back, but can exchange recognition of them for the Russians leaving permanently and a treaty settling this issues.\n\nI think Ukraine to the EU and NATO is a bit premature now though. Everyone is hyped up now so they are overlooking some of the issues Ukraine has that would otherwise prevent EU membership. I am not read up on the process of EU integration, but I understand that Ukraine has issues with LGBT and some corruption issues, which may factor into a hesitancy to admit Ukraine after all the fervor dies down .\n\nHmm, what if a deal like this is reached, which is obviously highly unlikely. \n-Russia gets everything east of the Dnieper as an \"independent\" state like DPR and LPR, recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and guaranteed water for Crimea. Sanctions gradually get repealed. Putin keeps his naval base and gets a natural barrier from the EU and NATO.\n\n-The remaining parts of Ukraine are immediately placed into EU and NATO, with the capital based out of Lviv. Russia may not try its shenanigans again if Ukraine is part of the EU/NATO. This will satisfy Ukraine's desire for protection from Russia while leaving Putin with his natural barrier and Crimea.\n\nObviously the Ukrainians lose massively in this deal, but depending on the battlefield situation, this may be a way to prevent the Russians from completely taking over Ukraine(not that I think that they want to).", "created_utc": "1646280886.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hz547zy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_t5e6mi", "parent_id": "t1_hz50u3g", "score": "2", "subreddit": "LessCredibleDefence", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yyyd"}, {"author": "OkayestUsername420", "body": "I think that peace will ultimately win out in Russia's favor.

Taking his words at face value of \"Denazifying\" and \"Demilitarizing\" Ukraine can be taken as win conditions if he solidifies territorial gains or international recognition of LPR, DPR, and a land bridge to Crimea with guaranteed water rights.\n\nI dont think he actually intends to hold all of ukraine at the start, likely seeking to make gains in order to have an extremely strong position at the bargaining table. However, the sanctions will start to hurt Putin's position and the west and Ukraine knows this.\n\nThere is no way Ukraine would ever be able to get back the places mentioned above, and Ukrainian nationalism is running high, so there will be a lot of pressure on Zelensky to not take a deal that gives up territory.
