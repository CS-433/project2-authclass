A few hours of a tv show (but that was a minor part of the time).\n\nYour first problem: You are not using the right tools. \n\nDon't get me wrong but Assimil, while it is excellent in some ways, is not designed for the CEFR system (which is very often its advantage), and most people agree it actually leads to B1, definitely not B2, and it doesn't give you enough exercises. \n\nYou've been memorising a lot of vocab, which is great, but the key to getting through the earlier levels of a language, especially a language like German, is grammar. Grammar is the necessary condition for using your vocabulary, for speaking and writing.\n\nYou seem to be doing very well on the receptive skills side, with your graded readers and similar stuff. But the productive skills are simply unlikely to develop fast, without a very solid grammar base.\n\nAlso, memorising sentences is not that great imho. Did you at least memorise them as close deletions? You need to train your skills to put a sentence together. And now that you are switching just to recognition cards, you are making it easier but less efficient. I am not say useless, not at all, it just misses some pieces.\n\nThe key to my success was finally getting comfortable with the basic german grammar up to B1, then vocabulary. B2 is really about using the stuff from A1-B1 more creatively and in a richer way, with more vocab, and with significantly fewer mistakes. \n\nIf you want fast progress, I recommend the A-Grammatik and B-Grammatik  published by Schubert, those will teach you very well all the grammar Assimil has scratched. A really cefr oriented coursebook like DaF kompakt or better (but longer) path through Begegnungen.\n\nDo all your activities as actively as possible. Complete the exercises out loud and in writing. Rewrite a sentence you've made a mistake in. Repeat a lot after the audio (btw Assimil audio and the dialogue content is one of the best on the market and well worth working with for hours!), use audio as dictation, and so on. Expand on your exercises by substituting words with other known vocab, with using the various features together, and so on.

I am simply trying to give back a bit of the best I got from online language communities, when I needed. I hope OP will find a path that will fit them well.\n\nAs to your question: I'd recommend approaching grammar not as a binary choice \"I know this\" vs \"I don't know this\". It is more like a pile of layers. You learn the basics, you understand the theory, then you add a layer of exercises, than a layer of input, then a layer of more detailed expalanations from a bit more advanced book, and so on. At some point, you can climb (or crawl) over these steps towards the goal. You'll be precise and correct more and more often.\n\nI think all of us need a mix of activities. If you struggle in this way, then you are probably missing something, and nobody else can guess what without much more info. \n\nIn general, I'd recommend getting harder exercises and tons of input. You can make your exercises harder yourself. You did ok in the exercise on pronouns in the present tense? Cool, now do it in the past tense. And now swith it all to plural or vice versa. Now change the vocabulary a bit. Now make five more similar examples on your own. And so on.\n\nMost exercises can really be adapted in various ways. Also, I recommend tons of input to help with automatisation and getting used to the features.

It's normal to have to learn a language you don't like and don't find easy at all. I used to hate English. I even used to hate German. And look at me now, English at solid C1 (some skills definitely C2), and getting my German to C1 in spite of that. In both cases, I've learnt them either out of necessity, or for very big benefits and options. In was not fun. German is now starting to be \"fun\", because I like the success.\n\nWhy am I telling you. Language learning communities may give the impression that everybody loves the languages they learn. That it is all about choices and having fun, and  enjoying the process. The reality is quite the opposite. You were one of the lucky ones, if you actually enjoyed learning your first obligatory language. But now, you are not. **We simply don't get to study only what we like.**\n\nAlso, you don't tell us much about how you've been learning, so I'll just make assumptions based on over twenty years of language learning experience under various types of conditions: You've been learning in a classroom with an average (or worse) teacher and with at least 10 (more usually 15) average classmates, with one of the not well structured coursebooks (unfortunately, the French coursebooks seem to be often worse than Spanish ones, in my opinion, probably to make you buy extra books), not doing much extra work, definitely not extra grammar work, you've just been trying the bare minimum and feeling frustrated by the bad results.\n\nYou have several logical options:\n\n1.Try to switch languages. This may not be possible. IF it is possible, go for it. Get out of your hell.\n\n2.Try to find something to like about French. That has been one half of my English success. I don't like the language even now that I am good at it. But I've learnt to love the tons of books, tv shows, music, etc. The same can be true about French for you. French is one of the hugest languages on earth when it comes to culture, entertainment, education, and science. There is a high chance, that you might learn to love that.\n\n3.If 2 is not possible, you can love your success. You can love the pride of every tiny accomplishment. You can take it as an intellectual challenge. That's what I am starting to love about German. At first, I was learning it just to find job opportunities, but then I started liking bits of success. And it has changed with my successful B2 exam. Nowadays, I like that I am getting good at it, even though I'll probably never like 99,9% of German culture. You can be stubborn enough and learn French just to succeed at it. After all, you probably don't like all your other subjects either, but need them for your degree.\n\nNow, if you go with option 2 or 3:\n\n\\-evaluate your learning resources. Are you capable of relearning French from them? Either restudy the books used in class, or get better ones. If your classes are using CEFR labeled books, it is great, you can pick any resource for the level and it should get you there. One of the many good options is \u00c9dito, but there are many more on the market\n\n\\-Whatever series of books you use, you can add the Progressive books to that (especially Grammaire, Vocabulaire, and Communication). They are the best on the market, and they are excellent exactly for people who are not exactly beginners, but have very uneven level in various areas, and tons of gaps. Start from the d\u00e9butant level and restudy everything. Such books offer much more freedom than most digital tools btw, you can pick the lessons, the order in which to do them (which would be highly useful for catching up with your class), and whether to do them fast or slow or more times (depends on how familiar you are with the content)\n\n\\-if you like digital tools, Kwiziq is excellent, and perhaps Speakly or Anki for vocabulary (or any SRS). You cannot succeed without learning grammar and vocab well. The fun parts, such as movies and books, start mostly at B1 or even B2.\n\nBut don't spread yourself too thin, do max. two or three resources at once, not a dozen.\n\n\\-learn actively. Don't just dumbly read your resources, don't just reread lists. Read stuff out loud and retell it or comment on it. Do the exercises out loud AND in writing. Rewrite correctly a sentence you've made a mistake in and say it out loud. Repeat after the audio, or use it as a dictation exercise. Enrich any exercise with a few simple vocab substitutions, to get the pattern in your head. imagine funny examples for the vocabulary. And so on. Don't expect the content of the book to magically get inside the head and ready for use just through reading it once or twice.\n\nChop your huge task into many tiny ones and be proud of every tiny accomplishment. You finished unit 5? Awesome, you rock! You got through 50 anki reviews? You are so cool! You did the grammar workbook page with only three mistakes, while the previous one had five? Wow, you're really improving! \n\nYou need to break the chain of failures. You will not be great at French in a week. Nope. But you can be a bit better every week.

I had given up and prefer self study for this reason. I might change that in future as I know much better what to task for now, so my advice is based on experience :\n\n\\-if you are doing any input watching or listening with her during the lesson, she is wasting her money. She can (and should!) do a ton of such activities on their own. It saves a lot of expensive time to give that as homework and then do really meaningful stuff in the class. Typically: read the newspaper analysis article at home, discuss it in class with lots of speaking feedback.\n\n\\-why are so many people convinced learners should just listen to\"snippets\"? The key to my success in my advanced languages has been the opposite. Tons of reading, tons of listening. Stuff that is challenging. Snippets are nice, but make sure the student also does the more important part of reading and listening: longer stuff, thousands of pages of books, hundreds of hours of tv shows or other stuff (heated tv or radio discussions are a nice challenge). \n\n\\-it is totally possible she's not satisfied. Correcting \"here and there\" and \"a few things for delayed correction\", that doesn't sound good enough. Is she really near perfect, does she really make mistakes only \"here and there\"? Most teachers at the high levels are by far not strict enough. Or perhaps not hard working enough. She is paying you to be corrected and really improve. I've even seen a study (nope, haven't kept the link unfortunately) showing some of the main problems of advanced students. The teachers have no clue where the ceiling is and wrongly assume the student is good enough. They don't really push them hard and don't correct, because they don't believe in the real success of the student. Perhaps your student feels the same problem happening?\n\n\\-The vocab: what is she doing with it then? If she doesn't know it already, introduce her to Anki, or to any other technique on vocab learning. Many students just don't know any better than to write stuff down and perhaps reread it a few times, which is not really efficient. You are a learner too, give her advice on what to do outside of the lessons.\n\n\\-The pronunciation practice is great. How do you do shadowing? The real shadowing that Prof. Arguelles presents?  Or do you do normal repeating after? I do the second one and find it better (which is a matter of opinion). But nevertheless, do you correct her enough, is she very good or improving?\n\n**What you can and should offer:**\n\n\\-tons of speaking with tons of feedback. Challenging topics and situations, fitting the C1/C2 level. If you don't know, get inspired by the CAE and CPE preparatory books. Push her to not just calmly talk about a textbookish topic, go into a discussion, make her defend a stance, form good arguments. Go even through some \"basic situations\" going wrong, that's actually a totally untaught area that happens in the real life all the time. \n\n\\-tons of feedback to writing homework. Writing is a seriously underestimated skill. I suspect most teachers are just too lazy for it. But it does pays off enormously.\n\n\\-guidance on self study in between the lesson.

Such workbooks (or good digital alternatives like Kwiziq) fill a gap that I really find important in the digital courses.\n\nAnki is great, the only thing I was \"criticising\" was the content that you had told us nothing about. Anki is great, if you use it to learn enough stuff, and the right stuff. It can also be used pretty dumbly, it always depends on us.\n\nYes, speaking practice is great.

It is a toy meant to generate income by making you progress as slowly as possible, so that you see as many ads as possible.\n\nSpeaking Spanish with others is great as practice! In order to practice something, you need to learn it first. You learn from context, sure, but very slowly, and most people just talking without studying don't get to a too good level (for example lots and lots of immigrants).\n\nAnki is wonderful. But it can teach you only what you choose to be taught. Either you need to put in your own content, or you need to get a good enough deck. But in any case, it is just a supplemental tool.\n\nHow to get to A1/A2 to B1 in 3 months or less (I did this in 2014. And C1 passive skills):\n\n\\-you are not starting from zero, so grab monolingual resources that don't beat around the bush. I wholeheartedly recommend the workbooks by Anaya, especially Gramatica and Vocabulario. Also the Gramatica de uso del espanol. These tools are wonderful and highly efficient. You can even improve that, if you put the vocab to Anki\n\n\\-one normal coursebook series. The monolingual ones used in better language schools. I like Metodo, but very popular ones are for example Gente or Aula. There are also coursebooks meant for intensive study, I think one is called Via rapida, and I considered it at one point.\n\nIf you want B1, you need tools designed to get you to B1. Not stupid toy apps, not coursebooks defining their level in a different manner.\n\n\\-You might start now or a bit later with normal input. If not normal, than graded readers and podcasts. But soon audiobooks, websites, tv shows. But don't let it take too much of your time, the first two parts are much more important at the lower levels. I was watching a lot of tv shows and it helped enormously. But it would have been worthless without the good knowledge base from coursebooks and workbooks.\n\n\\-If you want to take an exam, I recommend getting one preparatory book and completing all the activities. I haven't taken a Spanish one yet, but I do overall recommend this based on my experience from exams in other languages.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1664826886.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iqxcc4q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xut095", "parent_id": "t3_xut095", "score": "90", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "There isn't much totally new grammar to learn, the jump from A2 to B1 is much bigger than from B1 and B2 as far as \"new grammar\" is concerned. However, you are supposed to use the grammar much better at B2 and make significantly fewer basic mistakes. B2 is the first level, where it starts being not just about getting a message across, but also about how you say or write stuff.\n\nWhatever you do, I recommend getting through a few grammar workbooks, as your description of your skills really screams \"more exercises!\" to me. For example A-Grammatik and B-Grammatik published by Schubert are excellent, but there are various good options on the market.\n\nIn general, I don't recommend signing for classes, they are the worst way to learn a language. The main problem are the classmates, those are your main obstacle. Others are a usually very slow pace, focus on stuff easily doable on your own instead of the stuff actually useful with a (good) teacher, and lack of focus on individual needs and problems.\n\nBut if you sign up for it, keep self-teaching as well, grammar requires tons of exposure (you are getting that) and also a lot of practice. Reviewing and extending your knowledge, reading more explanations, many more examples, and doing many more exercises, that's a wonderful step towards using the grammar right in the real life.\n\n**If you really want the class, go for B2.1, don't choose a lower level with worse classmates. They would damage your progress by exposing you to worse speech, and the lower level would also demotivate you from really putting in efforts.**\n\nJust a note: I passed Goethe B2 this year. And grammar exercise books were a large part of the success. I had gotten from rusty A1 to certified B2 in five and half months. Without a teacher or a class. Coursebooks, audio (and a bit of tv shows), grammar books, a bit of srs (not enough). And time and energy. That's my recipe. Could someone do better and get overall stronger skills, with also adding speaking practice? Sure, my approach definitely leaves space for improvement (which I am working on right now).

You are actually doing much more speaking then I had, so I wouldn't worry much about any limits caused by your physical location. :-)\n\n2.Yes, you are underperforming in the real life, that's pretty normal. I was just experiencing the same thing lately in two of my languages. It is normal as various factors come into play. The situations are less predictable, in some ways harder (you don't get used to the other speaker like in your conversation lessons, you have a few seconds of interaction and you either get some use of it, or fail), you are under more pressure (especially self-imposed!). It's ok. Stressing out about it won't help. Even if you fail to get the message across, or you feel bad about the quality of your speech, it is not the end of the world, none of these situations is a great representant of all of your ability in the language, and none of them predicts the next thousand outcomes.\n\n3.Practice may be important, but people underestimate preparation all the time! They often make it look as if nothing mattered, except for practice and practice. A well prepared overall C1 learner will be a totally different speaker after a week than an A2 learner will be in a year of practice without further studying. The better prepared you arrive, the better will your \"learning curve\" be in the country. How to prepare: Get to an overall good level, the higher the better. Work on good pronunciation, very solid grammar (so often underestimated, but the key to not sounding like a total moron), good enough vocabulary. From B1 on, get tons of listening from tv shows and similar sources, it's the best preparation for the real life interactions!\n\n4.Identification of your problems: I think you might be doing a rather typical mistake (which even coursebooks and schools are somewhat pushing people towards). You practice a lot of stuff but either haven't learnt or reviewed the \"boring\" basics. The basics (exactly the normal and natural ways to ask stuff you mention) need to be reviewed, a new layer of knowledge based on much more experience. Tv shows are one of the best ways to learn this. Some types of literature (especially of the \"lower\" genres).  \n\nI hope some of this might be useful to you. Just don't give up.

Is she just not using another language during the lesson, or is she actively against you using another language? \n\nIf it is just the first, just open a dictionary during the lesson. Easy. If not, then discuss, whether she is a good teacher for you. \n\nWhat self study in between the lessons is expected from you? If a lot of activities, a coursebook, grammar drills, vocab study, listening, etc, then using some English (or Spanish) will be inevitable. If she is against your self study, then she is just in a clash of interests, trying to keep you getting her lessons (=keep you incompetent and a very slow learner) for as long as possible, and she should of course be abandoned.\n\nI don't think tutors are too useful for beginners in most cases. And this sort of misunderstandings is one of the main reasons. But if you want to use her, establish very clearly your priorities, and focus on lots of self study before each lesson.

This doesn't apply much to language schools, but totally does apply to online platforms. If a teacher cannot be bothered to reply to a student, who has signed up for a class and sent a message with needs, info, etc, it is a very bad sign\n\n\\-generic profiles on teaching platforms. Really, regurgitating the same few sentences without giving any real info, that is not a good sign.\n\n\\-trying to fit you into their mold, even if your goals and personality don't fit that at all. Especially if you discuss one approach before signing up, and then they change it\n\n\\-not correcting you enough. If they are too \"nice\" and let mistakes slide, they are worthless. You pay to improve. It is often meant nicely, to encourage you. Or it is also ignorance. Even research shows, that one of the challenges at the intermediate and advanced levels is actually finding a teacher willing to push you to your real limits, not to their limited idea of what is possible for a foreigner. \n\n\\-Lying about their experience. Typically: \"I've prepared many people for various exams including this\" and then you find out you're their first guinea pig for this exam in particular\n\n\\-Making you waste time on stuff you can easily do in self study. Why pay for listening practice, reading practice, grammar drills? \n\n\\-incompetence in answering questions. It is surprising how many people struggle with understanding questions and answering them really as they are meant\n\n\\-being chaotic and disorganised. Most teachers these days try to be creative at all costs, they hate textbooks, flood you with a bunch of copies from various sources.

If you complete for example an A2 coursebook in the next few weeks, you will already be much more functional in the easy everyday situations. And capable of reliably asking the native to slow down, and then really understanding them. By the time you are B2, you will be ok. When that happens, depends primarily on how much time you spend with a good coursebook with audio. \n\n4.Around B1, start adding lots of media. Books are good but not sufficient. Tv, cinema, etc. Just normal everyday encounters may not be enough and they would make your progress dependent on other people, which is always a problem.

What kinds of jobs do you want? You don't need C2 for vast majority of jobs. Yes, C2 was extremely useful to me, because my first job abroad was being a psychiatrist, but that is a rather extreme example. C1 is enough for pretty much anything. But if you are aiming for one of the jobs, in which C2 might be a huge advantage, then more factors than just the language will be in play.\n2. You don't need a C2 course online or offline, you don't really need a teacher. Actually, the only language will a well developed C2 teaching market is English. In the others, schools/tutors usually refuse you, claim C2 impossible, or lie about their teaching experience. But that doesn't change much. In all three, you can get all the necessary resources to succeed, it is not an issue. Tons of normal input, some grammarbooks/coursebooks, practice test books etc. All three have that.\n3. Your personal interest counts a lot at this level. It will make it much easier to sink the necessary hundreds of hours in it. Because that's what C2 is about. It is not just about some amount of knowledge, it is mostly about experience, about being comfortable with the language, and ready for the unexpected. That takes time.\n\nSo, my advice based on your post:\n\n1. research not just the language requirements, but the whole skillset needed for the careers that you consider.\n2. If you really want to broaden your career opportunities, get them all to C1 (unless you are in a field requiring much less, such as most tourism related positions. But in that case, you wouldn't have written this post, I suppose). And one to C2. And take a normal official exam in each of them! Even if it is not specificially required, it still makes a much better impression on the CV that some subjective claims (especially as the employers are used to most people lying about their language skills).\n3. Get Italian to C2, if you love it the most. Not everything is just about your career, the opportunities may come secondarily. But C2 and the path to it can be very rewarding on the personal level, and help you develop more universal skills too. C1 French is impressive enough for vast majority of people and companies (even universities).\n4. But don't forget that the language is not everything, your language skills need to be put together with other qualifications and skills. Don't underestimate that. You can build a career even with a much smaller language, you just need to get more pieces of the puzzle together and fill a niche.Or you can learn a huge and very demanded language, but just struggle in the competition due to huge offer.

Not in the areas that matter at work. They didn't go to school in that language, they may not have qualified work experience in it. A normal C1 or C2 learner can definitely compete against  them in the professional situations.\n\n2.The first generation (and sometimes even second, unfortunately) very often sucks at the language of their new country. It depends on a lot of things, but many of the people I were in contact with had extremely low skills. So nope, not a competition, unless the job requires nothing else than their language. Most jobs require the language of the country the job is happening in. If your hypothetical Turkish competitor speaks A2ish and barely understandable German, they are rarely a competition for you.\n\n3.For most jobs, other qualifications play a huge role. So, perhaps don't regard learning the language just as a way to win, but rather a way to level the field.\n\nWith your example of a German employer in need of a bilingual Turkish/German speaker: That employer most probably needs a bilingual well educated in both, and also with a degree/experience in something else. It's very often not just a translating job, it's often a job in a mixed working team, or with clients speaking the language. So yes, basics of Turkish will not suffice. But if you get to C1 Turkish, are native of German, also know English, AND have the other qualification and experience, you could definitely win over a 2nd generation Turkish immigrant. It won't be just the language, what will decide.\n\nGet to C1 or C2 Turkish, prove it with a formal certificate, and then add other value to the CV. Of course, Turkish is just an example. But it is universaly valid imho, with one huge exception: langauges with few resources.

It has nothing to do with languages being more or less different. The main reasons:\n\n\\-people don't even try because they don't think it possible. Even language teachers, schools, and resource makers are to blame for this myth and self fulfilling prophecy. You can see English C2 label on some resources, some classes, etc. Good luck trying to find the same for French learners. C2 resources are rare, rather new, and still most teachers will tell you how impossible it is to reach the level. And that's still one of the biggest languages! And much easier for a european than Mandarin or Japanese. Various mainstream channels are now marketing Japanese/Mandarin and similar languages. But how many do actually suggest you could succeed and get to a very high level?\n\n\\-a closely tied point: the amount of advanced resources. Yes, there are now tons of Mandarin and Japanese resources on the market. But just like in the other languages, vast majority is for beginners, and many are very bad. When I was seriously considering Japanese or Mandarin, I could clearly see the path through the beginner phase. But it ended somewhere in the intermediate phase, with very little clarity on how to progress next. When it comes to English, even the people too \"lazy\" (for a lack of a better word) to look for their own path can just grab a series of coursebooks and sit in a class from A1 to C2. (Now I am not trying ot argue that such an attitude is the right one etc, but it is possible and people do it all the time)\n\n\\-lack of motivation: people are forced to learn English, and punished for failing by the society (English is now demanded on CV even for jobs not needing it at all, it is often just an easy way to throw away a part of the CV pile. Obligatory English exams at schools etc.). So, a lot more people actually succeed and get to B2 or C1, than in the other languages. And that is a prerequisite for reaching C2. If almost nobody reaches C1 in German through the most common means (schools, self teaching, etc), even fewer get to C2, logically. Again, languages like Japanese are in an even weaker position. In vast majority of the world, Japanese learners are just having a nice hobby, no pressure, they really need to be hypermotivated to get even to a B1ish level. Few succeed, so where do you want to grow the C2 from.\n\n\\-difficulty of access to sufficient amounts of input. Without piracy, it is near impossible to get enough input to reach C2 in any language but one locally spoken in your country or English. As long as geoblocking isn't outlawed (because it is just much of a stupid discrimination as selecting clients by race or gender), the learners of all the other languages will be at a huge disadvantage, unless they opt for piracy, vpn, etc. It is a hypocrisy, that the EU \"promotes\" learning two foreign languages, but still hasn't outlawed this discrimination. It's the biggest difference for learners from B1 up. And even the learners opting for piracy are still at a disadvantage, as it is less comfortable to look for the resources, sometimes time consuming, and you have a more limited offre. That lowers the probably of success of the masses of learners too.", "created_utc": "1660294688.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ijz07lb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wmfkr5", "parent_id": "t3_wmfkr5", "score": "14", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "Yes.

For example, it is impossible for many of us (there are simply far too few natives of my target languages learning my native language. And that is a pretty common problem). Or it is hard to really use the time well, keep it 50:50 in both languages, find meaningful activities (so not just a bunch of \"how are you\" opportunities). There is also the issue of online harassment, that is very present in the language exchange communities.\n\nSo, what I think people should take from it:\n\n\\-don't be discouraged, if you don't find a good fit. Don't waste too much time searching, it is not necessary to do language exchange in order to succeed. If you find a good fit, great. If not, no harm done. \n\n\\-the better level you are, the better are your chances. You will be a much more interesting speaker at B2 than A1, as you will be much better able to show yourself as a person and not just a beginner course content recording. \n\n\\-look for people, who are also seriously interested in improving, and make sure it is 50:50. While I have the huge disadvantage that my native language is far too unpopular (and who would want to exchange for my high level non native languages, as they can choose from tons of natives), you have the opposite problem. Many people will try to take advantage of you. They will try to just get free English practice without giving back, and they'll use the (very common) difference in level against you.

I had such problems several times in the past and recovered every time, so let me share my recipe:\n\nReviewing the basics and intermediate stuff (especially the grammar, and to some extent vocab) with resources that allow you a lot of **freedom**. So no app forcing you to go very slow. No app forcing you to do a certain amount of things in a session, or to feel like a failure for not doing stuff every day.  And probably not even a textbook, meant to give a real beginner a good mix of everything and to be completed in the designed order. Nope.\n\nWorkbooks I use allow you to do stuff in any order you want. And you can work with at any pace you want at the given time. While a textbook is not designed to let you skip between units, and an app will make you go too slowly, workbooks like I use let you make choices like \"hmm, I've just finished unit 26 on the present tense, but I need to refresh use of this preposition now, so unit 98. Ok\" or \"this is something I remember well, I'll just quickly refresh. But this is something I really need to dive into\".\n\nMy favourites:\n\nGramatica de uso del espanol A, B, C. The most thorough thing there is. I was already B2, when I was doing the A book, and I was still learning some new things. All three are wonderful.\n\nAnaya workbooks, which are smaller, but still excellent (and easier to carry around). Gramatica now goes up to C2, Vocabulario up to B2, and there are some more. They are excellent and just like the previously mentioned series, they really help learn the stuff that you use in conversation all the time, and they offer a lot of exercises as the step between understanding and spontaneous use.\n\nViva el Vocabulario is very good, but perhaps you don't need it as much as I did, back when I used it.

How do I know: I did it. I kept learning languages (and successfully) during medschool. ANd it was one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nYes, you are considering it right. The strategy I chose was progressing a lot during shorters bursts of free time (typically holidays), and then \"just\" maintanance as time permited (from the intermediate level by merging language time with entertainment time, like tv shows etc).\n\nThe key to making it work: choose well efficient resources. There is no poing in wasting your whole holiday on a stupid toy like Duolingo, just 20 hours with a better beginner resource will give you more value than 200 hours on Duo.\n\nWhat I usually did in those shorter times of high activity: I completed a coursebook, or a workbook (or more), or binge watched tv (from the intermediate level up), simply to move forward enough to profit from much slower maintenance or very slow progress afterwards, with the medschool workload.\n\nFor example: Over one summer, I completed the Anaya Spanish workbooks (Gramatica A1-A2, B1, B2, and also Vocabulario A1-A2, B1, B2) in like 5 or 6 weeks, and watched a tv series or two.

Easy to chop into smaller goals (you can be proud of every unit completed, every page read, etc).

But many others will do.\n\nAnd as your reward for getting to B1 or B2 over the summer, you can spend your precious free time (the part you would use for entertainment anyways)  in Spanish, and keep slowly improving over the year, or just maintaining it enough not to lose it till the next big study or use opportunity.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1658068383.0", "edited": "False", "id": "igis803", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w17tcu", "parent_id": "t3_w17tcu", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "Zero.\n\nI don't enjoy most childrens' content.

I attended AF (different place) ages ago, and one of the teachers was rather good (not awesome, but good), the other was a disaster (main problems: inability to teach at the needed pace required by the curriculum=wasting half the time on the first lesson and not covering the last two out of the six, an inability to make the slower students more active to not harm the actually interested learners, and not in touch with the current century).

But it is primarily about people in the cities being more educated than people in small towns, and people in touristy locations putting in extra effort, as they believe (and many tourists unfortunately enforce that) English will bring them more money. So, instead of going to Madrid or Barcelona, go to a smaller town somewhere in Asturias, Extremadura etc.\n\n\\-avoid fellow learners like a plague. What you describe in terms of exhausting yourself trying to make them speak without really getting enough reward in them actually speaking Spanish, that's horrible. And it's far too common! And it doesn't work. It's like a full time job and you won't succeed anyways. If you succeed, they'll speak like you or worse, they won't be valuable speaking partners. \n\n\\-the better prepared you are, the more you'll get out of your abroad stay. It is a waste of money to go abroad to study your basic A1ish stuff, you don't really need to practice buying a coffee much. But around B2, you actually profit from the practice, and you can make real connection with people, because you can finally express yourself, talk about something interesting, be much more yourself than at the early levels. \n\n\\-actively refuse any English. tell people politely, but assertively, that you are there to speak Spanish. make it obvious, that them using you as a free English tutor (after you've paid for your stay) is not the base for any normal contact. You may not have time to do that for a ten second interaction in a mcdonalds, but you can do that in a lot of the other activities you are talking about. doing random sports, visiting a museum, joining a dance class, going to a book fair,spending some time in a local and not that populated caf\u00e9, etc.", "created_utc": "1657897996.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ig9u4hu", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vxyhte", "parent_id": "t3_vxyhte", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "Hi!

Just a small clarification: Are you having a hard time with studying in general, with studing stuff IN Greek (as you've moved there and are integrating to the standard school there), or with learning Greek?\n\nEach of these situations has a bit different solution, even though some things are the same. Yes, trying to make fun of it is definitely an option, but not at all times. I find the current push to find fun and internal motivation through excitement at all costs rather harsh. Sometimes, you just don't find it and it's ok, adults don't find all the aspects of our jobs fun either.\n\nI recommend chopping your studies into smaller tasks, find \"fun\" or rather satisfaction in completing those. It may not be fun to study with your physics textbooks, but it may be a huge satisfaction to finaly read through chapter 5 and to complete the challenge of solving all the 10 problems. I hope my illustration makes it clearer. \n\nSo, define your goals as clearly as possible. And preferably in a quantifiable way, easy to visualise. The modern trends like \"it's not about following a textbook\" and \"it's not about learning facts, it's about multidisciplinar competences\" are extremely unfortunate in some ways. Try to really find a textbook covering the subject for a year, and make studying it one of your daily \"quests\". You can set \"quests\" for yourself like a number of minutes spent studying, a number of problems solved, number of words reviewed. \n\nAs to the various options mentioned above:\n\n\\-your active search for a solution is a good sign in any case.\n\n\\-sometimes, you need a different resource. Buying another book, if it is not too much hassle for your family, getting something useful from the library, getting an online resource, etc. Not all textbooks are equally good. And sometimes, they may just not be enough for a particular student.\n\n\\-Be active in your learning, as others say. Do a lot of exercises, it helps. Say stuff alound. Explain stuff to someone (if there is nobody available, explain them to your pet, to your house plant, or to a teddybear, all will serve the purpose). Reformulating and repeating the ideas really helps. YOu can also use a spaced repetition system like Anki for stuff that needs memorisation. Like vocabulary, or physics formulas, or biology facts. But never use it instead of understanding something. Understanding a problem (a physics topic, a grammar feature, etc) will save you tons of time and efforts and will last longer than just a memory.\n\nI hope some of this will be sueful to you.

Many people do badly in remote classes, it is by far not for everyone. I have two teenage relatives. Both clever, normal kids. No problems at school, both with above average or at worst average grades. Until the remote learning during covid. Suddenly one was failing, and the other was near failing. The combination of this worse contact, the huge amount of homework (that wasn't really that helpful, the teachers were really leaving a huge gap between the remote class, the homework, and the tests), and also the lack of realistic perception on how is the whole class doing, all that was part of it. Now that they are finally back in normal not-remote classes, they are doing fine again.\n\nAlso, there is a huge difference between the one on one online tutoring, and a group class online. Really, it is a shame covid has been used mainly to promote the later (which makes a lot of people suffer), rather than lots of self study with some guidance and testing. I've read stories of language learners doing the online group classes, and it seemed rather awful to me.\n\nThis is not your fault, it is objectively hard to communicate and learn in this manner. There is even research on how much harder is video compared to audio, when it comes to group meetings (basically: the tiny differences in video vs. audio speed are making it harder for our brains  to understand, and to connect the verbal and non verbal communication. We tire more easily as we compensate for the discrepancy).\n\nTrash quality of teachers is a common problem in schools, I wouldn't look for your fault. And yeah, your classmates might be doing better, or not. If you mean they are getting better grades, then perhaps they understand better what is being tested,or they memorise better for each test. That doesn't mean they are actually better at Spanish overall\n\nOptions on how to fix all this:\n\n1.self study\n\n\\-**the most reliable way!** But in some ways hard. You need to do not only homework, but also figure out what you need to learn, what is the problem. Then get better resources and start using them. Put in the time, you'll learn Spanish , the class will be easier as the result. And this is also the cheapest way\n\nWhat coursebook is the class following? Is it good? If not, get another one and follow it. Use SRS to learn vocab, get a grammar workbook, get it all inside your head for your own sake, not just for a class. Listen a lot to audio, repeat after it as closely as possible. Do your exercises in writing and out loud. Be active. \n\n2.in person learning\n\n\\-find a teacher for in person meetings. The most expensive way, and the risk is wasting a lot of time searching for a good teacher. Most are bad (really, the profession attracts far too many stupid people), so don't blame yourself too fast.\n\n3.online one on one tutoring with someone actually good at it\n\n\\-middle ground as far as price goes. But again,you need to spend time searching for someone actually good.\n\nOh, and options 2 and 3 should still be just a supplement to self study!!!!\n\nAnd to this:\n\n>'m Mexican and the fact that I can't speak Spanish pains me everyday, so  \n not being good at it makes me feel even worse because there's so much   \nemotional ties to my wanting to learn. I wonder if I'll ever be good at   \nSpanish or am I bound for failure.\n\nNo, you are not bound to fail. People used to think I was horrible at languages and bound to fail. I used to think it, back in highschool. But look at me now, I speak several languages (one of them at C2!), and have actively used them to improve my life both professionally and personally.   \n\n\nYou really want to learn, good. Emotional ties: good, let's consider them an advantage, not a way to punish yourself. Are you willing to put in all or nearly all your free time for some time?

Which people? Have they reached C2? And why would you think the way of these people is universally valid for everyone, including you?\n\n1.I have experience with both very early use of normal media, and also in using them only after reaching B2 with more structured and typical means (mainly coursebooks). Neither way is a huge problem, just pick what suit you better. You will not miss out on anything, if you learn mainly with coursebooks up to B2 and then dive into the normal media much better prepared.\n\n2.Easy videos and middle school books? Ok for some people, but not necessary, and actually horrible for many others. I don't like easy videos and I get bored with most books for kids younger than 12. This is not universal advice. Again, it is totally valid to get better overall at the language first, and then dive into something that really interests you. Genuine interest in the material helps a lot!\n\n> I can get the general meaning of a text or audio, but picking up vocabulary from it seems hopeless.\n\nThat's a good starting point, but it depends on what you want. There are two ways to listen (with various variations to each of course).\n\n\\-extensive listening (or reading): you start from this general meaning level and listen to a lot of content. You don't look up much in  dictionary, you get progressively better with exposure at the natural speed and to lots of content.\n\n\\-intensive listening (or reading): you really look up (almost) everything, you can even SRS it. It is more efficient for vocab in the short run, but it doesn't have many of the advantages of extensive listening.\n\nYou seem to want to do extensive, but expect the type of progress typical of the intensive.\n\n>Please tell me how long I should spend a day.\n\nThe simple answer is \"as long as you can afford to invest\", but I have a different one: You don't even need to do this every day. What I find the most efficient: binge watching a few times a week. In the mean time, I either have other life to live, or I simply spend my study time on the coursebooks and similar activities.\n\nSo, a possible plan (just an illustration, to be adapted to your preferences and needs): study 4 days a week for 40-60 minutes with coursebooks and similar stuff, binge watch tv series for a whole evening twice a week.\n\n>My vocab seems too scattered too. So just picking up a vocab deck and   \ngoing through wouldn\u2019t be good  because id already know half the words\u2026   \nplus flashcards drive me insane. does anyone know what to do this is   \nvery frustrating.\n\n\\-for the known words: just use the Ignore function of the srs or delete the cards!\n\n\\-use flascards less, or don't use them at all. they are not obligatory. One of the possible alternatives are vocab workbooks with tons of exercises, and/all making such exercises yourself (such as using all new vocab in several sentences, writing them a few times, reading out loud, learning even from lists, gold listing, etc).\n\n>After all i did learn like 100 percent of my Esperanto through flash cards and reading grammar and NOT immersion.\n\nAwesome! You already have experience, you've learnt a language. Why don't you use that experience? Why do you really on what \"people say\" so much? You found your way, that works great for you.

The saddest was being stupidly mocked by adults, when I was a kid or teen, they should have had better standards.\n\nThere are many reasons behind this, many weird ideas, prejudices, etc. And the people don't really want to talk about you anyways, they want to present their political/historical/economical/whatever opinions and listen to themselves.

Vast majority of learners get stuck at A1ish level or not even that. Spanish is probably not that easy after all.\n\n2.German is still in some ways more related to English.

While stuff like lexical similarity can be objectivised, the persception of difficulty cannot. It has a lot to do with motivation, with discipline and mindset of the learner and the teacher too. The common mindset for Spanish is like \"it is easy, no need to work that hard\" \"let's learn it for a holiday\" and \"learning should be fun\". While the common mindset for German is like \"It is hard, you'll need to put in a lot of work\" and \"let's learn it for a job\".\n\nBasically, it is a lot of self fulfilling prophecies.

There are several very good looking coursebooks up to A2. Most classes that I've seen and language schools don't really expect people to get too far either (which is strange, given the language requirement for some jobs), and don't propose more advanced classes. And the natives are plurilingual, so tons of the usual translated or original stuff suitable for A2/B1 simply doesn't exist in Luxembourgish.\n\nWhat you can do, if you really want to learn Luxembourgish (as you've invested a lot of time already, not sure why you're asking after 6 thousand hours!):\n\n\\-intensive reading and intensive listening. Look up every unknown word in a dictionary, put it to SRS, learn it. Yep, your learning curve will be steeper than in languages with more resources, but you can do it.\n\n\\-grammar: if you've outgrown your resources and cannot find level appropriate stuff for foreigners, get resources for Luxembourgish kids in schools, or even for adults.

Try to mimic the native as precisely as possible. This will help your pronunciation and it will also help your brain memorize more complex sentence structures, correct use of vocab and grammar, natural ways to say stuff in various registers. Just try to use not only the news.

These days, many people pretend as if it was normal to just watch a tv show right away and sort of understand. it is not. You are expected to understand stuff at your level (typically the audio that came with your coursebook), normal tv shows start (!) around B1/B2, you are supposed to be comfortable at C1. What you describe sounds like the early levels. So, manage your expectations. If you are still a beginner, it is totally normal to not understand much yet, let your tutors know. Don't be embarassed.\n\n2.Weak vocabulary, and less importantly weak grammar. Many listening issues are actually about these things. If you don't know the words and constructions used, you are very likely to not understand them. Keep working on your overall knowledge.\n\n3.Lack of listening practice. back to the first thing I mentioned: you actually need quite a lot of practice, and to be stronger at listening than speaking. If you're at least B1 (if not, then point 2 is more important), focus on getting a few hundred hours of practice. You can start with easier stuff like audiobooks, get through easier tv shows, up to the very hard stuff.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1649546367.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i43gxck", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tzud28", "parent_id": "t3_tzud28", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "Welsh is probably much better than the mainstream languages, as it hasn't gone through the dumbing down process.

Get a better coursebook/grammar book of the same level, do SRS, self study, get social media in French, get your entertainment in French (like in English before)\n\nYou can improve extremely well, here is an example to show you it really is possible: my sister had failed her German class in highschool and had to take an exam a month later, to not fail the year.  I took a long holiday for that. Together, we got her from near 0 to A2 in that month. She is now one of the best in the German class. It is possible, but it requires a lot of work, ideally several hours a day. We were learning German for  5-8 hours a day, plus she got like 3-4 hours a week with someone else, who was much better at German than me but not that good at learning methods. \n\nSo, you definitely can improve. You are not in such an extreme situation yet. You can get through this, but it won't be pleasant probably.", "created_utc": "1648581354.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2lpjp0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_trea4m", "parent_id": "t3_trea4m", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "You're welcome.

I am definitely not in the \"learn one and then see\" camp, because I believe strongly that 2 foreign languages should be the standard for any normally educated person. Not the exception, the standard. So, an enthusiast learning 3 to C1 in the next years (and others later) is definitely nowhere near unreasonable. But there are some other issues.\n\nLearning 3 langauges to C1 in 8 years is definitely possible and reasonable, and actually an excellent investment. You'll have plenty of time to use them and maintain them, they will enrich your CV and your personal life a lot.\n\nBut maintanance beyond 3 languages can get difficult at times, and require time. Learning your 4th language is therefore more of an issue than learning your 2nd language.\n\nMaintanance and use is also more difficult in some languages than others. It is very easy to find stuff related to your interests in big languages than in the small ones, especially if your interests are less common. Languages from closer culture are in this aspect a bit easier too. You can profit enormously from Spanish whether or not you are passionate about the \"true\" Spanish culture, and you can also enjoy various countries and all that comes from them. But are you sure you will enjoy Korean culture? Are you that enthusiastic also about Japanese culture? Which Arabic are you after?\n\nLet me use my own example here: When I discovered independent language learning and the online communities, I suddenly wanted to become a polyglot too. Unlike you, I had already achived C1 and B2 in two languages. (I couldn't have discovered any such forum otherwise). I thought I could learn a dozen languages in my life time, and pre-picked such a varied and global mix too. Now, years later, , I know four foreign languages at B2 or higher (including C2) level, and the fifth is not far bellow that. I am at the beginning of my thirties. I think I will have learnt 8 foreign languages total within my life time. But I understand now that I am actually not really interested in the Asian languages, they are not attractive enough to me personally. I am not interested in Scandinavian languages anymore, for practical reasons. I am no longer dreaming of minority languages like Welsh (no matter how much I still enjoy the way it looks and sounds). \n\nThe experience with my languages up to this point, and also all the progress of my life, have cleared the rest of the language learning path for me. I am now pretty sure about the next language I'll start, once I have the time and can put aside (and \"just\" maintain, use, and profit from) the more important languages. \n\n**So, TLDR: I recommend planning for the next few years, and deciding the rest later on. Start 1 or 2 languages, look at the plans later, when you are around B1 or B2. Reevaluate. It is totally reasonable to plan learning 8 languages within your life time, if you really devote the time to it. But I'd say making a fixed list now at the beginning of your path, that's highly unpractical.**", "created_utc": "1648565048.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i2kivcd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tqhipp", "parent_id": "t3_tqhipp", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "800 million speakers mostly in their country.The \"got to be up there\" simply isn't true.

You also need accuracy and other qualities. It's better to describe the overall levels with the CEFR (or another such scale). \"Reaching fluency\" is bad thing to discuss, because there is no clear definition of what that is.\n\n2.Of course Anki (or another SRS) will HELP reaching a solid level, if you also do other things.

Duo's Japanese course is one of the most criticised ones actually. If he wants to get some normal, steady (even slow) progress in his hobby language, he could opt for either a normal textbook, or for a better digital tool such as Lingodeer. Movies are nice, but not too helpful to a total beginner. \n\nKomal: A motivated an intelligent student, who just believed the nonsense that you can choose from only two options: teachers and apps. Had she just bought a normal solid quality coursebook, she would get much more value out of her time. She clearly expects Duo to do something else than it does, and doesn't understand that there is a difference of like 4 CEFR levels between any basic toy app and movies.\n\nAs to your final ideas:\n\nThe problem are the wrong expectations. Apps like Duo are just a toy. Perhaps, it might be better to focus on how to make the best quality learning tools more useful and friendly in their digital form. Have you also looked at the digital platforms of actually solid language courses and publishers? They have serious issues, that are a part of the reason of their low popularity \n\nPerhaps it would be more interesting to work on that, rather than revisit trash like Duo for a million times, expecting it to be something it is not meant to be.", "created_utc": "1647765141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "i1ds3pq", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tidqjs", "parent_id": "t1_i1drlso", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "an_average_potato_1", "body": "I've read this, and sorry to say it out loud: You are wrong about many things. Perhaps language learning apps should be primarily judged from the point of view of a successful and knowledgeable language learner, not just a software expert.\n\nThe first solution is a huge problem and mistake: replacing words in an English text with foreign ones is wrong, it leads to bad habits, it doesn't create real comprehension in context, it teaches grammar mistakes, etc. A foreign language is not just English with words replaced by the Target Language ones. There are already tools like that, and I am wholeheartedly convinced they create much more of a problem than a solution. \n\nLearning communities: They exist already. And again, they are a bit controversial. Some people love just any kind of practice. I personally find exposure to other beginners to be harmful to progress and one of the main problems of group classes.\n\nThe points about Duo that you've found, that's a bit of an issue without the context. Some people claim that it is \"a memory refresher\", but just as many will claim that it is just an introduction for the very basics. Both will have their reasons. The unidirectionality is true, sure. Yes, Duo should not be a standalone resource. But as some people recommend to supplement it, some others recommend to use Duo as the supplement, not the main tool.\n\nThe last one is trash. \"You learn the langauge by living it\" is some trash that is overly simplified and mostly repeated by the not successful learners, who spend years on A1 input, instead of just sitting down with a coursebook and getting to a solid level faster, based on my observation. Vocab memorisation does have some place in language learning, even though it should never be the only thing you do.\n\nThe competitor analysis: I think it shows again a rather shallow experience with language learning and today's market. The most \"similar\" (but in some ways much better) competitor is Lingodeer, at least for some languages. Other importnat ones are Glossika, Lingvist, Speakly, ... Your analysis is affected by the stuff you chose to analyse, of course.\n\nI disagree there are mostly two types, even though I see why you chose such a distinction. But yeah, you are not the first one with this distinction, and perhaps should know terms like \"edutainment\", if you want to appear serious.\n\nUsing the Duolingo language report as a resource is an obvious choice, but one that shouldn't be made without criticisms of their methodology. Don't forget, Duo is not making a report on how people learn. It is making a report on how people use the app and how to make them earn the company more money (by sticking to the addictive app and seeing ads).  For example some of the Duo's reports in the past had serious issues with what is success. Duo believes that a successful learner=one that doesn't \"give up\", doesn't leave Duolingo. And the orientation of the app is on how to make people more addicted. But in reality, a successful learner is one that learns the content of their beginner course (any!) and moves on.\n\n>My assumption about the obstacle and experience turned out correct.   \nLearning few words or phrases doesn\u2019t actually helps much practically.   \nPeople learn from their surroundings. They need to \u201clive\u201d the language   \nnot just \u201cmugg up\u201d few fancy words. \n\nNope, you and Duo's report just work with the same wrong assumptions.

However, SRS (most typically Anki) can be very useful at the high levels, to help you learn vocab from other sources more efficiently.\n\n3.You can also sign up for some classes, online learning, etc for natives.

One or two main resources, the rest needs to be just supplements. Postpone native media for now, to not waste time. It is better to be intermediate earlier, rather than focus on \"beginner\" native media imho.\n\nSo, an example of what you could do, without putting money into tons of new resources (because just throwing money on the problem won't work):\n\n\\-Finish Language Transfer (again, as you wish to review it)\n\n\\-Follow a main course, for example Assimil (if you can stand it. If not, there are other courses). Supplement it with the Practice makes perfect books, to get more structure, to really understand the used grammar, to expand on the vocab. (If you dislike these, you can replace them for example by the workbooks by Anaya, or by Kwiziq)\n\n\\-Do all the exercises both in writing and out loud, if possible. Repeat after audio as much as possible. Relisten to stuff. Write and say the corrected versions of sentences you've made a mistake in. Learn all the stuff actively, don't just read the coursebook, don't just lazily fill some exercises, do as many as you can and as thoroughly as you can.\n\n\\-Continue Anki, but don't burn yourself out.\n\n\\-Supplement this with the Dreaming Spanish or something like that, if you have time left.\n\nFocus on finishing these resources, so that you get out of the boring beginner phase and into the much more adventurous and rewarding intermediate and advanced phase, where you can finally read and watch whatever you want!!!\n\n.............\n\nEnjoy and good luck! You can do it!

So, perhaps it might be useful to have a successful learner as a part of the team, to review the material and point out issues that neither you, nor a linguist, will find.\n\nYes, accepting variations is a challenge (to put there many), and I really recommend making it one of the priorities. The ultimate judgement of the learner is important (especially for the not real beginners), but may lead to mistakes in some cases. So, the software accepting various correct versions is a good thing. The problem is not the user \"cheating\" but they are using your tool exactly to get the correction (but a meaningful one). Not sure my explanation of the interest of accepting as many correct variants as possible is clear. :-D\n\nAlso, what types of content will be there?

I am already fed up and angry about all the language learning tools promising the same quality in such languages and then disappointing.\n\n3.And learners in need of for example more science related language are not served even by the main institutions (I was told in the library of the Cervantes institute, that there would be no point in adding books about science, as everyone is a humanities oriented person there. Nonsense and a self fulfilling prophecy). So, perhaps it might be interesting to branch out in covering also the average high school level (or popular science etc) stuff in the target language.

What to look for: textbooks you find well organised, to be easily used on your own. It should definitely have a key to exercises, and also lots of exericses (that is one of the main advantages of using such books afterall). Audio should be either on CD (which is less practica) or accessible online (more and more common these days).

My only issue: most people are not deciding based on how good they are or the teacher is. They decide based on how they perceive the situation and based on the brainwashing that learning a language=paying a teacher and doing what they tell them to. Most people have no clue about their real independent study skills, because they've never really tried. And the constant discouragement almost everywhere is a huge reason.\n\n>Some people are really bad at self-study because traditional education systems do not teach people how to learn, which is fundamental to independent study. So many people spin their wheels and self sabotage. There's 2 sides to every coin.\n\nI agree that schools are to blame for lack of study skills in most people.

Of course it is a sort of economical diversion and of course it does have a lot to do with the socioeconomic situaiton of the learners.

Or the opposite, they may struggle with a general topic from the exam, but be totally competent and giving formal lectures great in content and form in their field. As long as they cross the minimum line at everything tested, they are considered to be at the level.\n\nReally, it looks like you have too little experience with the exams. You cannot get to even the 50 points by just \"guessing the multiple choice part\". For example the DALF has no multiple choice part, for start :-D\n\nThis is more of a cultural problem, rather than an issue with the exams. People from some countries, especilly the US, are used to exams that are actually not that discriminative for a big part, but a lot of the competition happens in the top part of the score. The exams are \"easy\" to get a high score at, but then there is a huge competition between people, who get a very high score and very very high score. That's simply not the case in many other countries and many other exam types.

The improvement of such alternatives has changed it all (many coursebooks, workbooks, online tools, tons of media). An average coursebook with audio is much better at presenting grammar and vocab systematically than an average teacher, and netflix is a better and more plentiful listening source than a teacher. Teachers can be in general superior to other resources only when it comes to giving solid feedback on speaking and writing. the catch: many refuse that, either out of laziness  ore  fall for stupid nonsense like believing such feedback with lots of corrections being harmful, or they suck at it.\n\nSo, I am very hesitant to pay someone the price of a good textbook for just an hour or two of work,, because I will simply not get more value for the money.

Were I in your place, I'd keep maintaining (or slowly improving) Russin and get a second foreign language\n\nHowever, I see a risk of this situation happening again and again, everytime a language stops being fun by being new, but isn't fun yet by being solid enough to let you do anything you want. So, make choices based on your real interests (basically what do you want to do with an intermediate or advanced skills in the language) and not just a short attraction.

I highly doubt many people tell themselves \"ok, I read well enough, no need to read much anymore\". But yes, most learners may be able to find pleasure in reading earlier in Italian than Russian, that's possible, but unimportant for the main question.\n\nThe main reasons people underestimate the value of reading and spend too little time on it are totally different imho:\n\n1.It is an overall lower popularity of reading for pleasure, as our society views many other hobbies as better (the kids doing sports will be socially rewarded more than the bookworms, and that affects the population as a whole a lot), and entertainment through other forms has also skyrocketed.
