Sometimes people don't have the political power they should. Getting back to cars, even if someone could afford to live anywhere they wanted, how many places are there in the US where they could live _entirely_ without a car? Yes, there are a few gentrified urban cores, and New York has a subway, but those really take take the assumption that people can afford to live anywhere to the extreme. For most people, to paraphrase Henry Ford, they can choose any lifestyle they want for their community as long as it's car dependency.\n\nAlso, I think you're ignoring the role that urban planning and zoning laws play in all of this. Nothing about single-family homes and suburban communities precludes good bike infrastructure and walkability. I've been lucky enough to live in a place where I could walk by single-family homes to the neighborhood coffee shop. A plurality of values should be respected, but I'm genuinely struggling to figure out whose values are being disrespected by bike lanes and sidewalks and zoning that allows building coffee shops within walking distance of where people live.\n\nHowever, and this is perhaps where you and I will disagree, I do think that we should be skeptical about values and where they come from. For lack of more precise language, there are some values that are worse than others. As an example, valuing your neighborhood of single-family homes because it's quiet and safe is one thing; valuing it because it's expensive and none of your neighbors are poor is entirely another. Part of r/fuckcars _is_ about examining the values that created and continue to create the environment we live in, and criticizing those that make our society unequal, unsafe, or unhappy.", "created_utc": "1665802454.0", "edited": "1665804495.0", "id": "isdfr45", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y3sftn", "parent_id": "t1_isd8ncm", "score": "2", "subreddit": "BeAmazed", "subreddit_id": "t5_363r3"}, {"author": "CocktailPerson", "body": "I've lived in some pretty hot and humid places.

This extremely time consuming element doesn't exist in most other languages.\n\nA writing system is different from a language. Yes, some writing systems have more inherent difficulty than others, but the writing system is just a representation of the language, and does not reflect the difficulty of the language itself.\n\n>Languages with complex formality levels remain challenging even for adult native speakers. This is not a factor in many languages.\n\nThis is hard to separate from culture. When native speakers make such mistakes, are they grammatical errors or misjudgements of the level of formality that's culturally required in that context? And if they are indeed grammatical errors, are they more common than the spurious mistakes native speakers of other languages make in their own native languages?\n\n>A person who speaks a tonal language is \"stepping down\" in difficulty when speaking a language where tone doesn't alter meaning, which is easier than the other way around.\n\nYou've veered off into the world of _relative_ difficulty again. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nWhen talking about _inherent_ difficulty, we have to ask whether the absolute complexity of the language is higher, or whether the complexity has just moved around. Indo-European languages don't have tones, but they do have complex systems of [inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language), often with multiple tenses and moods. Sino-Tibetan languages may have tones, but they have no inflection whatsoever. Japanese has a complex system of formality levels, which English does not, but Japanese has a simpler phonetic system than English. You're never going to compare apples to apples here.\n\nYes, of course it's going to be easier for an English speaker to reach conversational Dutch than conversational Mandarin, but that doesn't change the _inherent_ difficulty of any one of those languages.
