I'm going to write this assuming you are already taking advantage of whatever treatment options are available to you -- these are things that are helpful to me now that treatment has taken the brunt of it. \n\n1. Talk to a friend about your story. More than likely, you'll need to make an online friend to do this properly, if none of your irl friends write. Making friends who also write and who want to hear about what you're writing can help loosen the pressure because it's just talking, really - bouncing ideas off each other, squeeing, poking for more content. Sometimes one of us will write a single sentence in the other's document and that's enough to spurn writer's block. \n\n2. Write fanfic. This serves two purposes. First, it can get you dopamine from kudos and comments. Second, even though you're probably writing tropes that have been done a thousand times over, people still want to read it. \n\n3. Make a deal with yourself. You don't have to write... as long as you're doing something else that will help with your depression. Talking to friends, family, anther hobby, cleaning, therapy, whatever.

I loved mine in college. Since you have a freezer, I'd recommend cooking family meals and freezing in portions. I just graduated April 30th, so here's what I liked doing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy Walmart $1 French bread and keep it in the fridge. That prevents it from molding as quickly without requiring toasting like freezing it does. You can also check the clearance bakery items and buy whatever bread products end up in there. At my Walmart, that's usually some sort of roll and muffins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreamy vegetable soup in the slow cooker. It tastes \\*sweet\\*. I love it. Throw whatever veggies you have in a crockpot with half a cup of cream. Carrots and sweet potatoes will increase the sweetness. Throw it in a thermos and you have a good in-class option if you don't have time for an actual meal. This can be a good way to get your veggies in and even cheap if you buy veggies based on price!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEgg muffins. Buy a muffin pan (dollar store or thriftie). Whip eggs like you would for scrambled eggs and throw whatever the hell you want in there -- bacon, bell peppers, cheese, etc. Cook it in the oven then throw them in the freezer in a ziplock. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRed beans and rice. I'm a NOLA girl born and bred. I could happily eat properly cooked and seasoned red beans for every meal. Get some Tony's (not worth it to make your own mix at this scale/time in your life), soak the beans the night before, and just let them simmer all day. Mayo, tabasco, and plain rice are acceptable add ins. :p\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBologna is apparently not universally loved, but it's a super cheap and easy option. Peanut butter, too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRotisserie chickens are a good, cheap, \\*FAST\\* source of meat. Pull off a few pieces to freeze for future meals (drumsticks and breasts tend to be easiest to get to neatly). Tear into the rest with a couple cans of veggies over the next few days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWalmart has $1 burritos that I cannot complete in one sitting. They aren't phenomenal, but they taste good enough and are good for when you realize you haven't eaten in 12 hours and need something fast. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe chopped fruit is definitely more expensive, but if it's the only way you actually end up eating nutritious food, it's worth it. I liked getting the ones with pineapple or cantaloupe because even if I was willing to cut it up, I couldn't eat all of one before it went bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvest in a thermal lunchbag and thermos if you can. Keep your school mealplan to a minimum and bring food to campus even if it's at night if you can't afford to eat out with your friends. (This will be good for your friends, too. I found that often my friends had food in their dorms and chose to go spend money they couldn't afford at Taco Bell anyway. I was the most well-off in my friend group and still had to be the one pointing out that we already had food, so don't worry about being judged.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was way longer than I meant it to be, lol.

It was fine.\n\n\\*Laptop vs Desktop: I am an Aerospace major and a complete computer nerd. I love my desktop, but it's *huge*. Do most students just have a laptop, or is it common to have a desktop in your dorm too?\n\nGamers have desktops; nongamers usually don't.

Nothing breaks down boundaries faster than people coming to you because they're about to shit themselves.

Tbh, the ones  included with the desk in Franz's dorm look quite uncomfortable for  late night study sessions. Any recommendations?\n\nNot common, but I'd highly recommend it. If you loft your bed, you'll have space. I neeeever studied at the desk because of that chair.\n\n\\*How have you handled situations like getting a TV for the dorm room? One person volunteers, or split?\n\nI never had one. It definitely makes binging way easier if you have one, so think about that! Usually one person had one they wanted to put in there in my friends' dorms. Hell, one of my friend's had a dad who wanted to buy their love, so they had one in the common area, one in their bedroom, and still had to find another suite to take the third one for the year.\n\n\\*Opinions  on skipping calc and physics courses?
