For example, in Mexico people tend to make fun of indigenous people and imitate their accent (such as the ones from Yucatan), but it is not because they are making fun of the accent itself, but because the accent is an identifier for indigenous people (which have been socially treated as inferior ever since the birth of this country) and that way other people can understand who they are making fun of.\n\nNot to say there is no discrimination in LATAM or other Spanish speaking countries, but I feel it is less because of their variety being perceived as \"inferior\" or \"uneducated\", but instead because LATAM people tend to have a lot of prejudice towards people from other LATAM countries and accents are a good way to identify which country someone is from.", "created_utc": "1666921455.0", "edited": "1666922533.0", "id": "iu2hke0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yem95s", "parent_id": "t1_itzekbc", "score": "3", "subreddit": "linguistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "I'll take it, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "created_utc": "1666466062.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itd74c1", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yarxvk", "parent_id": "t3_yarxvk", "score": "1", "subreddit": "rexorangecounty", "subreddit_id": "t5_3hrl6"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "Wait, how do you know what the morse code means?

Is this true? If so, that makes it really complicated because now I would have to choose what kind of Nahuatl to learn based on my region, but since I live in Northern Mexico, there really isn't any Nahuatl communities on my region, meaning I don't really have a motive for choosing a specific kind of Nahuatl.\n\nDoes mayan also work this way?

For the sake of comedy in a lot of programs you see Mexicans doing a \"Gringo\" accent since we have our fair share of American tourists in Mexico. There are two good examples that come up from the top of my head:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  The first one is the character \"Kelly\" from the kids show \"Bely y Beto\", who is supposed to be an American character and [therefore speaks with an American accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-0onh0qUDo). I find this \"episode\" to be a pretty good example since not only you can hear \"Kelly\" speaking with an American accent, but you can hear both \"Kelly\" and \"Beto\" (whose actors don't speak English that well as you might have noticed) trying to imitate Americans when they speak English.\n* The second example is Molotov's song \"[Frijolero](https://i.ytimg.com/an_webp/8iJMOBcPQyg/mqdefault_6s.webp?du=3000&sqp=CLDzk5kG&rs=AOn4CLAH5JYyd_GjmaefeDxZNmL-CQ1nOA)\" (warning: for strong language/imagery) which is supposed to be a criticism of American xenophobia towards Mexico, and therefore the song is sung in an American accent.  In this song the accent is not as exaggerated as in the \"Bely y Beto\" episode, but it is still clearly distinguishable. \n\nI can also tell you that due to the large population of Chinese people in Mexico, it is also common for Mexicans imitate the [Chinese accent](https://youtu.be/8HFXmMZ-nmI). As you can notice in the first 15 seconds of the video, the most common trait of this accent is that they don't know how to pronounce the Spanish \"L\", so they instead pronounce it as \"L\". This is Characteristic is not common of Chinese people only however, and it is instead seen as a general \"Asian\" accent. It is commonly played for laughs, the most notable example being [chinguamiga](https://youtube.com/shorts/ik6-T5r-RR4?feature=share) (a really famous Korean influencer who lives in Mexico and makes comedy that accentuates the differences between Mexico and Korea).\n\nIt is also pretty usual to see people who live in Spanish speaking countries that share borders with other countries that speak a different language, imitate that accent for laughs. For example, my friend from Argentina used to imitate a Brazilian accent, my friend from Spain used to imitate a Moroccan accent, and in my hometown were there have recently been an increase in African immigrants, a lot of people imitate an \"African\" accent when speaking Spanish. These accents however, are only common to play for laughs between friends and it varies from region to region depending on the place you live in\n\nHope this helped!\n\nTL;DR: In Spanish it is really common to imitate American and Chinese accents for laughs, but there are also other accents such as Brazilian and Moroccan accents that are used in Spanish countries who share a border with other countries with different languages.", "created_utc": "1663372566.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ioqfpvo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xfvjh7", "parent_id": "t3_xfvjh7", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "Yeah, but financially it didn't do that well", "created_utc": "1663042936.0", "edited": "False", "id": "io7uft8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xcvrna", "parent_id": "t1_io7ssip", "score": "3", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "Well the main thing is that they closed the concert with Desert Song, a song many fans like and one that hadn't been played since 2008.

I've been studying Japanese for the past 4 months, but I got to confess that I am not the most consistent person. I just kind of get an urge every other day, and whenever that happens I start learning Japanese, however, this is not an everyday thing and the methods I use vary a lot. I know that in order to learn a language you need consistency and discipline, but I don't have neither, so why am I attempting to learn a level 4 language when I'm not mature enough to have the consistency and discipline it takes? I have been trying to learn Japanese for the past 4 months, and I've learned almost nothing at all. My vocabulary is probably less than 200 words and I have almost zero knowledge of grammar. It's just demotivating seeing how you are not accomplishing anything and it is all because of your fault.\n\nI've been recently thinking though, that maybe I should try to study Portuguese. I am a native Spanish speaker, and when I read Portuguese I can understand almost 65% of it. When it is spoken it is notably harder (I only understand about a 25%), but even then that is a world of difference. It is insane to think that I have a better comprehension in Portuguese than I have in Japanese, without even having studied the language at all unlike Japanese! I feel like maybe if I get serious about Portuguese, immersed every day, studied 25 anki cards a day, and studied a good grammar book, I could get to C1 level in 8-9 months. Compared with Japanese, I would probably take 5 to 6 years to get to a C1 level if I did all of those things. \n\nNow, why do I think I would actually succeed in Portuguese if I can't manage to be consistent with Japanese? Well, I feel it is mostly because immersing in Portuguese would be much easier for me. My main problem with Japanese immersion is that I cannot understand absolutely anything, which gets insanely boring. However with Portuguese, I can at least already get the main gist of it, which is probably going to get my dopamine receptors working, and is it going to keep me more entertained, which in turn is gonna help me focus more. \n\nI don't know what to do, Portuguese is starting to seem so convincing right now, but I don't want to drop Japanese just because \"it is too hard\".

You honestly shouldn't worry a lot about learning the kana, the average person will have a full grasp on them by day 3 and it really isn't that hard to learn.\n\nAfter this it starts getting a little more complicated because there are multiple ways you can go on about learning a language. For starters, I would suggest going to [refold](https://refold.la/) and reading the whole guide. It contains a lot of great information about how learning languages work, and it is overall a great guide.\n\nAfter reading refold you should also read [themoeway](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/) guide, which is a guide that teaches you how to learn Japanese from scratch. I recommend this because it goes into more Japanese-specific detail than refold, and it is considered to be a good guide in the Japanese language learning community.\n\nAfter reading both of those guides, you're basically all set up on your way to learning Japanese. As an extra, I would also recommend subscribing to r/languagelearning and r/LearnJapanese since the two of them have more information and are also a pretty good places to find resources.\n\nNow, before you start learning Japanese, I would like to say a few things:\n\nFirst of all, remember that learning a language takes a massive amount of time. To learn Japanese, you will take about 2200 hours, so don't get demotivated and have reasonable expectations when it comes to how long your progress is going to take.\n\nI would also like to tell you to question everything you see and to think for yourself (yes, even this comment). There are lots of different methods and people claiming to have the most effective or the best way to learn a language. There are tons and tons of them, and more often than not they contradict each other, so your best option is to try to see what works best for yourself. Everybody works differently, and what might work for someone might not work for someone else, so don't try to waste precious study time by searching for the \"fastest\" or the \"most effective methods\", the most effective method is always going to be the one you actually do.\n\nAnd finally, just have fun man. Language learning can be a really cool and fun process, so try to make it pleasurable for yourself. If you get bored while learning a language, you are going to become more likely to drop it, so try to make it fun for yourself. Immerse in content that you like, watch the things you normally would but in Japanese, and just try to spend as much time as you can with the language. Even if you don't have time, watch five minutes of an anime without English subtitles or something. Remember that 5 minutes spent learning the language are always going to be better than 0 minutes.", "created_utc": "1658562020.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihapzqy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5v5lr", "parent_id": "t3_w5v5lr", "score": "9", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "Not OP and three years later, but he is most likely talking about the third generation GBA Pokemon games (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald) in which there were certain caves with Morse code carved into their walls which gave you clues that lead you to finding special Pokemon (Regirock, Regice, Registeel)", "created_utc": "1658557705.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihak8wv", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_94doi9", "parent_id": "t1_e4cemp9", "score": "1", "subreddit": "1DaySkill", "subreddit_id": "t5_mbvb9"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "FOR FREE?!!!!", "created_utc": "1658556122.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihai0cj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5o3yx", "parent_id": "t3_w5o3yx", "score": "15", "subreddit": "Cd_collectors", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uxz7"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "Justification and Practice", "created_utc": "1658534389.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih9ceuf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5cd0p", "parent_id": "t3_w5cd0p", "score": "1", "subreddit": "PhilosophyMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u0y3"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "In my experience, it depends a lot in the school, but it does males sense to me.\n\nSome schools just have a horrible English program.

I own Link's Awakening DX on my nintendo 3DS, but I haven't played it yet, should I get the remake or just play the gameboy color one?\n3. Same question as before but with the Ocarina Of Time and Majora's Mask remasters, should I play the originals or are the remastered version better?\n\nThanks in advance!", "created_utc": "1626122042.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4ylzqr", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_oiw04h", "parent_id": "t1_h4yh0nw", "score": "1", "subreddit": "zelda", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "I have a Wii U, a 3DS, and a Switch, so I think I can play almost every mainline Zelda game", "created_utc": "1626112486.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h4y1j1d", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_oiw04h", "parent_id": "t1_h4xyk4h", "score": "1", "subreddit": "zelda", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "Diabetes", "created_utc": "1625242950.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3tkn60", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_oc8rea", "parent_id": "t3_oc8rea", "score": "1", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "We all go to hell, momma we all go to hell", "created_utc": "1624732996.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h34rw4m", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o85hhs", "parent_id": "t1_h3359cx", "score": "9", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "I wanna know know know know", "created_utc": "1624732890.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h34ropw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o85hhs", "parent_id": "t1_h332e3b", "score": "8", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"author": "_Mexican_Soda_", "body": "I don't know if this is a troll or not   \n\n\nIf it's not though, then I would recommend you to start drawing traditionally.

My reasoning for this is that the people make your expectations about it being sad so high that when the moment comes you simply feel kind of disappointed.

Also I think maybe the anime was a little bit boring for me in some episodes and I didn\u2019t really get too attached to Kaori which also played a role on me not feeling anything.
