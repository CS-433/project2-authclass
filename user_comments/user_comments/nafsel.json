(For example, if the saved sentence structure is \"If I were tall, I would reach it\" \\[with the skeleton being \"if (subject) were (adjective), then (subject) would (verb) it\"\\], possible changes could be \"If you were tall, you would reach it\", \"If I were rich, I would buy it\", etc). After a while, you get a decent collection of sentence structures. To speed things up, you could think about what would be the most useful sentence structures for you to start speaking, and then learn and practice those.\n\nWhen I practice sentence structures, I start from the basic ones and then go to the more complex ones. So the first step would be to practice very short and simple sentences (say, nominal sentences of the form \"subject + adjective\" like \"\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0629\") over and over, until their structure becomes ingrained in your subconscious. Then you start practicing more complex structures, and so on. After a while, you should be able to speak sentences of moderate complexity without too much trouble (or, at least, the sentence structure should come naturally to you - you might still not remember some of the specific words to fill in the sentence structure, though, and that's where vocabulary activation comes into play).\n\nConnectors are super important as well. Make a list of the main connectors, and try to use them with the simple sentences first.\n\nFor vocabulary activation, what I do is I pick a topic, and try to form basic sentences about that topic. If I don't remember a word, I look it up and start forming basic sentences with it. Shadowing native speakers is also useful: if you listen to, say, a podcast, stop the podcast after any sentence has been spoken, and repeat the sentence out loud, being mindful of the words used.\n\nIn general, memorising native texts could be quite useful as well.", "created_utc": "1664001618.0", "edited": "1664028987.0", "id": "ipoug7a", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xmjtsg", "parent_id": "t3_xmjtsg", "score": "30", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nafsel", "body": "Yay!", "created_utc": "1663931371.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipl0x6b", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlmrrk", "parent_id": "t1_ipkozgs", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Professors", "subreddit_id": "t5_2svhp"}, {"author": "nafsel", "body": "This is completely normal in many countries in Europe, where you legally need to have some form of identification on you all the time (when in public).", "created_utc": "1663908673.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ipkafk8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xlmrrk", "parent_id": "t1_ipk8z9v", "score": "76", "subreddit": "Professors", "subreddit_id": "t5_2svhp"}, {"author": "nafsel", "body": "In Italian, \"Bleah!\" or \"Puah!\"", "created_utc": "1662824939.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inv9itt", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xaip6v", "parent_id": "t3_xaip6v", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "nafsel", "body": "Good ol' Jeremy Bentham, I suppose?", "created_utc": "1662746342.0", "edited": "False", "id": "inr71lm", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x9xnzk", "parent_id": "t1_inqu8fp", "score": "12", "subreddit": "Professors", "subreddit_id": "t5_2svhp"}, {"author": "nafsel", "body": "This is completely anecdotal, but all the people I know from Rome speak pretty much standard Italian with their family and friends, with perhaps a bit of a dialectal influence here and there (e.g. \"Che stai a fa'?\" instead of \"Che stai facendo?\"), but nothing too major.

I found this passage from [https://www.hss.edu/conditions\\_does-ana-negative-lupus-exist.asp](https://www.hss.edu/conditions_does-ana-negative-lupus-exist.asp) explaining it: \"Some laboratories dilute blood samples 10-fold (1:10) to screen, some 100-fold (1:100), and some not at all. A commonly used method starts with a dilution of 1:10, then doubles with every successive dilution, so the next specimen tested is 1:20, then 1:40, 1:80, etc., with the highest number positive being what the laboratory reports (for instance, 1:1280). A laboratory that begins at 1:40 may call a test positive, while a laboratory that begins at 1:100 would call it negative.\"", "created_utc": "1659528872.0", "edited": "1659529486.0", "id": "iirthl4", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wf2t2c", "parent_id": "t1_iirsqxq", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Autoimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cy3p"}, {"author": "nafsel", "body": "When diagnosed ANA was 1:800.", "created_utc": "1659528160.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iirs7a2", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wf2t2c", "parent_id": "t1_iirrgav", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Autoimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cy3p"}]
