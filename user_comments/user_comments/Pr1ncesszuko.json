Es war sch\u00f6n mir alle Musiker anzuh\u00f6ren und \u00fcber die Kom\u00f6dianten zu lachen. \n\nWenn du nach S\u00fcd-Afrika kommst, komm kurz bevor \u201eSuidoosterfees\u201c beginnt und wir gehen zusammen hin.\n\nSchreib mir bald!\nMit freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen Eichard \n\nQuick commentary on things I noticed that could improve your overall German a lot if you payed a little more attention to them:\n\nWhat Artikel to use with which words (Der, Die, Das), try to remember them with the words and check if you are consistent throughout your text. \n\nDu or Sie, choose one and stick with it, usually if you call someone by their first name in Germany you will also address them as Du :)\n\nGenerally proof read and check that everything is consistent and that there are no typos!

learning a language (while learning English)?\n\nIf you generally have trouble with pronunciation (some people are naturally good, some people naturally a little worse at grasping and reproducing the sound of a foreign language), Chinese might not be the best idea, you can still learn it but it will be a lot harder. \n\nIf you are okay with pronunciation but struggle with Grammar/ learning and grasping grammatical/theoretical concepts, Chinese may be the better choice, since it keeps grammar to a minimum, and German is very complex in that aspect. \n\nBoth are difficult languages, but they are difficult in very different ways, and since ur not learning for the love of the language but for the advantages another language brings, you may want to take the \u201ceasier road\u201d for you here, assuming that both languages are equally advantageous for your career plans of course. \n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of facts that you may want to take into consideration for each language (there\u2019s more, especially for German but I\u2019m not a German learner so I probably won\u2019t think of all of them). \n\nChinese:\n- different writing system (characters/ no alphabet), you will have to memorise many many different characters\n- tonal language, accurate pronunciation is key for understanding \n- no relationship to the languages you already know\n- no complicated grammar (no conjugations etc.)\n- a vast pool of media content in the TL (as long as you know how to find/look for it)\n\nGerman:\n- complex grammar \n- uses Latin alphabet (with a few extras) \n- some similarities to English\n- medium amount of TL content \n- pronunciation is important but even a heavier accent will be understood by most people\n\nLastly one aspect you may want to take into factor with your decision:\nThe options/prospects for studying abroad, or just visiting even, in Germany are (at least currently) a lot better than the ones in China.", "created_utc": "1627217856.0",

traditional characters it does not automatically mean it\u2019s Cantonese. \n\nAs for audio, someone else said it already, but the easiest way would be to listen for consonants at the end of syllables (except for -n) especially \u201chard sounding consonants\u201d (K T etc), that\u2019s most likely Cantonese since Chinese doesn\u2019t have those. \n\nYou should be able to learn how to discern them

And I have not been able to shake this feeling ever since\u2026 so yeah that\u2019s were I started paying more attention (to me personally gender and pronouns have never played any significant role, I accepted myself as \u201ea woman\u201c and with \u201eshe/her\u201c pronouns cause that\u2019s what someone decided to call me when I was young and I just got used to it. And since to me they\u2018re just words without any real meaning I just went along with it. (What I\u2018m saying is: if someone had called me he/him or a boy when I was young I would have accepted that as well no questions asked)..) however as I grew older people started to put meaning into those words, making these words define who I am as a person. And at that point being referred to as the poster child for a \u201ecis woman\u201c I realised that for the first time. Since then I\u2018ve been paying more attention, and also thinking and experimenting a lot. \n\nI have switched to all/any pronouns for now, since I really feel like I don\u2019t have any preference for pronouns, I would actually feel happy if someone addressed me as \u201ehe/him\u201c sometimes (sadly I seem to have the \u201eface of a woman\u201c (or body) through and through, so no matter what I wear/act like or whatever I pretty much always get addressed as she/her\u2026). Some people have started using they/them when talking about me and I\u2018m actually extremely happy about that. \n\nAs for my gender identity, I still have no clue. I don\u2019t think I feel the absolute need to be a man (although I wouldn\u2019t hate to be one either), but I do sometimes feel like I would want to be built/look more androgynous\u2026 so maybe I\u2018m leaning towards non-binary. But since pronouns to me are really just words that don\u2019t carry meaning (for myself) I don\u2019t need people to refer to me as they/them\u2026 the only problem here is, that if I don\u2019t explicitly use they/them pronouns a lot of people will undoubtedly put me into the \u201ewoman\u201c category, no questions asked\u2026 and that again makes me feel weird. \n\nSo yeah just know that you are not alone in this struggle, maybe you will find your solution\u2026 but for now it\u2019s already a great start to be one step closer to finding out who you really are (by questioning whether or not who you have been seen as so far is really who you are). \n\nGood luck and you\u2018re not alone, there is no rush in finding the you you are comfortable with, take your time to experiment and find it out slowly :).", "created_utc": "1625303732.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h3wk2f5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_ocjndb", "parent_id": "t3_ocjndb", "score": "2", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vcez"}, {"author": "Pr1ncesszuko", "body": "Also the \u201eein(en\u201c a lot of people use (at least I do) is pronounced slightly different, like there\u2019s more emphasis on the \u201eN\u201c I feel\u2026 also when I say \u201eeinn Apfelkuchen\u201c I know that I\u2018m saying/supposed to be saying \u201eeinen\u201c.

Using it is what makes the difference I\u2018d say. It is definitely possible to learn a good number of things about a language through watching movies, but it probably won\u2019t suffice as your only learning tool. It also greatly depends on what language you\u2018re learning, let me give you two real life examples:\n\nI learned a great portion of my English through watching TV series (and reading books), I started out understanding very little, but with time I got used to it, and now years later I understand English on a similar level as I do my native language. \nHowever, I did also have some English in school (which did not help in teaching me English but it helped with applying and reinforcing what I had learned \u201enaturally\u201c), and I also surrounded myself and still surround myself with a LOT of English language input (social media, books, friends etc.). I have never had to actively learn any grammar theory. \n\nNow, Chinese. This was/is an entirely different experience. You may know, Chinese is a tone based language, meaning depending on what tone a word is pronounced in, the meaning changes. \nThere\u2019s a good amount of people out there that are convinced that watching Chinese TV is not helpful for learning the language at all. \nI will have to disagree on that. Watching Tv has taught me a great deal of things I would still have problems with otherwise. The most important parts being: basic vocabulary, sentence structures, listening comprehension and the overall sound of the language. \nNow the difference here is, that to really learn the language I had no choice but to actively learn some theory as well (written characters are obviously not learned solely by watching Tv, pronunciation is 100% more important than with non tonal languages, meaning while it made learning new vocab easier, I still had to separately learn the vocab again). Also there are so many things about the Chinese language that are just not graspable through Tv only. \n\nSo long story short(er)\n1. It depends on the language ur trying to learn, it is definitely possible to learn a whole lot of grammar and words (especially when/how to use them) through TV.\n2. Tv as ur only resource likely won\u2019t suffice, if ur not a fan of theoretical learning, it can help with making that a whole lot easier though. \n3. It depends on your own learning style and preferences, there are some people who find it extremely hard to learn this way, and other people who find it comparatively easy.

And review the next day/couple of days.\n\nNote that most of the time it\u2019s easier to learn actual words not singular characters (unless the character is commonly used as a single character word), since most characters have too many meanings standing alone. \n\nSome recommendations for apps: \nChineasy, is an app that gives you the stories to a couple of characters, but it\u2019s only free for the first few, afterwards you\u2018d have to pay (I used it while it was free, it may be useful to get used to the \u201emaking up stories\u201c thing or also recognising components that actually look like what they\u2018re representing).\n\nI\u2019m assuming you already know about pleco but if you don\u2019t definitely go get that, it\u2019s the best dictionary app out there for learning Chinese.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of free Chinese learning apps out there, I liked using them when I was starting out with Chinese, simply since it helps with getting a feel for the language if ur completely new. I don\u2019t use them anymore though.\n\nEdit: I\u2018m adding this since I just thought of it: \nDefinitely try to learn the correct stroke order for the characters u learn. Writing the same character in the same order every time will do wonders with helping ur hand remember how to write even without actively remembering (muscle memory).", "created_utc": "1624612875.0", "edited": "1624613256.0", "id": "h2z76sg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7gg23", "parent_id": "t3_o7gg23", "score": "3", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "Pr1ncesszuko", "body": "Or did u mean whether they like you as a friend or in a sexual/romantic way???", "created_utc": "1624611723.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2z5ztw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7jiy8", "parent_id": "t3_o7jiy8", "score": "2", "subreddit": "pansexual", "subreddit_id": "t5_2spwe"}, {"author": "Pr1ncesszuko", "body": "We\u2019ll give urself some time to get to know this person, and at some point you will know whether it\u2019s romantic attraction or platonic friendship :)", "created_utc": "1624610503.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2z4rcl", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7jiy8", "parent_id": "t3_o7jiy8", "score": "3", "subreddit": "pansexual", "subreddit_id": "t5_2spwe"}, {"author": "Pr1ncesszuko", "body": "Laufen (this can also mean running in some cases though)\n\n\u201eLass uns hin laufen\u201c (let\u2019s walk there)\n\n\u201eIch hab keine Lust mehr zu laufen\u201c (I don\u2019t want to walk anymore)\n\nThere\u2019s two alternatives:\n\u201eZu Fu\u00df gehen\u201c which is mostly used to make clear/emphasise that ur not taking the Bus or train or car etc. But \u201egoing by foot\u201c.\n\nAnd if ur only aimlessly walking around without a certain destination, you\u2018d say \u201espazieren\u201c.", "created_utc": "1624610199.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2z4fwg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7jlc2", "parent_id": "t3_o7jlc2", "score": "3", "subreddit": "German", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq51"}, {"author": "Pr1ncesszuko", "body": "For time we mostly use \u201ekurz vor\u201c so you would say \u201ekurz vor halb \uff08neun)\u201c.
