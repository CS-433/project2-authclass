My point is I suspect you\u2019d do much worse in 960 (assuming you\u2019re at a chess level where you can comfortably play 10 moves of prep against/with e4, d4, c4). Then I believe that the following can be deduced from this: because white will get the choice of which opening to play, and therefore will know the correct setup  (1 of potentially thousands of reasonable early opening setups) from the engine, and could memorise the plans/tactical themes/lines which their opponent wouldn\u2019t know, because they couldn\u2019t know in advance which lines their opponent has studied (and it would be a much bigger task to deal with as black imo), they would have a much bigger advantage. \n\nPlease correct me if I\u2019m wrong, (and this is the opinion of none other than Magnus Carlsen I believe) good opening preparation was more effective at the elite level before extensive computer preparation - Kasparov often blew his opponents off the board with prep for example. Why? Because he knew the plans better than his opponents/he knew more moves etc. And this is Kasparov vs humans, I\u2019m talking about SF vs humans.  \n\nAlso you clearly don\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve said, openings aren\u2019t more important due to less prep, they\u2019re more important due to the increased volatility of the evaluations during the opening/importance of understanding plans in positions. So small amounts of sharp prep that your opponent cannot prepare for at all (whereas they usually will be studied in standard) will, I believe, be more lethal. White, imo, will have this prep generally speaking, and black will not, because of the advantage of choice.\n\nLast but not least, if you find a titled player that suspects almost all supergms don\u2019t have at least 10,000 lines studies then I\u2019ll grant you the last point, but otherwise, that is a *conservative* estimate, which I will take to be useful for rough calculations.\n\nEdit: also ofc black scores fine in current 960 **no one is doing prep for 960 atm**", "created_utc": "1666740824.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itsg6qm", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yddds5", "parent_id": "t1_itsan9z", "score": "1", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Master-of-Ceremony", "body": "\u201cThe opening is more critical than usual\u201d - in standard chess we take the opening for granted due to theory, but it is actually a tremendously complicated (I\u2019ve seen a quote, but idk where from, saying the most complicated) part of the game, where our opponents may set up potentially game ending traps (look at Magnus\u2019 1. \u2026 g5 against Naka today).\n\nOn the \u201cunsourced\u201d nature of my claim, most GM Chessable lifetime courses on a single opening have well over 1,000 lines that they are WILLING to release. I mean there are NM courses as white with 1200 lines for heavens sake. And as a simple (conservative in my opinion) numerical estimate, suppose you learn 10 lines a day, 200 days per year, allowing the rest of them for review/rest, for 20 years. Then you have learn 20,000 lines. 960*100 (and many positions will transpose) is 96,000, i.e. the SAME order of magnitude. \n\nChoose a 960 position, there are maybe 2-6 reasonable first moved as white, probably in the order of 100 reasonable 2/3 first moves as white, so for black to prepare against a 960 position where white dictates the position would probably require significantly more effort.\n\nTry not to come across as such a dick btw chief", "created_utc": "1666736523.0", "edited": "False", "id": "its6mav", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yddds5", "parent_id": "t1_its4hoo", "score": "2", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Master-of-Ceremony", "body": "If the scenario presented in the first paragraph is taken then experienced players will have been playing mostly 960 for 20 years", "created_utc": "1666735768.0", "edited": "False", "id": "its4wkw", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_yddds5", "parent_id": "t1_its4etq", "score": "3", "subreddit": "chess", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhr7"}, {"author": "Master-of-Ceremony", "body": "Ah okay, so it\u2019s kind of like \u201ccould have\u201d and \u201ccould of\u201d in English - sure \u201ccould of\u201d isn\u2019t correct, but large groups of native speakers use it I\u2019m everyday speech to the point where it doesn\u2019t matter which one you say.

I was wondering if I could probe your expertise on some of the things you have mentioned.\n\nI have decided to still make as many lines as I was but not memorise most of them until I am much stronger (assuming that happens), which I think should just help me be familiar with the ideas, which I think makes sense. As for depth, most of the lines I make go around 12-15 moves deep or further if they are very forcing, and I try to cover most of the common deviations in masters' databases before move 9ish, depending on the opening. The effort I put into writing ideas down varies on my tiredness, but in general I try to write something like this for each line (this is for one line as white in the Caro, where the deviation occurs for black on 8. ... Bh7)\n\nPGN: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 Ne7 6.O-O h6 7.Nbd2 Nd7 8.Nb3 Bh7 9.a4 Ng6 10.a5 Be7 11.c4\n\nComments:  8. ... Bh7  - prepares Ng6 (or Nf5). If Ng6 is played first can allow white to grab space on the kingside \u00e1 la tempo with h3, Ne1, g4 plans. We continue as usual in these lines grabbing queenside space.\n\n11. c4 - This is our response to most of black's moves after a5. A simple plan here that is often effective involves cxd5, and places the bishops on d3 and d2 (or e3 in some cases), allowing Re1 to support e5 in the event of f6. Given the space advantage (f4 may also be useful at some point) on all sides of the board, we generally want to improve our pieces rather than trading them, as they have greater potential than black's, with the exception of the light-square bishops.\n\nThe comments come from a combination of looking at GM games and what Stockfish suggests. I think this should be worthwhile studying since it will help me think about what ideas are good in these positions, even if I know it is exceedingly unlikely people at my level (including myself) remember all of the moves.
