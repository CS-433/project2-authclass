Oh yeah be extra careful and look out for ice on the roads, you can mostly tell if you see one shiny spot in the road because if you hit it your car will slid and that will be a scary experience. Finally if you do end up sliding make sure you turn into it to regain control and don't break. But best bet for all that, get winter tires. Also get a snow broom (I don't know what the actual name of it is.) But it's the broom type thing you use when it snows and you use it to sweep and scrape the ice and snow off your car. \n\nAnd be prepared to do extra work in the mornings because you'll wind up sweeping your driveway and defrosting your car. Of course that'll depend on where you live.
