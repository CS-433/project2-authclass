Ned suing is extremely unlikely. The danger is Alex or one of the other employees. This is why there are rules in the workplace about who is or is not allowed to date. Ned pursued a relationship with a subordinate. ANY superior/subordinate relationship is an abuse of power and a huge conflict of interest. It\u2019s why managers are not allowed to date their employees, because if it goes sour it invites the possibility of all kinds of abuse of power/sexual harassment/hostile workplace environment lawsuits. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. What I\u2019m saying is that their company lawyers will have advised them to cover all bases in case that does happen. Because if it does, anything they\u2019ve said online would go in as evidence. Even if a subordinate employee consents to a relationship or actively participates in a relationship with a superior, they STILL have grounds to sue and would have the upper hand if they did decide to sue. At that point the company might have to prove that no abuse of power occurred, and that at no point did Alex feel like she was coerced to enter or stay in the relationship because she feared for her job security. It\u2019s just all very sticky. It\u2019s a hot hot mess and the mere POSSIBILITY of it getting litigious puts the company in danger. I don\u2019t think anyone can confidently say yes they\u2019re going to court over this. I\u2019m only saying that they\u2019re being very careful JUST IN CASE because if they do go to court and they haven\u2019t taken precautions, it can get really ugly for them really fast. \n\nThis is also why Ned would likely have no ground to stand on in terms of suing the other guys for kicking him out.

One of my favorite things about it is all the extra chaos they add to the Bennet family like the listening at doors, the bickering and bargains (between ALL the siblings, not just Kitty and Lydia) or the scene where Bingley shows up unexpectedly and they have to clean up the drawing room in record time and everyone picks up sewing and books like \u201cah yes this is what we always do at home I swear\u201d. \n\nI also appreciate some of the different perspectives on the characters. Like the 2005 Mr. Collins and the 1995 Mr. Collins are pretty different but wow are they both excellent pictures of Mr. Collins. Likewise with Darcy!! I think Firth is still probably the more accurate Darcy, but I just LOVE how uncomfortable MacFayden looks in every single scene. It really adds some credit to Darcy\u2019s claim of not being socially adept.

I have never in my life met an Armenian who was anything but WILDLY impressed that a foreigner would want to learn about the language or culture. Actually Armenians find it very flattering when people take an interest in our culture and very impressive when people try to learn the language.

I'd never experienced anxiety and depression to that degree and I had a medical history of both of those conditions.\n\nWhen I felt I couldn't take it anymore, I made arrangements to give her to a breed-specific rescue that already had a dozen homes vetted and ready to go for puppies. They even told me they would let me know where they settled her and how she was doing. The decision had been made, but I was so deeply unsure. I had a horribly nasty feeling that no matter what choice I made, it would feel like the wrong one. I knew that I would feel like I had made a mistake no matter what I did. The day before I was supposed to confirm with the rescue, I decided not to do it. I kept her and decided to ride it out.\n\nWhat followed was some of the worst mental health lows I've ever experienced. Things would get slightly better and then drastically worse again. (I should mention that I had my entire family helping with my pup. If I had been alone, I don't think there was any way I could have handled that.) My puppy is ten months now.

It's very possible that it might have only gotten harder, and you would've ended up wishing you'd rehomed your pup earlier before you bonded with him even more.

Sometimes people don't see a change in their puppy's biting behavior until their adult teeth come in (5-6 months). \n\nAlso, please make sure your puppy is getting a lot of socialization to make up for the lost time with her litter! Make sure you're socializing her with lots of sounds and sights and dogs and people whenever possible. She doesn't have all her vaccinations yet so be careful taking her outside and only introduce her to dogs you know are vaccinated. You can look up socializatoin techniques online too. It's especially important to keep up with it for puppies who did leave te litter too early. I highly recommend puppy classes for this. She will learn so much in puppy classes that will fill a lot of the gap that might be left by being removed too early.\n\nShe sounds a lot like my puppy (we got her at 5 weeks bc mom rejected the litter). She was a terrible biter and bite training took a long time with her but she's fine now, and well-socialized because of puppy school. She used to be very timid and after a couple of months of puppy school is now very curious and friendly instead of scared. Also, scolding won't work, especially on a puppy this young. She is very likely to think it's just exciting and fun, or just get scared. She's literally a baby right now and has a lot to learn so she needs a lot of patience. Older dogs will understand \"scolding\" commands like \"no\" and \"stop it\" but I've rarely seen this work on young puppies.", "created_utc": "1612853553.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gmo9jfd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_lftywl", "parent_id": "t3_lftywl", "score": "6", "subreddit": "dogs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhk"}, {"author": "MinuteLibrarian", "body": "this exactly!!!

I would trust your vet above any internet advice about food. You can always get a second opinion from a different vet. There are a lot of ingredients in dog food that are totally fine that have been \"flagged\" as unhealthy by dog enthusiasts and people looking to sell boutique food.

I am a little afraid of it getting worse because I know symptoms tend to peak or take a more serious turn (if they're going to) at around 7-10 days so I can keep you updated if that happens. \n\nAs a whole, I would take studies/articles about correlations like that with a grain of salt. (I say this to myself as well to ease my significant health anxiety) because the truth is we know too little about this virus and why it affects people so differently in order to make definitive broad judgements like that. This may be a correlation, but without significant research I doubt it says much about how LIKELY it is someone will become severely ill just because they had diarrhea as an initial symptom. \n\nAlso, I have yet to hear of any babies or children becoming severely ill with COVID so I think your baby will likely be just fine. As others have said, make sure you're all staying hydrated with not just water but something with electrolytes, like pedialyte or gatorade. I'm not sure what's acceptable for babies as young as yours but your doctor will definitely know. Dehydration might be more threatening to your baby than covid. Otherwise, I recommend you all get tested and quarantine just in case, even if tests come back negative (I tested negative two weeks ago but am positive now)\n\nAnother thing: I deeply empathize with your anger about being exposed due to no fault of your own. It's so unacceptable that someone else would put you and your family in harm's way like that.

I even posted an aggression question myself on this sub when my pup was 9 weeks old lol. She's 6 months now and definitely not aggressive. She's mouthy and a complete brat, but not aggressive. \n\nit is HIGHLY unlikely that your puppy is aggressive. Dogs who are aggressive tend to develop it later in life and the vast vast VAST majority of puppies are not being aggressive when they behave this way, no matter how terrifying it sounds when they growl at you. It's far more likely that she is reacting because of frustration. Some pups (mine included) have a very low frustration tolerance and biting is a natural way for them to react when they are frustrated. So of course, if she has discomfort from worms that would make it worse. If she hates being handled, that would make it worse.\n\nBite inhibition is difficult for some puppies and it might take her weeks to catch on. Right now she might be way too young to understand, but continue what you're doing. it takes a lot of consistent reinforcement with pups. I would also look up frustration tolerance in puppies and focus on ways to calm her down and positively condition certain things that make her react this way. It might not always be successful (our dog still hates being picked up) but I can tell you with almost complete certainty that your puppy doesn't have aggression issues and unless you have a lot of money to throw around, I highly doubt it's necessary to hire a professional at this point. 10 week old puppies are like babies in that they have hardly any brains. Hang in there, teething will only get worse before it gets better but take comfort in the fact that your pup's behavior is very very normal.

I am so sorry for the long response, but when I was going through it, I would've appreciated every detail.\n\nSo it sounds like you may have also gotten your puppy a little too early. (I got mine at 5 weeks, and they say puppies shouldn't be separated from litter before 8 weeks.) the anxiety of this was alone was enough to eat me alive. (For the record, despite the fear-mongering you read online, these puppies can still be fine. Just make sure your pup meets a lot of people, and enroll in puppy class as early as you are able and be consistent with going. As long as your pup is socialized with people, dogs, and different places early and consistently, you should be fine.) \n\nDon't be afraid to look up different things that might help. Crating, tethering, x-pens, etc. Don't be afraid to try things that might make life easier for you. (For instance, everyone says you have to take your pup out at night for potty training. The lack of sleep made my anxiety so bad I couldn't do anything anymore. So I got our pup an x-pen attachment for her crate and left pee pads overnight, fully knowing I might be extending our potty training ordeal. But I NEEDED to sleep so I went against people's advice because it didn't seem like something that would be too terrible. I was right. She peed on the pads and not in her crate and the added upside was that she learned to be alone overnight while she's sleeping. She's 5 months now and doesn't pee in the house, even at night)\n\nSo around 13 weeks is when my puppy was at her WORST. The biting was terrible and I was at my wit's end even though she was sleeping through the night at that point. I say this because it would've been helpful for me to know when the bad behavior was going to peak. (3 month mark, for me and for a lot of others). Keep trying. Try puppy school, tether training (this was really helpful for us), x-pen playtime, and bully sticks to keep your pup busy and away from body parts he wants to chew. (bully sticks are the LONGEST lasting chews i've found and they are safe for puppies as long as he's supervised and has plenty of water.) I also recommend kong toys to keep your pup busy. \n\nBy 13 weeks my blues were so bad I actually contacted a rescue who had homes lined up for puppies. I was convinced I couldn't keep her, I had never felt so terrible and anxious in my life and it had been WEEKS by that point. I thought I couldn't take it. The day I was supposed to confirm with the rescue, I knew I couldn't go through with it. Anything I was going through taking care of her was nothing compared to letting her go. I know how bad that pain is, so I could never judge anyone who feels like they can't keep their puppy. It's SO so hard. But I did end up keeping mine. and I'm so glad I did because by 16 weeks EVERYTHING WAS SO MUCH BETTER. The potty training, the biting, the anxiety. Just SO MUCH BETTER. I was finally able to appreciate my pup more than I worried about her or was frustrated about her. Now at 5 months, I finally feel like I have a life again. She goes to daycare and puppy school and is so much better around the house. It DOES get better.

Try to start really close so she might not even notice she's tied up if she has something to do. Make it fun, take it slow and hopefully she'll get use to it and won't have free roam of the house to come up and bite whenever she wants. You can move away from her if she bites and she can't come after you.

When our puppy was younger, around 8-10 weeks, I couldn't get her to nap longer than one hour. the guideline is 1 hour awake 2 hours asleep and we were doing 2 hours awake 1 hour asleep.

He's still young enough to improve with enough reinforcement. I would highly recommend a puppy class/puppy playtime with other older puppies. The benefit of these classes is there will often be other big dogs like yours and the smaller puppies are older so they feel okay with bigger dogs PLUS there is the added benefit of having a handler or a trainer who can help with correcting your dog's behavior. It might be slow going but it IS possible. People act like there's no hope for dogs over 16 weeks and it's just not true. Even older puppies learn a LOT from continuous socialization and 6 months is still pretty young, especially for a newfie. \n\nI got my GSD puppy at 5 weeks and was TERRIFIED at the prospect of her being badly socialized because she was separated from her litter too early. She has learned a lot from puppy class and puppy socials with other dogs her age and size. She's doing great now. We take her to Zoom Room which has training classes for dogs of all ages and a bunch of different locations. They have supervised puppy playtime for older puppies aged 4 - 8 months. Last puppy playtime I took her to, there was a newfie AND a great dane. If there's a zoom room near you i HIGHLY recommend it. If not, plenty of training centers have a puppy kindergarten for younger and older puppies. It's a great way to have supervised socialization for your dog and you might meet other people with big dogs like yours, which may make learning for your dog a little easier.", "created_utc": "1597984102.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g2amc3g", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_idn59r", "parent_id": "t3_idn59r", "score": "1", "subreddit": "puppy101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw7o"}, {"author": "MinuteLibrarian", "body": "Unfortunately the truth is she's too young to get it. You seem to be doing great bite inhibition training, and while it does work quickly for some puppies, the vast majority need months of consistency before they stop biting. My best advice is to continue what you're doing and don't be discouraged if it sometimes seems like your pup is actually getting worse. ESPECIALLY because she's a retriever breed and they're on the list of breeds for whom the biting months are a particular nightmare. Ours is on the same list (german shepherd mix) and it was months of ankle nipping and finger chewing before she finally started to understand. You might read some incredible bite inhibition success stories from others. For retriever and herder owners, it's a slog through the teething months.\n\nI don't want to freak you out, but it might not completely stop until all her adult teeth are in (around 6 months). Our puppy is 5 months old now and it's just in the last few weeks I've started to notice her getting better. She bites less and is much gentler when she does decide to chew on me. Her worst biting stage was between 11 and 16 weeks and it nearly drove me crazy. After this, her adult teeth started to come in and I finally noticed a difference. Continue what you're doing, and as she gets older and inevitably more excitable, keep a close eye on her interactions with the kids. If at any point she seems too excited, jumping up and zooming around, etc, I would separate her from the children until she's calm or had a nap. Zoomies have led to some nasty bites in my household which hurt like hell even for adults. \n\nBest advice I can give besides what you're already doing:\n\n1. Enroll her in puppy school as early as possible. Just one or two sets of shots should make this perfectly safe for her. We've been going to Zoom Room and I have loved the experiences she has there. She's learned so much from the trainers and other dogs. They have locations around the country and are very affordable compared to private training. Wherever you choose, just make sure they roll with positive reinforcement training, have supervised puppy social time, and have current vaccine requirements for all their dogs.\n2. From 8 weeks, our puppy had a serious issue with self-settling that was related to her biting. Once I noticed she was getting NIGHTMARE nippy and couldn't calm down I enforced naptime in her crate/x-pen. She would cry a little and then go to sleep and was much better when she woke up.\n\nHang in there!! Our puppy's biting was such a nightmare that for a long while I wasn't sure if we were the right home for her. But if you stick it through, I promise your retriever is going to be a loving and faithful companion for your family for years to come.", "created_utc": "1597420997.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g1gcrqo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_i9lx3w", "parent_id": "t3_i9lx3w", "score": "2", "subreddit": "puppy101", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw7o"}, {"author": "MinuteLibrarian", "body": "Okay some people have some really deep answers and I just came here to say I really fucking miss 3D Doritos.

He went from being the picture of health to just completely vanishing in the span of three months. He was the kind of person everyone loved and it was honestly horrific to witness for our whole family. I was only 11 years old and absolutely shattered about it. My grandparents had practically raised me. The days following his death, when everyone was frequenting my grandparents\u2019 house to aid our mourning, I was doing everything possible to stay out of the house. At one point I went down into the garage of the apartment complex, which was a place I\u2019d spent so much of my childhood playing. On the wall was a chalk drawing my grandfather had done. In their parking spot was the 1994 Camry that he had loved driving. It was covered in dust since no one had driven it since his diagnosis. I was so overwhelmed in the moment that for some strange reason I wrote in the dust on his car \u201cwe miss you.\u201d I knew it wouldn\u2019t reach him, I did it more for me. \n\nLater on our way home my mom started crying saying that someone had left a kind message on my grandpa\u2019s car. I don\u2019t know that it occurred to her that someone in the family may have done it. She took it as a sign that my grandfather had been so widely loved, some completely unrelated person, totally random, might have left that message. (Honestly, given how infectious my grandpa\u2019s happiness had been, it isn\u2019t that implausible) I think the idea gave her some comfort at the time.

I see there are people saying it's possible and it IS except that it might be one of the hardest things you ever do. We got a pup a couple months ago (she's 4 months now) and honestly there is no way I would have managed taking care of her if my entire family wasn't home because of COVID. I don't know if you've ever had puppies before where you were the main caretaker, but honestly I wouldn't recommend a puppy to anyone unless they know they love raising puppies. Puppies are kind of awful lol especially if you don't have all hands on deck. Just the sleep loss alone would've made me crazy if I was still working while taking care of her. I KNEW it would be super hard to raise a pup and I was still blindsided by how difficult it really is. They really are like babies and babies need pretty constant supervision. You don't have a life anymore while they're still really small.\n\nLike others, my best recommendation is really to get an older dog. If you REALLY want a pup, the absolute youngest I would recommend is 4 months. By this age they're mostly sleeping through the night without needing potty breaks, they have all their shots so they can go walking, and they're old enough to consider spay/neuter so they could go to daycare. Before 4 months, your options for puppy care are severely limited and would likely be very expensive.

I know she will get easier as she grows, but since my life is so in flux I can't help but think it's just going to be a series of issues that will need solutions and I don't know that I will be able to adequately provide them. If it was only one or two things I was concerned about, it might be easier, but it's a combination of factors that seems to be making this exceptionally difficult. If I had even one thing about this situation that I knew was stable I would at least have something to lean on. If I do go back to school I have no idea how much time I would have for her and she would probably have to be in an apartment. I can train her for these things of course, and ask for help, or hire a dog walker. There are options for any situation.
