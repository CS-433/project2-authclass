This simulation work is done on the CPU. This means that in order to figure out how capable your CPU is for gaming, you need to make the CPU load the dominant factor. The only way to achieve this is by minimizing the amount of work your GPU has to do, an easy way for which is to dial back resolution. It is a way to artificially create a CPU bottleneck.\n\nThe reason this makes sense is future games. You don't possess future games yet that may load the CPU more heavily, but you want to predict how capable each chip is to one another regardless.\n\nThere are of course other, more relevant loads they could choose. Emulation would be a great one. The issue with emulators though is that they're prone to subtle regressions, they can be unstable, configuring them correctly can be tricky, and their developers often do very (vertically) deep optimizations, which can throw a massive wrench into comparisons, as they won't have things optimized for newer SKUs on launch day.\n\nOther than that, the difference between CPUs is often negligible. I'm about to upgrade from an i5 4440 to an i5 13600KF, and I'm reasonably sure I'll barely feel a difference, other than in perhaps compatibility (Win 10 and 11 will be fine now).

It's reserved for very serious software or hardware faults, where continuing execution is either not possible or hazardous (for data integrity).\n\nSince the kernel and the various other first party kernelspace components are rather battle-tested as you can imagine, the very vast majority of time a BSoD will be caused by two reasons:\n\n- bad hardware (most usually RAM, then a bad overclock or degraded silicon),\n\n- bad drivers.\n\nIt is so likely that it's a memory problem in fact, that if you experienced BSoDs recently, you may as well immediately stop reading further, grab [TestMem5](https://testmem.tz.ru/testmem5.htm) (bottom of the page), grab [Anta777's config for it](https://www.overclock.net/threads/official-intel-ddr4-24-7-memory-stability-thread.1569364/page-930#post-28877388) and run it until completion (should take about an hour or so total, has 3 rounds). If you see any more than 0 errors, your memory overclock or your memory altogether is scuffed, and you need to replace it ASAP.\n\nThe second case involving bad drivers is rare these days (on Windows), but may still happen. I unfortunately don't have too much experience how to find the dud, sorry. You'll need to replace the offending driver, and ensure Windows Update doesn't overwrite it with another, possibly crashy one.\n\nFinally, if you want to actually check what happened, open Event Viewer. There, under Windows Logs > System you can find all \"Critical\" events. Among the details of these critical events, you'll find the so called bugcheck code and bugcheck parameters (all of these are hexadecimal numbers). If you simply do a web search for \"bugcheck <code> msdn\" you'll be pointed towards Microsoft's appropriate documentation page, where they'll explain with surprising accessibility what went wrong. You can also use the error string shown on the BSoD screen you got instead.\n\n(\\*) The jab at Linux (users) was to accentuate that both of these issues will also crash Linux for you, and you won't even get a pretty blue message about it. It will just lock up and log the necessary. You won't know where that's put any better, and you won't be able to troubleshoot them any more easily either.

Once you involve yourself as an actor in the play so to speak, you'll be **perceptually** done wrong and you'll be in the right for thinking that. And that's all that matters, since we're running this theater for ourselves.\n\n> If it\u2019s meant to be and always was going to be, how can we hold, for example, murderers accountable?\n\nThis is gonna be a bit on the nose from me, but the same way we do right now. Now if you ask how fair such judgements are, we aren't able to reprimand the world, so your best bet is pinning it on the perpetrator. Is that fair? It's a good question, and I think depending on the circumstances, it's as fair as it gets.\n\nSpecifically for crimes, we're only able to hold people accountable to the extent it is effective. A good way to give this a decent shake is considering Nazi Germany. Can you punish an entire country's worth of people? No. There's a joke over there, and I'll paraphrase very poorly, that \"it's always someone else's grandpa who was a nazi\". Some crimes go unpunished, because they grew so big, they become a historical fact, rather than something effectively punishable.\n\nOn a bit lighter note, consider a showstopper mishap at some major digital infrastructure company, like AWS. Who gets blamed, the intern that caused it or the various teams for not implementing durable enough procedures? Thankfully, we're living the world where it's the latter these days. They (Amazon and many other tech companies) recognized that while the individual intern may have triggered the fallout, it was ultimately a more systemic issue, a lack of proper procedure, authorization and/or training that facilitated it. Same idea. And if it wasn't that intern, it would have been another - it's a matter of time.\n\nSo many examples of this across life: from gun policy or social welfare to nuclear reactor incidents or computer security. We really aren't anything special, I believe - I see ourselves as highly developed biological machines, with in some cases exceptional, and in some other cases exceptionally poor capabilities. No reason not to consider ourselves deterministically operating as a result. Deterministically in the context of our circumstances (just like a computer).\n\n**Edit:** in the case of the excess crimes that were possibly committed due to [leaded gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis), who would you consider responsible for those crimes? The scientists and entrepreneurs who introduced the additive, the individuals committing the crimes, or the world itself for enabling the scientists working on the problem discovering this additive as the first viable compound? It's a very complex question, but given the circumstances, this was just going to happen exactly as is. I don't believe any of this happened on \"chance\", unless you consider the particular circumstances aligning this way the work of chance itself - and I don't see that being too fruitful.\n\n> What is your stance on the induction problem if I may ask?\n\nYou well may ask, but I'm not familiar with the problem, and a cursory search offered results that are too difficult for me to comprehend this sleep deprived.

In the process, I'll define the various terms you were missing, hope that helps.\n\n> rational person\n\nNo such thing exists, rationality is context-sensitive and subjective.\n\n> no free will results in fatalism and meaninglessness\n\nI struggle(d) with these thoughts from time to time, but I'm starting to internalize how this is demonstrably not true. People observing themselves in their own lives (which is how I define consciousness) forms a recursive dynamic, and the depth that they're willing to run that recursion for is what I consider to form a person's individual agency (what people would generally refer to as free will).\n\nBut that is not genuinely \"free\" as its name would suggest - if anything, the term itself to me is nonsense; being impartial when it comes to a choice means selecting randomly, which forgoes it being a will - therefore, when you make a willful choice, it has to be biased, meaning it'll be based on something, meaning it will be predictable, thus deterministic.\n\nYou'll notice however that said individual agency gives birth to individual liability and responsibility. Given enough prediction skills though, this would still result in deterministic behavior being observed. It's just not the level you as the individual are capable of controlling. It's not even very unique in that sense, there are countless other things like this, and I'm reasonably sure this is what people suggest by free will being an illusion.\n\nAnd that's what applies to my fatalistic thoughts as well. Rather than feeling like everything is pointless, it feels more like torture - I'm put in this game, and no matter what I do, I still remain within its boundaries, playing by its rules. No matter how smart I think I am, how special I think I act, I'm still within predictability. I'm just varying who's capable of predicting me and in what ways - racing against the world, in a sense, while entertaining myself like a kid in a sandbox.\n\nAnd unfortunately, no matter how long I've been reflecting on this, I keep getting this very same answer. This is not what fatalism is however. This also doesn't have to result in despair, though if there is any already in there, it's certainly not gonna help with it (my case).\n\n> but isn't it arrogant to think\n\nWhether something is arrogant to think or not doesn't have a bearing on the theory's truth value. Pondering it is also practically an ad hominem against oneself.\n\n> are well-enough understood to conclude that we have no free will\n\nThis feels like a strawman - I wasn't saying a conclusion can be made about the topic, or that that'd be the conclusion that will ultimately win out. It is my belief that it will, but I don't wish it on anyone to have to argue with my beliefs, as that's a fool's errand (as it is always, like I alluded way above). I'd rather argue about specific concepts, findings, experiments that inform the given belief of mine.\n\n> Or doesn't it seem crazy to use natural science\n\nI couldn't make sense of this paragraph, sorry. I can see that it's an appeal to the supernatural, but I can't make heads and tails of it beyond that. There are limits to how much we can learn about our world (observability), but to go for the supernatural just obscures probing attempts, like always.

But at the same time it also sounds like it preempts your questions?\n\nIn my interpretation of these terms, this doesn't really check out to be honest, so it just doesn't work out. I define consciousness as something having a concept of their own internal state - due to information theory limitations, this would mean possessing a compressed version of one's internal state, and continously taking it into consideration.

They frequently (exclusively?) post news articles full of drivel, without the writers' name disclosed.\n\nThese news organizations lose on court way more frequently than their oppositional counterparts too, [even when adjusted to the number of cases](https://atlatszo.hu/kozugy/2022/02/23/kozel-400-pert-vesztett-5-ev-alatt-a-fidesz-barat-media-ebbol-103-at-az-origo-bukott/) (article in Hungarian). Of course that doesn't really matter when their corrections barely reach anyone, and the damage is already long done.\n\n> But the elections itself sound fair and democratic.\n\nApart from the extremely heavy media influence, it was ran fairly decently indeed, in good part thanks to all the volunteers. But the very heavy media presence arguably makes or breaks elections. I think this is an established and common sense enough claim to make by now.\n\nNot covered in the Freedom House report is their spendings on social media ads. They've spent an insane amount on running ads on YouTube and Facebook for example prior to the elections (and the opposition's pre-elections). Literally every single video from them was complete drivel, and you'd get them basically every single time you'd watch a YouTube video. It was beyond excessive.\n\nHis party would also very heavily campaign with the opposition's leader wanting to send people to Ukraine to fight, which was of course also extremely misleading to untrue. The opposition's leader's actual stance was that he'd cooperate with NATO in this conflict completely, and *if that* meant sending soldiers to the frontlines, *then* he'd do so. Naturally, this was a freebie, and they ran away with an out-of-context clip happily.\n\n> In my view a true populist is someone that promises unrealistic things that sound good, but that anyone with knowledge know is bullshit.\n\nTo give you an example, he's been promising on maintaining the utility cost reductions, unlike the opposition's leader, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the very foreseeable and wide economic ramifications of that. They just broke that promise, hence the article above.\n\nThey also engage in a lot of sham measures. One such example would be price caps on fuel and various food items, while also mandating those items to be put on shelves - bankrupting smaller gas stations and shops. Another would be added taxes for multinational companies, which then proceeded to nigh immediately pass them down to the customer.", "created_utc": "1657825621.0", "edited": "1657827443.0", "id": "ig5yl6q", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vyt5z3", "parent_id": "t1_ig5tu7e", "score": "4", "subreddit": "europe", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j"}, {"author": "nitrohigito", "body": "In free, [questionably democratic](https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/freedom-world/2022) and [significantly unfair](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-hungarys-election-a-dismal-day-for-democracy) elections, following a tremendous rain of lies and drivel with record spendings.\n\nWould you prefer populist?\n\n**Edit:** just checked definitions just to make sure I'm not saying something silly - I'll concede on him being an autocrat.

Not sure if this is an actual confusion or just poor wording, but not the whole URL maps to an IP, only the domain. And it's perhaps a bit fallacious to say that the domain has an IP in this context - the domain is associated with an IP, but the IP belongs to either the web server or the load balancer instead. This association is what has to be resolved by your phone for example, and for that we have a protocol called DNS (domain name system).\n\nEven further complication will be when you find out networks are hierarchical, so your phone actually only really gets a private IP address, and then that is mapped to a public one by your router.
