Saying _gustar_ means \u201cis pleasing to\u201d is, strictly speaking, correct, but doesn\u2019t help, because who the hell talks that way.  _A mi me gust\u00f3 el helado._ \u201cTo me to me was pleasing the ice cream.\u201d Yeah, no. (_A mi me_ is \u201cto me to me\u201d). Of course that sentence has OVS word order because why not.\n\n_a_ personal. To say \u201cshe washed the baby\u2019s face\u201d in Spanish, you say _Ella le lav\u00f3 la cara al beb\u00e9_. Given that _le_ = _to him or her_, _al_ = _to the_, that works out literally to something like, \u201cShe to him the face washed to the baby.\u201d  This is what they mean when they say don\u2019t translate from one language to another in your head.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t wash your face, you wash your self the face. \n\nArbitrary reflexive verbs. You don\u2019t just laugh, you laugh yourself (_Me rio/Me estoy riendo_). If you want to say that you\u2019re laughing at yourself, you have to say you laugh yourself of yourself _Me estoy riendo de m\u00ed mismo_. There are a bunch of these, and I can never remember what they are. So I just use the verbs wrong and look like a dope.\n\nMy wife insists that spelling is more difficult in Spanish and English, because _x_ is pronounced in so many ways, and _j, g_ and _h_ sound the same except when they don\u2019t. Ok, but _rough, cough, ought, bough, though, through, and thorough_, and that\u2019s just one example. Sorry, English wins the shitty orthography trophy.\n\nWords that differ only in accent. _Quieres ir al cine?_ _Si tu quieres, s\u00ed_. There\u2019s a whole bunch of those, too.\n\nSubjunctive mood. We have it in English, but it\u2019s dying. (If I hear \u201cIt\u2019s important that you are on time\u201d again, I\u2019m going to jump out a window.) \n\n_ojal\u00e1 que_ as far as I know, always used with subjunctive. It\u2019s sort of means \u201cI hope\u201d, or maybe better, \u201chopefully\u201d, since \u201cI hope\u201d implies there is someone who is hoping.\n\nThere\u2019s probably a bunch more, but that\u2019s what comes to mind on short notice.", "created_utc": "1666315270.0", "edited": "1666413269.0", "id": "it5ca1u", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y91fvl", "parent_id": "t3_y91fvl", "score": "16", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "elucify", "body": ">\the didn\u2019t want to scare/lose me. \n\nWell, guess what.\n\nWhat an asshole.\n\n>\tWhich to me seems like he was manipulating me this whole time into falling in love with him so he could marry me.\n\n\u201cSeems\u201d LOL\n\n>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting cause he said every guy does this. \n\nHe\u2019s been lying to you this whole time about himself, but not about this?

(I) The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, **with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.**\n\nSec. 2 (3) No slave or other person held to service or labor in any State or Territory of the Confederate States, under the laws thereof, escaping or lawfully carried into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but **shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such slave belongs**,. or to whom such service or labor may be due.\n\nSec. 3 (3) The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several Sates; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form States to be admitted into the Confederacy.

Alexander Stephens, vice president of the confederacy, in [a speech about the formation of the confederacy](https://www.americanyawp.com/reader/the-civil-war/alexander-stephens-on-slavery-and-the-confederate-constitution-1861/) 1861:\n\n>\tOur new Government is founded\u2026 upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition. [Applause.] This, our new Government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth\u2026. The negro by nature, or by the curse against Canaan, is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system\u2026 \n\nAnd this\n\n>\tLawrence Keitt, Congressman from South Carolina, in a speech to the House on January 25, 1860: \"African slavery is the corner-stone of the industrial, social, and political fabric of the South; and whatever wars against it, wars against her very existence. Strike down the institution of African slavery and you reduce the South to depopulation and barbarism.\" Later in the same speech he said, \"The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States.\" \n\nAnd this from James H. Hammond, Congressman from South Carolina, in a speech before Congress:\n    \n>\tthe moment this House undertakes to legislate upon this subject [slavery], it dissolves the Union. Should it be my fortune to have a seat upon this floor, I will abandon it the instant the first decisive step is taken looking towards legislation of this subject. I will go home to preach, and if I can, practice, disunion, and civil war, if needs be. A revolution must ensue, and this republic sink in blood.\n\nThe Confederate Constitution did not need to address the causes of secession from the United States. Its purpose was to form a social contract, not to explain why that contract needed to exist.\n\nBut the words of the people who seceded clearly show that the primary reason for separation from the Union was to protect the institution of \u201cNegro slavery\u201d.\n\nStill don\u2019t believe it? Well read what the seceding states themselves said about why they were seceding, in the documents where they officially does so.\n\nFrom the **Declaration of Causes of Seceding States**, by state, 1861:\n\nhttps://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states\n\n**Georgia**\n\nThe people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.\n\n**Mississippi**\n\nA Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union. \n\nIn the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.\n\nOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. \n\n**South Carolina**\n\n\u2026\n\nThe right of property in slaves was recognized [in the US Constitution]  by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.\n\nWe affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.\n\n*Texas*\n\n\u2026\n\nTexas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people\u2026 She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time\u2026\n\nWe hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.\n\nThat in this free government *all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights* [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations\n\n*Virginia*\n\nThe people of Virginia, in their ratification of the Constitution of the United State\u2026 having declared that the powers granted under the said Constitution were derived from the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensoever the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression; and the Federal Government, having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but *to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.* \n\nWithout exception, each one of these documents, in discussing the Confederacy, distinguishes themselves as slaveholding states versus non-slaveholding states. That was the primary division in their minds. No other distinction is made anywhere, except complaints Republican party and its unwillingness to enforce the proslavery prescriptions of the US Constitution at the time.\n\nSee also Chandra Manning\u2019s _What This Cruel War Was Over_, which show from primary sources that the soldiers fighting on both sides agreed on what they were fighting about: slavery.\n\nTL;DR The claim that the Civil War was not first and foremost about slavery is *revisionist bullshit*. Even if it what they teach in public schools in southern states (where people are proud enough of their heritage to fly the Stars and Bars, but not proud enough to be honest about what it meant to those who killed and died for it.)

So Russian o does not exactly equal, say, American English o (in pot), but when you see it written, and are even _told_ it's the same, it's hard to learn to finesse the fine difference later. I'm a big fan of starting with an audio-only program like Pimsleur first, before any literacy, for that reason.

Now learning Russian, a whole other ballgame, at the age of 60. So no, you're not one and done at 20. Unless you're exceptional, though, you can probably give up on the idea of having a native accent. But that doesn't matter a bit, really it doesn't.\n\nI already spoke French from High School. That made it somewhat easier because I already understood most conjugations and moods (except subjunctive, I got that in Spanish), as well as gender and number agreement, the typical Western Indo-European grammar stuff. So I have internalized some of the rules. I think German is a bit harder than the Romance languages because of the case inflections. English has a massive vocabulary, so there are many cognates from both Latin and Germanic roots (either via Norman French in the former case, or Anglo-Saxon or Old Norse in the latter).

The most over-the-top sycophant with the most outrageous demand wins. Everyone shouts \u201camen!\u201d at the end of each prayer.\n\nSome of the costumes: Amish, pro-lifers, even a clinic bomber.

Another guy shows up with six \u201cwives\u201d, you know who: Mormons!\n\nOf course then Devil makes a guest appearance, and she\u2019s a stripper. Jesus shows up at the end of her dance, wearing a plastic crown of thorns and a bloody robe, and spanks her bare ass while shouting that she\u2019s \u201cso naughty\u201d. When he finally chases her out the door, who\u2019s there? Santa Claus, to lead everybody to sing Happy Birthday to Jesus. Then the lights drop, and Santa, Satin (that\u2019s the stripper\u2019s name Satin, get it?) and Jesus pull everyone out on the dance floor, as the DJ spins a mix of Church hymns redone as rave music. The snacks are baguettes and wine served in plastic gold chalices, and napkins are real Bible pages.

Focusing on addiction instead of on substances is only victim blaming if you consider addiction to be a moral failing instead of a disease. Treating addiction as a moral failing is one of the reasons it\u2019s so difficult to treat\u2014it\u2019s cruel, ignorant, and counterproductive.\n\nIt\u2019s also an easy trap to fall into, because so much of the damage caused by addiction comes from the addict\u2019s behavior, which non-addicted people assume to be under their control. One of the virtues of 12 step programs is that it helps the addict stop blaming themselves, and heal the shame that might otherwise drive them back into using.\n\nThe substances (and experiences) are not the problem. The human tendency to form addictions is the problem. The fault lies not in our drinks, but in ourselves. That\u2019s not blaming, it\u2019s just an acknowledgment of a part of human nature that makes life difficult sometimes.\n\nSubstances and experiences have different addictive valence: nicotine is on the high end, rubbing sand in your eyes is on the low end. Likewise, addictions have different consequences for the addicts themselves, for those around them, and for societies.\n\nIt is counterproductive to refuse to acknowledge the differences between different kinds of addiction\u2014substance addiction versus process addiction, the different kinds of harm that flow from each kind of addiction, etc. Without making these distinctions, you cannot reason well about what is and is not effective and economical for public health, and family and individual treatment.\n\n>\t\u201cSmoking doesn\u2019t cause that medical burden.

It won\u2019t be a public health problem, just an individual choice with attendant risks. (Assuming it\u2019s regulated properly: no secondhand smoke for workers, no exposing your kids, etc.)\n\nNobody is making an argument for alcoholism.

Alcoholism does. And the vast majority of drinkers aren\u2019t alcoholics, nor are they on the road to it. Alcoholism is a disease. People need to recognize it for what it is, and societies need to detect and treat it. There us no question that the costs of alcoholism in blood, treasure, and agony are staggering. But the problem is not Demon Rum. It\u2019s addiction.\n\n>Do you defend smoking like this? Or excessive junk food consumption?\n\nAn insightful and fair question. I don\u2019t defend smoking and junk food, but I defend the choice. Nicotine is instructive. It is so much more addictive than alcohol (and heroin even, by some measures) that the question of what choice means is subtle. (As with all addictions in general\u2014that\u2019s where libertarianism fails.) Most nicotine use is addictive, but the blast radius of addictive smoking is narrower.  Most alcohol use is not addictive, but when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s really bad. But, unlike with tobacco, it is usually not a problem.\n\nAs for junk food, our conversation has inspired me to look into the social costs of obesity\u2014more or less than alcohol? I\u2019m curious. But if obesity has higher health costs, then what? No more croissants because orphans and skyrocketing insurance costs?\n\nI think public policy on addictions should focus on harm reduction, not prohibitionism, religious orthodoxy, or anti-hedonic moral panic. (None of which am I accusing you.) And it should be appropriate to the problem. The social problems are caused by addiction, not by the substances or experiences themselves.\n\n>\tHerron is fun\n\nNot for long. Most people who use heroin develop dependence.

People need to know real risks.

Educated speakers, even monolinguals, can usually correct your mistakes for you in their heads and understand what you meant. Whereas those who are not often exposed to minor grammatical mistakes and odd pronunciations will often will be flummoxed by even the simplest errors.\n\nExample: I once asked someone if they had seen my \u201cbilletero\u201d. Blank stare. The word for \u201cwallet\u201c is _billetera_, but the listener wasn\u2019t used to those kinds of mistakes, so no dice. _Billetero_ isn\u2019t even a word, except in certain countries, where it\u2019s the guy selling lottery tickets. Though, again, most sophisticated speakers could probably guess the meaning from context.\n\nOf course, the better you speak, the better you sound, and you don\u2019t say things that are just unintelligible. Listeners vary in their error correction skills. You actually learn more from the people who understand you less, because you have to try harder, and they can often correct your mistake. (A ten-year-old Maya girl rolling her eyes at your misconjugation is something that sticks with you.)\n\nThe WhiteChocolateLab\u2019s final point is the most important one. You\u2019re going to make mistakes.
