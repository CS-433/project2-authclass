These are obviously important skills so I do put effort into this. My other class like this is basically an intro to clinical work.

Research is fun for me so I put all of my effort into that. I actually give very little shits about my coursework lol. I do the bare minimum for my classes bc they TRULY do not matter as much as research and clinical work. Being a grad student is all about learning where to focus your efforts and where not to.

You are responsible for the well-being of your clients so there is no excuse for slacking.\n\nI know that in the second year clinical responsibilities pick up and shit really hits the fan in terms of workload. Classes, research, clinical work, and applying for externships. That goes on up until you graduate pretty much.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify what I mean about not caring about my coursework. In undergrad, I just NEEDED to get As. Like all that mattered was the grade. Now, I can actually get a B and it really doesn\u2019t matter. I focus on getting what I need out of my classes.

First, there are some religions that are like this. For example, to be a Muslim requires an unquestioning and dogmatic allegiance to the Quran, which is understood to be the literal word of Allah. As that guy in the debate said the other day, if Allah commanded porn to be good, he would think porn is ok. Second, I think that many \"religious\" people believe that what it means to be religious is to be allegiant to a supernatural being in an uncritical fashion. You see this with almost all Christians. Most Christians have zero clue why they believe the things that their religion tell them to believe.\n\nHowever, Christianity at its core is not about an irrational subservience. In fact, Christianity holds that humans have the freedom to follow Jesus or not, and their choice has no bearing on their value as a human being. What ruins religions like Christianity is not Christianity itself, but rather people being dangerously dumb in interpreting it.\n\n(2) That Christianity isn't based.\n\nLike I said, it's Christians that make Christianity bad. At its core, Christianity is literally socialism. That's right, Jesus was the first socialist theorist. Even if you don't believe in the metaphysical claims of Christianity (which I don't), I think that everyone should take Jesus's teachings to heart. At the end of the day, being Christlike should be the goal for all of us lefties.\n\n(3) That Christianity is not the root of modern social justice (not sure Vaush ever talked about this, but it is an issue in atheist discourse)\n\nNietzsche was the only true atheist. Nietzsche called out Christianity for what it actually is: a movement concerned with the suffering of victims. Nietzsche fundamentally disagreed that we should care for the oppressed, but he correctly identified that the reason why so many of us do care is because of 2000 years of Christianity. Prior to Christianity, no one gave a single fuck about advocating for marginalized groups. And yes, Christians notoriously have genocided the fuck out of various populations. But the Christian concern for victims, as an idea, has infiltrated our collective consciousness for the past 2000 years and dramatically changed our worldview as a species. Ren\u00e9 Girard writes extensively on this in his mimetic theory; he writes specifically on how Christianity is an anti-religion that abolished human sacrifice and exposed the scapegoating of marginalized individuals  (it's too much to get into here but an incredible theory).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Religion inherently is not bad, it is people who follow religion that make it bad.

According to act utilitarianism, we examine the morality of an action based on the consequences of that action alone. Thus, it is possible that under act utilitarianism we can certainly justify imperialism or the exploitation of natural resources.\n\nRule utilitarianism, by contrast, posits that actions are good or bad insofar as they adhere to certain. These rules are established such that if followed, they are meant to produce the greatest good for the greatest number. Say we establish a moral rule that states that imperialism or the exploitation of natural resources should be prohibited. Why would we do so? Well of course, a single act of imperialism or exploitation can produce good. However, if everyone started to engage in such behaviors shit would hit the fan very quickly. Thus, a rule functions to prohibit these actions wholesale in an effort to prevent a sort of slippery slope. \n\nHopefully that makes sense. Strict act utilitarianism can be dangerous and goes against the moral sensibilities of most people. Rule utilitarianism, in my opinion, preserves the positives of a deontological system without making any appeals to metaphysical truths. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to talk about in regards to these topics, but hopefully this briefly summarizes some of it.\n\nI would check out the Wikipedia pages on these topics if you\u2019re interested.", "created_utc": "1657139544.0", "edited": "False", "id": "if4blax", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vsywku", "parent_id": "t3_vsywku", "score": "1", "subreddit": "VaushV", "subreddit_id": "t5_10to4u"}, {"author": "notblackmachete", "body": "Well not necessarily.

But you\u2019re probably better off. \n\nI think I also have an interesting story. Started dating my ex when I was alt-right. She was a lib but not a leftie. Because of dating her, I moved to the left and then eventually to the far left due to other influences. She\u2019s Black and bi so those aspects of her identity helped me develop a lot of empathy me being a straight white dude. Nevertheless, she broke up with me, and she said that she did so partially because she held resentment for me for being a former right winger. Fast forward a few months after the break up. SHE STARTS DATING A LIBERTARIAN. That doesn\u2019t last long until they break up and then she STARTS DATING A TRUMPTARD. I\u2019m still on good terms with her and we chat sometimes. But guess what, now whenever we talk politics she just defends the Republican Party and tells me how democrats are just as dangerous as republicans. Keep in mind, this is an extraordinarily smart woman. Like one of the smartest I\u2019ve ever met.

Grass fragments, dust, pollen, too-dry substrate, or a myriad of tiny foreign objects can cause nasal inflammation. Initially not life-threatening, it cannot be ignored either.  \n\n\nSymptomatically, the animal continues to behave healthily and most often maintains a daily routine. In other words, it will eat, drink, browse and snuggle down in a favorite spot. However, there will be signs that something is wrong. At times, the tortoise will be uncomfortable and bothered, especially when the offending piece is a longish piece of grass. To find relief, it might attempt to wipe its nose with a front leg. Needless to say, Leopards don't have fingers to do the job properly and need their owner's assistance to remove whatever is in there.  \n\n\nThe bubbles are a result of irritation of the nasal membrane and if the cause is not dealt with, an infection might ensue.
