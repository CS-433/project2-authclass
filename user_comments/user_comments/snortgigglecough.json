I actually *love unreliable, shitty narrators* \\- that's why I read horror. One of my favorite books of all time is American Psycho, and holy shit is that MC a piece of shit.\n\nThat's the thing I am trying to state here - Pessl used racist stereotypes in a fully unexamined way. Here's a passage for an example, which I want to note if this was the *only example* of an over-stereotypical description of a POC in the text, maybe I would give it a pass but it is one in a sea of other examples. Sure, we can say that his dialogue and description are shaded through the MC's lens, but I would argue that if this was the case it goes thoroughly unexamined and is therefore a failure. Now you may not find anything wrong with this type of character description, but I found it pretty grating, from the accented speech to literal walking stereotype of a taxi driver:\n\n\u201cFuck, man,\u201d said the taxi driver, \u201c**you scared the shit outta me. I thought you were here to deport me.**\u201d He cackled with laughter,  **revealing a set of blinding white teeth, a few capped in gold**. **He  scratched his red-and-yellow Rasta cap as he studied Ashley\u2019s picture.**\n\n\u201cYah, sure. I did pick her up here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cCoupla weeks ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat color coat was she wearing?\u201d interjected Nora.\n\nHe thought it over, rubbing the gray stubble on his  chin.\n\n\u201cGreenish brown? But I\u2019m color-blind, man.\u201d He called himself Zeb. He was black \u2014 from Jamaica, I  guessed from his slight accent\u201466, lean yet disheveled and slouched, like a palm tree after a mild hurricane.\n\nDuring the past hour, as Nora and I waited, we\u2019d  managed to stitch together some basic information. He came to Golden Way five nights a week for dinner. He ate outside, leaning against the hood of his cab, **playing loud music with the windows unrolled**, and then took off, doubtlessly  resuming his all-night driving shift, which ended at 7:00 A.M.\n\n\u201cWhen I got here,\u201d Zeb went on, scratching his head,  \u201cshe was in da back talkin\u2019 to da old lady. I got my dinner. She followed me  outside.\u201d \u201cAnd you drove her somewhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cYah.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember where?\u201d He thought it over. \u201cSome big-ass house on the Upper East.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you take us there now?\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cDa stops and starts all  bleed together when you drive.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll pay you,\u201d blurted Nora.He perked up.\u201cYou\u2019ll pay da meter?\u201d Nora nodded.\n\n\u201cOkay. Sure. We can do that.\u201dGrinning, as if he couldn\u2019t believe his luck, Zeb  cheerfully grabbed a foam container and began to load it with noodles, egg rolls, sesame chicken \u2014 if it *was* chicken; **the gray meat looked like the** ***siopao*** **or** ***cat in a steamed bun*** **I\u2019d once eaten by accident  in Hong Kong**. ***Astonishing how quickly money jogged a man\u2019s memory.*** Nora and I headed outside to wait.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be *expensive,*\u201d I muttered,  squinting farther down Market Street, where a lone man was shuffling toward us.\n\nInstantly I recognized the gray wool coat and the cigarette.\n\nIn no time,  the three of us were tearing up Park Avenue crammed into the backseat of a taxi  with a steering wheel covered in blue shag and **a rearview mirror wearing more  gold chains than Mr. T.** I leaned forward to study Zeb\u2019s picture ID \u2014 his full  name was Zebulaniah Akpunku \u2014 noticing a worn-out paperback, *Steppin\u2019 Into  the Good Life,* on the passenger seat beside him.\n\n\u201cDid you notice anything unusual about the girl?\u201d I  asked Zeb through the bulletproof window.\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cShe was a white girl. They all kinda  look alike.\u201d He guffawed happily, quieting only to take a bite of his food.\n\n\u201cDid she talk to you? Anything you can tell us  about her?\u201d\u201cNo way, man. I got one rule as a driver.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cNever look in da rearview mirror.\u201d *\u201cNever?\u201d* We drifted into the left-hand lane,  cutting off a cab. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy to keep a\u2019 watchin\u2019 what you  leavin\u2019 behind.\u201d\n\nTen minutes later, we were weaving our way up and  down every street in the East Sixties between Madison and Lexington. The meter ticked from twenty dollars to thirty, *forty.*\n\n**\u201cOh, yeah,** ***dis*** \\*\\*is right,\u201d Zeb would say,  leaning forward to scrutinize the quiet rows of townhouses until he\u2019d reach the  end of the block. \u201c\\*\\****Shit.*** **I got it wrong.\u201d**\n\n**He\u2019d sigh in apparent  frustration, then cheerfully help himself to more sesame chicken. \u201cNo worries,  man. It\u2019s da next block.\u201d**\n\n**But the same thing happened on the next block.**  ***And the next.*** **After another fifteen minutes, the meter was $60.25.**  Nora was gnawing her fingernails, and Hopper hadn\u2019t said a word the entire ride,  slumped against the seat, staring out the window. I was about to call it off when, as we were cruising  down East Seventy-first, Zeb abruptly slammed on the brakes. *\u201cDat\u2019s it!\u201d*\n\nHe was indicating a building on  our left. It sat entirely in the dark, a massive townhouse that  looked more like an embassy than a residence \u2014 pale gray limestone, twenty-five  feet wide. It was weathered and run-down, dead leaves strewn across the front  steps, the double doors littered with takeout menus \u2014 a sure indication no one  had been there for weeks.\n\n\u201cWe already drove down here,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to happen, but I don\u2019t tell her that.\n\nThey say the world has gone to shit, but I\u2019m counting myself among the lucky ones. Every morning around the coffee machine they give us granola bars, and once or twice a week there are some snacks for us to try at lunch. From what I\u2019ve heard, some of my old friends\u2019 jobs don\u2019t even go this far, and they\u2019re stuck pinching quarters from the cash register to buy a donut for lunch.\n\nI can\u2019t tell my mom, but I\u2019m saving money for the first time in my life.\n\nI stopped paying rent around the same time everyone else did. We all saw the news, mass evictions were coming and with wages stagnant, it just made sense to stop paying. The streets are now bursting with the remnants of this decision - but not me. They always told me I was gifted for a reason, right?\n\nSee, one of the first things I do when I get a job - I\u2019ve done this since before I had a real understanding of why - is to explore every nook of the building. You should always know every escape route - my Uncle Joe taught me that - and I make it my business to memorize them before the end of the first week. On every lunch break, I\u2019ll shake hands and share coffee with the custodians and they let me roam the back hallways to my heart\u2019s content.\n\nI\u2019ve gotta tell you, this job takes the cake. On one of those walks, I found a small door that led into a clean, fully finished crawl space. I don\u2019t think anyone else even knows it was there. But I knew exactly what this meant - no more rent.\n\nI\u2019ve been living here for around three months now, and this is a *way* better deal than my college dorm was. The building\u2019s gym has showers, I\u2019ve been losing weight, and I\u2019ve even been able to get a date or two. Sure, I can\u2019t bring anyone home, but let\u2019s just say the money I\u2019ve saved has raised my confidence through the roof.\n\nPeople ask questions - of course, they notice I\u2019m the first one into the office and the last one to leave - but I think they just assume I\u2019m the hardest working person in the office. It\u2019s kinda funny - at this point, I\u2019m not even sure what my job *is* beyond looking at my email every fifteen minutes.\n\nYeah, I know. I have it made.\n\nI am starting to get a little worried. Gwen from Floor 4, she\u2019s been looking at me funny. I don\u2019t see her much (I\u2019m a Floor 5er), but sometimes after work, I\u2019ll see her lingering near our cafeteria. At first, I thought maybe she\u2019s stealing leftovers (we all do it from time to time), but now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\n\\--\n\nTonight, I swear I heard a noise coming from underneath the floorboards when I was trying to sleep. This is *my home*, and I have a duty to protect it from any squatting ne'er-do-wells.\n\nI went downstairs, and lo-n\u2019-behold I find a nearly identical crawlspace to my own down on Floor 4. And who do I find there? None other than Gwen, a couch, and a brand new Xbox hooked up to an impossibly large projector screen. I couldn\u2019t wrap my mind around how she got half the stuff crammed in her room.\n\nShe seemed unperturbed by my presence, and all I saw was her grin illuminated by the light of a game.\n\n\u201cThought you\u2019d find me someday.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\nShe tossed something to me - a work shirt I\u2019d attempted to wash in a bathroom sink.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been here way longer than you.\u201d Her smile widened, and she gestured to   \nthe space next to her on the couch. We started to play.\n\n\\---\n\nGwen and I have spent most nights together, since that day. It\u2019s nice, because we don\u2019t work together, but we get to see each other every evening and neither of us has any questions about our living arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten closer - telling each other our deepest secrets and greatest desires. It\u2019s nice, because Gwen is nice.\n\n\\---\n\nMy mom called again this morning, she asked me when I was going to get married. I think it might happen someday, but I don\u2019t tell her that.\n\n#", "created_utc": "1606611391.0", "edited": "1606613305.0", "id": "gdye6fo", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k2xpwv", "parent_id": "t3_k2xpwv", "score": "15", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb"}, {"author": "snortgigglecough", "body": "I think it was more being nervous about streaming with AOC than anything else...", "created_utc": "1606596584.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gdx72p5", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k2epen", "parent_id": "t1_gdwx40k", "score": "18", "subreddit": "ContraPoints", "subreddit_id": "t5_3hets"}, {"author": "snortgigglecough", "body": "That\u2019s been on my list for a while...

The pandemic had taken its toll on all of us, but the three years of solitary celebrations had left a deep uncertainty about whether our family could survive.\n\nUpon arrival, the warm embrace of cinnamon and roasted turkey carried me into my grandmother\u2019s home, pushing me past the deep unease about bearing my family\u2019s vacant smiles and stilted conversation.\n\nTo my surprise, what I had known before seemed to no longer be true - uncles and aunts spoke freely with younger cousins and sisters, there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to the seating arrangement, and there was a sense of cheer that permeated through each and every eye I met and conversation I partook in. Our gruff patriarch, Grandpa Jonas, had a merry smile on his cheeks and settled in between my two youngest cousins, foregoing his seat at the head of the table, which was taken by the fifteen year old miscreant cousin, Cody.\n\nThere was a freeness in the air - a lightness of being that I had never remembered before at previous gatherings, where terse conversation and decades-old feuds roiled beneath the surface. As the forks and knives scratched our plates, and laughter rolled throughout the room, I felt an unrelenting sense of joy that not only had my family survived - but we were thriving.\n\nWe finished our meal, and Grandmother filled each glass with an amber mead, her eyes meeting mine with a twinkle as she filled mine to the brim.\n\nI clinked my glass, rising from my seat and smiling down at the many faces around me, \u201cWe have all been through so much these past three years, but coming together, I can\u2019t help but say that this has been the most pleasant Thanksgiving I can remember!\u201d Our glasses raised in the air, the smiles widening on the faces around me, their hands holding their own aloft as they watched me take a deep drink of the golden liquid.\n\nMy throat burned, the glass falling to the floor and my legs collapsed. The smiling faces leaned closer as my vision darkened, and I noticed that their teeth were sharper than I remembered, their pupils thinner. As I took my last breath, I realized how wrong I was. I thought my family had survived. No - they had evolved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nI am a new baby at sharing my creative writing so please feel free to give feedback and things.", "created_utc": "1606365268.0", "edited": "1606365724.0", "id": "gdmluvp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_k17ygw", "parent_id": "t3_k17ygw", "score": "1389", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb"}, {"author": "snortgigglecough", "body": "I\u2019m watching this movie right now and this is doubly funny because of just how bad Mark Wahlberg is in this movie.
