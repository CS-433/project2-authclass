Are you saying I need to also file an NR return for 2022? If so, why? I thought that would be unnecessary given the fact that my American assets cease to be under the jurisdiction of the IRS on the day I cease to be a tax resident.\n\nFinally, I haven't 100% figured out what to do with my American assets, but I don't believe that I will be able to buy anything new after I report my change of address to Vanguard.

Do I need a cross-border tax professional for this? I'm prepared to do legwork myself, but I'm finding it difficult to find the relevant tax code sections for this on my own.

For example, how do you translate a knock-knock joke from English into Chinese? You can\u2019t. Knock-knock jokes are cultural, and are usually based on word play that doesn\u2019t have an equivalent in the other language.\n\nGiven this type of problem, one can realize that the purpose of a translator (human or machine) is often to do the best possible job of conveying the intention of the original text/speaker, rather than trying to translate word-for-word, because these equivalents just don\u2019t exist.\n\nIn this case, one could translate \u201cLa casa de papel\u201d word for word into \u201cThe house of paper\u201d. However, if we bear in mind that the job of a translator is to convey the underlying meaning or intention, then there is a predicament: Was the intention to refer to the show, or to translate it directly?\n\nYou can\u2019t know for sure with so little context, so google, or any other translator, has to \u201cguess\u201d. Google may not actually be guessing in any meaningful way, as described in other comments about how it works, but functionally it is, because it only gives one translation out of multiple possibilities.\n\nIn this case, Google is essentially\nguessing that since La casa de papel almost always refers to the show rather than just the phrase itself, it should translate the show name into the English equivalent.

Thus explaining (similarly to other posters) that \"me hubieras...\" is more expressing \"regret\" and \"deber\u00edas...\" is more expressing \"scolding\".\n\nMy contention is that this is a false equivalence. First, saying \"you should have called me\" is perfectly fine in all cases, and the thing that changes how it's perceived is your tone. Second, adding those softening filler words does not do the same thing that \"me hubieras\" does.\n\nIn my eyes, those softening words actually are a nice way of expressing the \"scolding\" version of these phrases. You make it more polite, or make the other party more amenable to your message by tiptoeing around their feelings. \"It would have been nice\", \"not a big deal\" etc, are expressing your preference, and that they didn't take your feelings into account, hence the \"scold\".\n\n\"Me hubieras\" is all about sympathy, no? It's not about \"It would have been nice (for me) if you had...\", and more about \"Too bad!

However, before I took Spanish on italki, I took Chinese and I didn't know about the ratio. Looking back on my Chinese teachers (there were only 5), 4 of them had a ratio <10 and I didn't want to do a repeat lesson with any of them. 1 of them had a ratio >10, and she was the teacher that I ended up taking several lessons with.\n\nYour point about different lesson types is also interesting. For me, I don't think it's particularly relevant because I mostly stay away from anybody who offers lessons like that, because I find they tend to be worse conversationalists. Perhaps either they haven't honed their conversational class skills because they do more of a different kind of class, or they offer different types of classes because they don't feel comfortable running a conversation class.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not trying to find any and all teachers that I might click with, so I'm sure that some of my heuristics may be leaving out excellent candidates from my search. I'm just focused on making sure I find a handful of people that I can come back to repeatedly and feel excited about.\n\nWith my 2 favorite teachers, I actually don't talk that much about what I've been up to. We can have more frequent conversations because we get along more as friends than as strictly teacher/student. Of course, the conversation often starts superficially from a \"what's been going on lately\" but then quickly takes a turn into more interesting subjects. With the teacher I've been with for the longest time, we have a bunch of topics that have come up in our conversations that we want to talk about, but just haven't had the time to discuss yet. Not because they'd be good practice for me, but because they're interesting subjects to discuss in-depth in whatever language with someone you enjoy talking to.\n\nI also tend to only use professional teachers who have 1000+ classes given. These criteria are somewhat arbitrary, but they've worked fairly well for me.\n\nIn the future, I think I will plan to \"take my shot\" with some newer/cheaper teachers once I'm taking even more lessons, and thus have extra space in my italki schedule.

However, if you are that dedicated, a very, very high level is possible, so go for it. Just want to make sure your expectations are appropriately set.\n\nThat said:\n\nHow much time per day do you have to dedicate to your study? Can you afford to pay for private lessons online?\n\nIn my opinion, there are several aspects of study, each which can be accomplished in different ways. To learn most effectively, you probably want to have some amount of each of them.\n\nThese aspects are:\n\n- SF: Speaking practice (fluency)\n- SP: Speaking practice (pronunciation)\n- L: Listening practice\n- R:Reading practice\n- V: Vocab acquisition/retention\n- G: Grammar study\n- W: Writing practice (more optional imo)\n\nHere are some common language learning activities and the aspects they cover:\n\n- Having freeform conversations with a tutor in Spanish, getting them to explain how to say things you want to say but don\u2019t know how as you go. This gets you: SF, L, and to lesser extents SP, V, G. The latter three depend on how you and your teacher operate and what you focus on, but will be there in small doses with any such practice. And you can\u2019t avoid improving your fluency and listening if you have conversations. It\u2019s just not possible, ha! Since this covers so much terrain, I think having conversations with a tutor is by far the best single thing you can do, because it combines input and output in one. However, you can do even better by incorporating other things. You can also look online for a language exchange partner if you want a free but less effective version of this.\n\n- Reading articles that are comprehensible at your current level. This gets you: R, V, and some G.\n\n- Listening to podcasts/watching videos that are comprehensible at your current level. This gets you: L, V, and some G.\n\n- Flashcard review. In my opinion, this is only good as a supplement to one of the above activities. It\u2019s like a vocab-boosting expansion pack. You can also adapt it to help you memorize/internalize grammar patterns, but I find that a little trickier myself. This gets you : V++ if you\u2019re doing other activities that give you a list of words to commit to memory, like reading or conversing with a tutor\n\n- Studying a textbook. This gets you: G, R, V, and maybe some W. Overall, not a bad investment, but unless your textbook consists of tons of listening drills that I haven\u2019t accounted for here, it doesn\u2019t help much with your actual goal of having conversations, since there\u2019s no speaking or listening practice. This is a reasonable supplement if you enjoy it, and may be useful to get a quick base in the language before branching out into other activities.\n\n- Shadowing. This is following along with native audio and mimicking the things they say, trying to sound like them. This gets you: SP. It\u2019s hard to improve your pronunciation without specific attention to it, so I would recommend adding this or something similar into the mix. You can also do some study of Spanish phonetics at the beginning (youtube it) to get a solid base of understanding of how Spanish is supposed to sound.\n\n- Writing a journal or online posts. This gets you: W. Pretty straightforward.\n\n- Recording video/audio of yourself. This gets you: SF, and SP, assuming you listen to yourself. Not a bad thing to do, but not something I do a whole lot.\n\n- Apps. This gets you some combo of: V, G, L, R, depending on how the app is structured. Similar to textbooks. I personally think there are better ways to study, especially if you want to be able to converse. But as a supplement, it\u2019s probably fine if you enjoy it.\n\nPick some combination of those activities that covers all your bases and do them all multiple times per week. You will improve quickly if you do this, but it takes a lot of hard work.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- What I would actually recommend: 3+ conversations per week with native speaking tutors, daily flashcard review of vocab from those sessions, occasional reading, occasional watching, occasional shadowing\n- Cheaper alternative based on input: Daily reading, daily watching, daily flashcards from input sources, occasional conversation with tutor or language exchange partners. You will end up worse at speaking, but you\u2019ll be able to understand a hell of a lot, and may improve quickly once you have more opportunities to speak.\n- Whatever other combo you want\n\nHope that helps!", "created_utc": "1601399229.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g72xqch", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_j21cw3", "parent_id": "t3_j21cw3", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Spanish", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qtt1"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "Es tu problema con un curso el dinero que cuesta o el tiempo que toma?

The zhhhhh sound you were making is probably actually correct and you don\u2019t realize it, because that\u2019s exactly what it sounds like.\n\nA confounding factor is that there are many different ways that the pinyin r is actually realized by native speakers, including some that sound a lot like English r\u2019s or some that sound like l\u2019s or y\u2019s. But the zhhhhh sound that\u2019s produced as the voiced version of the sh sound is the base sound and then it varies depending on slight positioning adjustments that native speakers make depending on their accents.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what I mean by affricate vs fricative, an affricate is where you build up pressure behind the sound and then start to cause vibration, as in pinyin zh or ch. You can kind of hold the pressure in anticipation and then release it to start the sound. Contrast this with the fricative versions r and sh, the sound just starts without any pressure buildup. ch/sh in English as well shows this distinction. ch is the affricate and sh is the fricative, and the only thing that makes those two sounds different is whether or not there\u2019s a small interruption/pressure buildup beforehand (ch) or not (sh).\n\nIf you really feel weird about how that sounds, and you don\u2019t like it, you can try to relax/drop/flatten your tongue from that position a little bit to try to make it less \u201cbuzzy\u201d and more like a familiar r. But in my opinion, that\u2019s a modification to a more \u201cstandard\u201d pinyin r which really is the same as the zhhhhh sound you discovered by adding voicing the sh sound, but which may not fit your conception of what it is because the English r sound is quite different than the pinyin r, or perhaps because the accents that you\u2019re used to pronounce r somewhat different to what I\u2019ve described here.\n\nAnd yes, for me the lips/tongue/mouth/teeth position is all EXACTLY the same, and the only difference is the voicing.\n\nThat\u2019s a total braindump, but hopefully it helps!", "created_utc": "1599518212.0", "edited": "False", "id": "g4dw8zy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_inso8d", "parent_id": "t1_g4doov7", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "Don\u2019t think of it like an r.

Or \u5c04 and \u70ed. Pronounced exactly the same except for the additional voicing on the initial of \u70ed.\n\nOne drill you can do is to continuously hold a sh sound, and then to toggle between unvoiced and voiced. An equivalent in English would be practicing switching between s and z sounds. The difference between s and z in English is the exact same as the difference between sh and r in pinyin.\n\nFor example, the difference between the words sue and zoo is only that your vocal cords do not vibrate for the s in sue and they do for the z in zoo. But other than that, the consonants are pronounced the same, and the vowels are the same. So, you can imagine a drill for someone learning English but\nstruggling to make the z sound which would be to switch between an s sound and a z sound continuously.

I think that's definitely valid to think about, but I wouldn't let that stop you. I think the connectedness will emerge naturally if you let it. That's literally what your brain is best at: connecting things!\n\nCloze Overlapper looks interesting but if it were me, I wouldn't use it. The flexibility you get from using your own note types is too great. My biggest recommendation would be to invest in creating your own note types.\n\ne.g.:\n\n**Note Type**: Geological Time Scale\n\nFields:\n\n* Name: e.g. Archean, Paleozoic, Pliocene\n* Unit: e.g. Eon, Era, Period, Epoch\n* Previous: e.g. Paleozoic if the card is for Mesozoic\n* Next: e.g. Mesozoic if the card is for Paleozoic\n* Start: e.g. 225Ma\n* End: e.g. \\~335Ma\n* Parent: e.g. Neogene if the card is Pliocine\n\nThen, you create one card type for each of the fields in the note type:\n\n* Card Type 1 - What unit is the {Paleozoic}? ({Era})\n* Card Type 2 - What {Era} came before the {Paleozoic}? ({Precambrian})\n* Card Type 3 - What {Era} came after the {Paleozoic}? ({Mesozoic})\n* Card Type 4 - When did the {Paleozoic} {Era} begin? ({541.0 Ma})\n* Card Type 5 - When did the {Paleozoic} {Era} end? ({251.90 Ma})\n* Card Type 6 - What is the parent of the {Cretaceous} {Period}? ({Mesozoic})\n\nDoes that make sense? The stuff in curly braces {} indicates stuff populated from a field on your note. Then I put the card backs in parentheses ().\n\nYes, you'll end up with a TON of cards. 6 per note, at least. But the advantage is, you'll be able to fly through reviews, doing 1 per 1-3s probably. Either you know it, or you don't, because they're simple atoms. And the connectedness comes out of the different types of questions asked from different sides (e.g. the Previous and Next questions are the same info, but from different perspectives)\n\nThen, you can create a new note type for Events.\n\nFor example:\n\n**Note Type**: Events\n\nFields:\n\n* Name\n* Description\n* Start\n* End\n* Start Epoch (or Start Age, or however deep you want to go)\n* End Epoch\n\nYou may choose to change the fields. These are just suggestions I came up with quickly to serve as an example for what I would be likely to do.\n\n>I also wonder if the cards (where appropriate) could include the mnemonics in some sort of \"hint\" field, which activates after a certain amount of time passes?\n\nI actually think this would be a bad idea. The fact that you're thinking about \"after a certain amount of time passes\" indicates to me that you don't have the speed of review clear in your head. You shouldn't be spending minutes on a card. That means your card is too complicated, and it will be too difficult to judge whether you got it right or not.\n\nIf you want to memorize the mnemonics themselves (lol), you could make simple cards for them. But that seems questionably useful to me.\n\n>I am a visual learner for the most part.\n\nI wouldn't put too much stock by this. How would you propose to learn the sequence of periods visually? It doesn't really make sense to me. You can include images in your cards if you think of good images that correspond well.

That\u2019s not all they are, and other areas still have rote memorization components, but there\u2019s more in biology or Chinese than math, I\u2019d say.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t learn other subjects effectively with Anki, but I think it\u2019s simpler to do.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of principles that should guide your card development:\n\n1) Atomization. Never make a card about more than one thing. If you do, you get into tricky practical territory where you remember part of a card, but not the whole. This is a problem because it will make you less efficient in your reviewing. There may also be cognitive reasons not to do it, but I\u2019m only familiar with the practical side of things. As an example of this, learning Spanish I create at least 3 cards for each noun: Spanish -> English, English -> Spanish, and Noun -> Gender. Keeping the Noun -> Gender card separate means I never worry about how to score myself in the cases where I remember the word, but forget the gender.\n\n2) Never make cards for things you don\u2019t understand. Anki doesn\u2019t help you learn things, it helps you memorize. So if you are able to get to a point where you understand something, however small, Anki can make sure you don\u2019t forget it. This can be a massive boon to future learning, because you\u2019ll never forget the foundational pieces of your knowledge, but it\u2019s not learning itself.\n\nI think those two principles are a great starting point. They naturally imply that the most crucial part of the process is breaking a subject down into understandable atoms. For that, I don\u2019t know that I can be much help other than to say that you have to practice it and it\u2019s a skill that you\u2019ll get better at over time.\n\nTo bring it back to the beginning, I think another way to phrase the reason that languages and biology are easier to use Anki for is that the understandable atoms are more obvious.\n\nThese principles are not my own.

It doesn\u2019t really help you \u201clearn\u201d it very well. So usually, it\u2019s best to pair the cards you make with a learning experience involving the contents of the card. For example, for every vocab or grammar card you make, you should have at least example one sentence, and potentially several, that uses the word/construction in a context you understand.

There's some small amount of transfer, but on the whole it's foolhardy to think that you'll be able to speak without intensive speaking practice and be able to listen and understand without intensive listening practice. This may or may not sound obvious, but in my experience it's very true.\n\nNow, given that general principle, you can think about whether being good at speaking and listening are goals that you have. I would suspect that they are, based on what you've said so far, but that's a personal decision.\n\nIf they are, then here are some tips/guidelines:\n\n1. Tones are super important. You need to learn how to produce them and recognize them if you're eventually going to be able to speak Chinese at a high level. Practice them in isolation, and then practice stringing them together.\n2. Pronunciation is also quite important. Since the sounds in Chinese are likely to be very different than the sounds in your native language, it's probably a good idea to study the phonology of Chinese. I like this video series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HtCxSLUU6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HtCxSLUU6s) The first video might also be useful in its treatment of tones. This process involves understanding how to move your tongue the same way that Chinese speakers move their tongues when they speak Chinese. It's difficult and takes time, but is definitely possible!\n3. In the process of working on 1 + 2, recording yourself and listening critically is an important and useful technique. Compare yourself to recordings of native speakers and see what's different. Over time, you'll gain an appreciation for what is normal variation within the accent of a native speaker, and what is just plain wrong. This will help with both your own pronunciation and your ability to listen, because you'll just have a better sense for the sound of the language in general.\n4. Conversation practice is essential. italki is probably the best way to do this while you're at a beginner-ish level. But beware that many Chinese teachers on italki are unfamiliar with how to actually just run a conversational lesson. I have one teacher that I enjoyed taking conversational lessons from, and I can recommend her in a DM if you want. A lot of teachers, especially those living in China, will still have a Chinese model of language learning, and try to have it be very textbook-based, similar to what you were doing before. Trust your gut here. If you feel like you're having good conversations on new and varied topics with someone, and that they're able to support you doing that mostly in Chinese, then trust that. If you don't feel like that's the case, then look for a new teacher. The best teachers give you time to try to formulate your thoughts, and then help you out when you fail by providing the words or phrases that you need to fill in the gaps in what you said. They should also send you a list of all your stumbling points in the conversation over skype or some document software, so that you can create flashcards from and review the things you didn't know how to say. Conversations are super powerful flashcard fodder, because often you'll be able to harken back to the specific moment in the conversation where you wanted to say something and couldn't. Beware also of switching teachers frequently and as a result only practicing the same conversational material. Eventually some amount of continuity is good. \n5. You seem to already be aware of this, but finding some kind of podcast that works for your level is good listening practice. I worry less about vocab acquisition through podcasts and more just about immersing yourself in the culture and practicing understanding what people say. I often pause, take a guess at what someone just said, look it up in a dictionary, and then continue. This can be a frustrating process, so don't worry about finishing a whole episode in that fashion or anything. Just do it as you have energy for it. And re-listening to old episodes can be very productive to solidify things. There are a bunch of lists of good podcasts on this subreddit. Shadowing is a technique where you follow along with some dialog and try to mimic exactly how the speakers pronounce things. This is a productive exercise to do while listening to podcasts.\n\nAnyway, that's about it!

I don't have fully fleshed-out answer to them necessarily, but let me see if I can make some progress by writing up a response.\n\nCertainly, understanding Peter Attia's work and being better able to consume it is a goal of mine. So in that respect, I think that's an obvious angle of directness for me. Maybe a good ultralearning project would be to take a certain episode group of his and go top-down from there, diving into the things that I don't understand that come up in the episodes. His 5 episodes with Tom Dayspring come to mind, as I haven't touched them yet due to the level of technicality.\n\nI guess I must confess that I'm not necessarily even thinking of this in terms of a single ultralearning project at this point. I definitely imagine doing such projects in the future, but moreso than being interested in doing any specific project, I'm thinking in terms of learning about medicine in an ongoing way for the entire course of my life. I enjoy thinking about the body as a system, and trying to understand the ways it works, as well as the limitations of our ability to understand the way it works, and thinking about optimal medical decision-making in light of the constraints we face. Because of this, I feel that at some point I will certainly have to take a bottom-up approach, given that I took exactly 0 biology or biochemistry or anatomy courses in school. There are some basic building blocks that I'm missing.\n\nSo, my initial thought was to perhaps do an ultralearning project that essentially covers some of the base-level courses that would be required to get into med school or taught in its first year. But, I still have a relatively poor understanding of what that consists of. In the spirit of meta-learning, I suppose I should commit some substantial time to try to map out the space myself. That would probably be a very beneficial exercise in and of itself, in any case. And your suggestions of poking my head in the med school anki subreddit is a good one, and looking for curricula. I also have some friends who are in or have gone through med school, so I suppose I could reach out to them.\n\nI'm definitely interested in reading the book. I really enjoyed the episode with Jason Fung, and in some ways it's probably the episode that started me down this path. Their discussion about theoretical vs experimental physics and how there's nothing similar in medicine (perhaps for good reason), was intriguing to me and made me realize that I do really enjoy thinking about the body as a system. Although it strikes me that indulging that too much and trying to educate myself in medicine without actually becoming a doctor could potentially be hazardous to my own health, ha! But that hasn't dissuaded me, yet :)\n\nPeter Attia's articles may also be a good starting point. I think it would behoove me to do some more thinking about what my overall goals are and the scope of what I'd like to learn overall vs for an initial project.\n\nFor reference, my primary experience with autodidactism is in language learning. There, I don't really take a goal-based or directness-based approach. I do it because I love the process and am just fundamentally interested in all aspects of language. It's unclear to me whether this same process will apply to learning medical things, or whether something more goal-based would be better here.\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for starting this subreddit! I'm definitely interested in finding a larger community of autodidacts, because I've been seriously toying with the idea of taking longer breaks from work to do various learning projects, but it would be amazing to have a support system and some friendship in the process.\n\nI'll post more when I know more :)", "created_utc": "1571634092.0", "edited": "False", "id": "f4k3jul", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_dkpxc9", "parent_id": "t1_f4jzw1s", "score": "1", "subreddit": "UltraLearningFans", "subreddit_id": "t5_25qmty"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "I wrote up a whole reply disagreeing with you, but in the end I actually think I mostly agree with you, even though I would express it differently.

But I would suspect that most people don't even come close to that anyway when living in a foreign country.\n\nFor me, personally, I definitely think that going back to China or Taiwan would yield massive improvements for my Mandarin, but that's because a) I know I'd put in the effort while there, and b) I've already put in massive amounts of efforts at home.

Or is the stable one enough? I have no evidence whatsoever to back this up, but in my mind I view Sparks as the volatile one and Pickard as the stable one.

That could either be because over the long run, matchup games are mostly a wash and people don\u2019t spend meaningfully more time against \u201ctougher\u201d competition than \u201cweaker\u201d competition, or because the ways we have of measuring these effects so far are not accurately portraying reality.

There are vocab lists that accompany each level. Ultimately you can decide what you think will be useful to learn, but if you come across a new word and you\u2019re unsure whether it\u2019s a good word to learn right now, you can check to see if it\u2019s listed on one of the HSK lists that\u2019s close to your level.

Basically the idea is that each time you get a flashcard right, the system will wait a longer time before testing you on it again, and so it is a more efficient way to commit vocab to long-term memory. (http://ankisrs.net)\n\n\nWhat I do is break down words into multiple flashcards, where each type of flashcard has a goal, like \u201cHow do you write the missing character?\u201d or \u201cWhat word goes in the blank in this sentence?\u201d  or \u201cWhat is the word associated with this picture/definition?\u201d etc. That way you can acknowledge that you know the word, but don\u2019t know how to write it yet, and vice versa.\n", "created_utc": "1530630291.0", "edited": "False", "id": "e1pyjay", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_8v0phq", "parent_id": "t1_e1prwch", "score": "2", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qyz1"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "I haven\u2019t seen anybody else say this, but try to set aside some time for personal study. You have 20 hours of class a week, which is a lot, but you probably could add some extra study time to tailor things more precisely to your needs. I would recommend creating and reviewing flashcards as a good way to use this time. In your classes and while you\u2019re talking to people, you will encounter lots of words you don\u2019t know. Make a list of some of these words, and try to determine which ones will be most useful. I\u2019m currently cross-referencing against HSK vocabulary lists to determine which words I think are useful and which aren\u2019t. Then you can create flashcards with those words that you think are most useful, and review them. In case you aren\u2019t familiar with it, most people recommend Anki for this. I would recommend creating at least two or three types of flashcards: One is called Cloze deletion, where you find a sentence with the word you want to learn, and replace the word with a blank. This can also be used to learn grammar items. Then you can put the word itself on the back, and your goal is to complete the sentence by finding the correct word. Another type is you can put the word on the front, and you have to remember the pronunciation and the definition, and perhaps your example sentence for the word. A third type could be that you put an image (or maybe a definition?) on the front, and you have to recall the word. You can experiment what works for you. The purpose of flashcards is to reinforce the words that you\u2019ve come across. Since you\u2019ll be getting lots of input from your classes, being on the streets, and language exchanges, I think setting aside some extra time to make and review flashcards could be very beneficial. If you search online, there are lots of people with their own ideas about flashcards, and you can draw inspiration from them, for example Olly Richards and Gabe Wyner. Good luck!

With a belt, they sit about an inch higher than without, but even without they're not in danger of falling off.

It is a difficult task, but people often make it out to be more of an art than it really is. I mean, it definitely is a bit of an art, but people don't realize how well you can break pronunciation/accent down in the manageable, practiceable chunks.\n\nOff the top of my head, I would identify pronunciation, rhythm and tones as the main aspects of a Chinese accent.\n\nRhythm is probably the most \"art-like\" of those, at least insofar as its the one I think about least on a day-to-day basis, but I would assume this can be broken down into figuring out where and when people shorten or lengthen their words to convey certain emotions or meanings. And pauses. I also think you can probably worry about that after you master the others.\n\nMore important are pronunciation and tones. There's good news! You can definitely learn how to pronounce Chinese. There are three keys to learning pronunciation and tones in Chinese (or any language for that matter).\n\nThe first is to understand the physical mechanics of how you are supposed to produce sounds in Chinese. It's kind of revelationary once you understand that human pronunciation just consists of forming your mouth into the right shape and then creating vibrations by adding airflow. Just start making a noise and then move your lips, jaw, and tongue around. The sounds you're making change! How cool is that? You can go online and find videos or written explanations that describe what shape or position your mouth needs to be in to make sounds the way Chinese people make sounds. To make an analogy, pretend you're learning to kick a soccer ball. Your coach will probably start by explaining the mechanics of a good kick: Your foot plants beside the ball, and then you swing your legs through, and make contact with a certain part of your foot, and then you follow-through etc. Now you understand in a very general sense the mechanics of what you are trying to accomplish.\n\nOnce you know how Chinese people's mouths move, and how your mouth is supposed to move, you can move on to the next step: trying to produce those sounds yourself! Think about your mouth's shape and the position of your tongue. Pick a sound, recall what you read about how this sound is supposed to be pronounced, and then try to make that happen in your mouth. Put your tongue in the right place, exhale or vibrate your vocal cords, and see what sound comes out! Think about the differences between where your tongue and mouth are positioned for certain Mandarin sounds as opposed to other similar English sounds. Sometimes it might sound pretty good, and sometimes it might not. There are good days and bad days. To continue the analogy, now that your coach has explained how you should properly kick a soccer ball, it's your job to practice implementing it. Go kick a ball, and try to implement the technique your coach told you about.\n\nThe third step is to critique and analyze yourself. You can do this while you're practicing, but maybe it's helpful to think of it as a separate step. Once you've practiced for a little while, you're probably getting the hang of some things, and perhaps still struggling with others. What you should do is revisit the theory, and assess your progress so far. Notice how much better you can feel the areas and movements of your mouth, now that you've practiced and thought about these things so much. Review the mechanics of the sounds, and with your newfound awareness of how your mouth works, see what you notice about how you are pronouncing things. Maybe you have a tendency to put your tongue in a slightly wrong spot when you make a certain sound, or perhaps certain combinations of sounds are tricky for you. Make note of these and practice them. Maybe you will record yourself, to compare against audio of natives speaking. This is a reflective process where you try to reconcile the theory you learned with your current amount of progress. The final part of the analogy: You've practiced kicking the ball a whole bunch. Now you show your coach, and he or she identifies what has improved, and what still needs work. Maybe certain parts of the motion look good, but you're still making contact with the ball with the wrong part of your foot. Maybe your consistency is lacking. And so on and so forth. Your coach will suggest things to work on, and you will hopefully now understand your coach's goals better, now that you have spent time practicing the movement. Except, unlike this example, you are your own coach, unless you find someone to teach you.\n\nTones are conceptually simpler, and therefore paradoxically harder to explain over text. You can use a similar process of understanding how things are supposed to be, practicing, and then evaluating in order to work on them. Tones are like singing. When your vocal cords vibrate, they produce certain pitches. In English, we are somewhat careless with these pitches, because they don't convey meaning. At most they convey tone. But in Mandarin, as I'm sure you've been told, they are important semantic tools, as they help distinguish between several otherwise-identically-pronounced characters. So just figure out what it feels like to produce each of the four tones. I often find it helpful to remove the pronunciation component of words or sentences to focus on the tone. If you listen to a Chinese person say something, you can try to mimic only their pitches, using the word \"ah\" or \"mm\" or something. Kind of like you're trying to sing the same melody they just sung without worrying about the lyrics to the song.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was a helpful explanation! The TLDR of my post is simply: become aware of how your mouth and vocal cords produce sounds, and then use that knowledge to make your production of Mandarin sounds the same as native speakers.\n\nFeel free to PM me with questions.

His appraising eyes were small slits underneath full, black eyebrows, which were in striking contrast to his deep crimson skin. He stayed there, head cocked, peering at me for what felt like an hour. Then he reached up with one hand and scratched the horn protruding from the right side of neatly coiffed, jet-black hair, shook his head, and smiled at me. I felt some of the muscles in my back relax ever so slightly.\n\n\"So let me get this straight. Your fianc\u00e9e of two years, Jenna, was struck and killed by a transport truck last week, and immediately accepted into Heaven by God. Now, your other lover, Rachel, fell seriously ill two weeks ago, and the doctor has told you that she only has days to live. Your plan for when you die, is to get back together with Jenna in heaven and live happily ever after. But you're worried about what's going to happen if Rachel also gets into heaven, and the two of them meet, since as far as you can tell, they've both led impeccable lives. And so you're here offering your soul in exchange for me to persuade God to keep Rachel out of heaven. Is that correct?\"\n\nI looked at the devil sheepishly: \"Yep, that's more or less the measure of it.\"\n\nHe chuckled again. \"That is some terrible luck. But also poor planning on your part, I must say.\"\n\n\"Don't I know it.\"\n\n\"What makes you so sure you'll get into heaven anyway? You don't strike me as exactly the type God wants to let in to his kingdom.\"\n\n\"Well, of course I'm prepared to beg and ask for forgiveness. But if we can make a deal here, I reckon it doesn't much matter, really. Sure, I'd rather be with Jenna eternally, but if I get sent to hell, I'll make do with Rachel. I love both of them, you know. But the important part is that those two do NOT meet in any kind of afterlife.\"\n\n\"I see.\" The devil reached his arm to scratch the other horn, thinking. \"Well, I've got to be honest with you. Over the years, I've accumulated numerous souls, I don't have very much need any more. But, I'll think about it. Come back tomorrow. Bring any compromising notes, pictures or videos of Rachel that I might be able to use in discussion with God, and I'll take a look.\"\n\nAt this point, that felt like the best I could hope for. I gathered my things, and prepared to head for the exit of the Purgatory building we were meeting in. \"Thank you, Mr. Devil.\"\n\n\"Please, call me Stan.\"\n\n----\n\nThat first encounter was 3 weeks ago. Rachel passed away shortly after my second encounter with Stan the day after. He had promised he would do his best to convince God to send her to hell. Our deal was soul-transfer-upon-eternal-damnation, but apparently Rachel was being held temporarily in the depths of the Purgatory building, while God and Stan discussed. So, I was still in firm possession of my soul, and an big old bag of anxiety about the whole situation. I had visited Stan every day since, hoping I could help him in some way.\n\nBut my interactions with Stan were getting a little bit strange. Let me explain. The third time I went to meet with him, he was late. He made me wait for hours. I hadn't eaten at all that day, and fortunately there was a kitchen adjacent to the room I was waiting for Stan in. I asked one of his aides if I could use the ingredients in the fridge to cook myself something, and he said it was no problem. I fancy myself a pretty good cook, and indeed, I was able to pull together a pretty tasty chicken soup before Stan arrived. When Stan arrived, I offered him a bowl, even though I was pretty pissed. He ate, and told me it was the best thing he'd ever tasted. I thought he was just being polite, but now I slowly became less sure. He invited me back to cook for him, again and again. I didn't feel like I can refuse his offer... He's the Devil after all, and we were in the middle of a deal. \n\nBut, I felt quite weird about the whole situation. Stan seemed less interested in resolving my situation, in completing our deal than he did in my cooking. Each time I came back to his office he had purchased new ingredients for a new dish. He always told me, \"Make extra.\" Eggplant parmesan, fish tacos, homestyle chili, I cooked for him every day.\n\nOne day, I was working in the kitchen, trying to keep my mind off of the ever-looming prospect of Jenna and Rachel meeting in heaven, hoping God would make up his mind soon. The dish for the day was spaghetti and meatballs with a salad and bread on the side. I chopped garlic, onions, peppers and mushrooms, sauteing them before adding the tomato sauce. I opened the spice drawer, looking for the usual assortment of Italian herbs. It was empty. I turned down the element on the stove, and hurried out of the kitchen, looking for someone who I could send to help me buy the spices I needed. The reception desk was empty, and so I walked past down a long hallway. Nobody was around. I knocked on several doors, looking for an aide. I wondered where Stan was.\n\nI turned right and headed down another hallway. At the end, I saw a door slightly ajar, soft light spilling out into the dimly lit hallway. I approached and knocked briefly before opening the door. The room's dark red walls were lavishly decorated, colourful paintings in ornate frames arrayed on all sides. In the center of the room was a table. Two freshly lit candles were placed in the middle of the table, on top of a thick pentagram tablecloth. Two chairs rested on either side of the table, plates and cutlery neatly set at each place. Stan sat in one of the chairs, facing the door. Relieved to have found him, I let him know about the spice situation.\n\n\"Hey, Stan. Sorry to interrupt, but the kitchen seems--\"\n\nStan leapt out of his chair and practically sprinted towards me, lines of surprise and worry suddenly appearing on his face. As he reached the door, he placed his hand square on my chest and pushed hard, forcing me backwards out of the room. As he did this, he looked backwards over his shoulder at the other chair in the room. My gaze followed his.\n\n\"Heeeyy, sorry about that, I've got company. You say there's a problem in the kitchen?\", he said with a feeble attempt at a friendly chuckle.\n\nBut I had already seen what Stan didn't want me to see. Sitting in the chair across from him was a woman. I had seen the familiar long, brown hair sweep to one side as Stan's date turned around to see who was at the door. As Stan pushed me out, I had glimpsed her silhouette, confirming what I had known immediately: It was Rachel.\n\nStan shut the door behind us, as my face grew hot. I couldn't hold myself back. I pushed him back against the door.\n\n\"What the hell is this, Stan? That's Rachel!\"\n\n\"I can explain. We're just--\"\n\nMy voice rose as my brain pieced things together for itself. \"What is there to explain?! You have no intention of helping me any more. You're playing with me. You're dating my dead ex-lover, making me cook for you, and passing it off as your own!\"\n\nStan's body tensed, preparing to throw me off. He opened his mouth to defend himself. Then, he relaxed. He dropped his hands and looked at me.\n\nThis time it was his turn to speak sheepishly. He said, \"Yep, that's more or less the measure of it.\"\n", "created_utc": "1504820017.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dmpb767", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_6ymdfn", "parent_id": "t3_6ymdfn", "score": "7", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "Je suis pas fran\u00e7ais, alors excusez mes erreurs, mais je vais tenter \u00e0 t'expliquer la diff\u00e9rence entre Char\\* et Char[].

I think it was a good choice.\n\nFor me, what that entailed was just taking a boat-load of elective language courses. I'm not sure what your situation allows, but throughout my degree I ended up taking: 2 French courses (had a background in French, now maybe my worst language), 3 German courses (took German in high school), and 4 Chinese courses (no prior background in Chinese).

I'm still fairly beginner at it, so some of my adviice will come from my insights gleaned from my Chinese learning process. And all my advice is language-agnostic, not German specific. The number 1 most important thing is making sure what you are learning from and consuming is at the appropriate level. If it is too hard, you'll not understand anything, get discouraged, and stop working. If it's too easy, you won't make progress. It is _very_ important to make sure that the resources you use are at an appropriate level. Things should be challenging, but manageable.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, I can say the second most important thing: stop worrying about the details of \"how to study\" before you really get started. As long as you're consuming material that is at an appropriate level, the material itself isn't all that important, because unless it is flat out incorrect, you will learn something from it. More important is what will keep you engaged.\n\nThird most important thing is vary your material. Don't use exclusively one resource. If you find a great video series, by all means, use it to its max, but you should also supplement with reading and writing activities.\n\nSo, on to more specific recommendations, bearing those 3 most important things in mind. Remember, if you actively consume lots of appropriate-level material for a long period of time, you will improve.\n\nNow, it seems daunting at the beginning because you don't know what it is that you don't know, and there is very little that you can comprehend in your target language at the beginning. Thus, I recommend signing up for a language class if possible. I have always started my own language learning journeys in a classroom, and then once more comfortable, I have been able to branch out into self-directed learning.\n\nIf enrolling for classes is not an option, then I recommend getting a textbook, either designed for use in a classroom or for self-study. Use this textbook as your main guide for progression in the language until you reach the end or you feel confident enough to transition away from it. You might go through several textbooks like this.\n\nTo supplement your textbook learning, you need to do other things. One exercise that I like to do is find a podcast or video that is at a quite challeging level for me. At the beginning, this could be as simple as someone saying \"Der Mann ist gro\u00df\" and other simple sentences. Then, I listen to the video, and with or without the help of subtitles, I write down every single word in the video, looking up each and every one that I don't know. It can sometimes feel tedious, but I actually usually enjoy it. Then, after you have transcribed yhe whole video, you can go back and create a list of all the words in the video that were new to you, and you can review them by watching the video again and analyzing the meaning of the contexts in which the worss were used. You could check out Glossika, or simply use youtube videos.\n\nThen you can also supplement by using chat websites/reddit/lang8 to practice your production. Honestly, I don't do very much of this type of practice, but it can be useful for some.\n\nMy summary is this: if you're just starting out, buy a textbook and/or enrol in a class. These will introduce you to basic grammar and vocab in a reasonable order. This lays the foundation for self-study through reading graded readers (forgot to mention these) or online articles, listening intently to videos and transcribing, chatting with other speakers of the language online etc.\n\nI hope this is at least somewhat helpful for you! Sorry it's not more specific, I really feel it doesn't need to be. Go google \"German textbook\" see what pops up, look for something with good reviews at an appropriate level, purchase, and work your way through the book, one chapter at a time. Then supplement.

Many people were worried that the moon itself was an instrument of constant surveillance, and that the moon was merely the first step towards the dystopian future that Orwell described.\n\nThis widespread fear prompted lots of research to be done on the topic at that time. The results are important and informative, and it's honestly quite surprising that we haven't made a bigger effort to make sure they stay in the public eye. In any case, the scientists found that the moon is not just one celestial entity, but a whole family. There are uncountably many moon brothers and sisters who each live in one slice of the night sky. So as you move from one place to another, you may instead be seeing the moon's brother Angelo or sister Katrina instead of the moon himself. If you pay very close attention, you can see when one fades out of view and the other in, but humans in general are not very observant and only a few people have ever actually witnessed this.\n\nIn any case, rest assured that the moon is not following you.", "created_utc": "1446295910.0", "edited": "False", "id": "cwje2ut", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3qx1fz", "parent_id": "t3_3qx1fz", "score": "1", "subreddit": "shittyaskscience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw51"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "What?

If more people carrying concealed is proven to minimize the quantity of deaths that we deem to be important, whether its mass shootings or otherwise, then I am for more people to carry concealed. However, I somehow doubt that is the case. Nevertheless, I obviously cannot pronounce on the matter without knowing. All I'm asking is whether you would be willing to cede some degree of this freedom you hold dear, if it was empirically shown to cause X number of deaths per year. Does that not sound reasonable? It doesn't matter the underlying causes really, as the current problem is, we have an exorbitant number of people dying from guns. If there is a possible solution that involves fewer innocent deaths, we must take it. It has always been the case that freedom is paramount, but only when freedoms do not cause harm to others. That's why hate speech and inciting violence is a crime. Likewise, if the absence of gun control laws is shown to cause innocent deaths, I believe the freedom to own a gun without abiding by gun control laws should be removed. If that does not sound reasonable to you, I would sincerely like to know why.\n\nRe: your point on mandatory background checks, that is very interesting, maybe it should be unsurprising given that it seems to be an unfortunate pattern. However, if we are in the business of saving lives here, I'm afraid those are two separate problems.

However, none of the things you say really make it any more fun. It still feels brutal to have to build it, and it is undoubtedly strong once completed. Rather than justifying whether or not it is balanced, I think Meteos wants a look at the question \"Would the removal of this item make League of Legends more fun?\" and I believe it would. Pretty much everyone in the game has an easy way to pick up at least some MR, and the other team can't build it, so you won't get into aura-arms-race type scenarios. Maybe small tweaks on some build-paths/items would have to happen to compensate, but I don't think its outright removal would be too drastic.", "created_utc": "1436739117.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ct12lt4", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_3d0zyb", "parent_id": "t1_ct0vts7", "score": "1", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx"}, {"author": "IAmTheKingOfSpain", "body": "Man TSM is so bad.
