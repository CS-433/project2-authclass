The first is to accept it. Ideally, you *should* be hungry at mealtime. If you're hungry between meals, then you need to adjust what, when or how much you eat. \n\nYou can only lose weight in a health manner, if you lose it at a rate that's proportional to your fat stores. A person with 100 lbs or more to lose, may be able to lose 2 or more pounds per week. A person with 10 lbs to lose may only be able to lose 1/2 lbs per week. It's not a race. The goal is to learn how to eat a healthy amount of a healthy diet. You may need to adjust your calorie and weight loss goals to manage hunger effectively. \n\nFood selection affects hunger. Most people find that protein and fibrous complex carbohydrates are more filling than fatty, sugary food. Volume also helps. Experiment with what you eat and pay attention to how well it controls your appetite. \n\nWhen you eat is also important. I'm hungry in the morning. I skipped breakfast for years, but that left me vulnerable to snacking. I've found that I do best with a large breakfast with a lot of protein and fiber, a large lunch and a tiny dinner. However, some people find that they do best when they skip breakfast or eat it mid-morning. Some people even prefer eating only once per day. There's no \"correct\" meal timing, so eat when it's best for you. \n\nPCOS is a symptom of insulin resistance. IR is genetic and gets worse with weight gain. How much weight you need to carry to be symptomatic varies from person to person. Symptoms vary too. Weight loss is hard for everybody, but not because of IR, rather because it involves changing habits and dealing with complex food and weight related emotions. It requires a lot of patience. Good studies have shown that women with PCOS have perfectly normal metabolic rates and that degree of IR does not affect rate of weight loss. Telling people falsely that \"it will be extra hard for you\" is not helpful. \n\nThere's no \"right way\" to lose weight. Instead you have to find what works best for you. That may be a certain diet or eating pattern, but it also may include various aids including apps, support groups, medicines, therapy or even surgery. None of those choices are \"wrong\".

In order to use up the energy that you have stored in your fat, you have to use more energy than you eat. There is no other way. Some medicines, like olanzapine, can change the way your body uses up its energy, but only while you're taking the medicine. Right now, you're eating as much energy as you're using which is why your weight is stable. \n\nStop eyeballing your portions, even dietitians are unable to estimate portions.

I actually gained weight on it. I had success later by reducing the portion sizes of my regular Mediterraneanish diet. I still enjoy a bit of sugar sweetened dark chocolate or ice cream now and then. I eat a lot of fruit and a moderate amount of other carbohydrates. My A1C, like yours, is now in the very normal range, the last one was 5.1 despite sugar consumption.\n\nThe problem with restrictive diets is that while some people find that labeling a food \"poison\" helps them avoid it, other people find that \"off limits\" foods become more attractive. In general though, long term dietary compliance is worse with more restrictive diets. That doesn't mean that some people don't do well with keto, vegan, or other highly restrictive diets, because of course there are many people who do benefit from them.

The very muscular Serena Williams has often been said to be \"obese by BMI\", but before her pregnancy, her BMI was really at the upper end of \"normal\" and nowhere near \"obese\". \n\nOTOH, some people who have been overweight for most of their life may not be able to comfortably maintain an ideal weight, so they should do the best that they can, even if the best weight they can maintain is outside of the \"normal\" range. \n\nThere is also some confusion about various populations. Some Asian countries have established lower \"normal BMI\" standards because of the increased diabetes risk that is found in their populations at the higher end of the \"normal\" range. Other people sometimes say that BMI is \"racist\" because some populations have an average BMI that is higher than white people in industrialized countries. However, those heavier populations also have higher rates of diabetes and still demonstrate similar diabetes risk *by BMI*. \n\nMy personal experience was that at a BMI of 25, I had pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension despite \"normal\" weight (I'm 5'7\"/170 cm). At a BMI between 21 and 22, I have excellent blood sugar and blood pressure.", "created_utc": "1661816031.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imbjag6", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x0jvvc", "parent_id": "t1_imb5gef", "score": "2", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "SDJellyBean", "body": "Actually, it's not clear that that's true. \n\nhttps://breakingmuscle.com/footballs-big-men-fit-or-fat/", "created_utc": "1661814427.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imbfuot", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x0jvvc", "parent_id": "t1_imb5z3y", "score": "2", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "SDJellyBean", "body": "Either way is perfectly fine, just use the correct tracker entry for raw/dry or cooked rice.

Processing is a continuum. Pre-cooked foods can be loaded with fats, sugars and salt, but commercial marinara sauce, for example, is pretty much the same as something you would make yourself. Conversely, milk goes through a lot of processing to become cheese which, in moderation, is quite nutritious. Just because someone else cooked it, doesn't mean it's unhealthy. \n\n\"Loaded with fat, sugars and salt\" is the biggest part of the problem. If you also rein in white flour and weird things like hydrolyzed starch/protein and partially-hydrogenated oils you'll have eliminated a lot of the \"processed food\" problem. OTOH, some of the \"chemical\" names like \"ascorbic acid\" that appear in ingredients lists are really just vitamins. \n\n\"Shop the outer edge of the grocery store\" is a common piece of advice that's pretty good. Lots of vegetables and fruits, \u2014 mix them up, \u2014 potatoes, corn and peas can definitely be part of the mix. Lean meats and fish are great protein sources, but watch the fats. Unsweetened dairy products are good, but you don't *have* to drink milk. You can visit the middle of the store for canned vegetables, beans (providing both carbohydrates and protein!) and grains. The freezer aisle has plenty of good choices; vegetables, fruit and pre-made meals (look at the fat and salt contents). Frozen fish and chicken are fine if you choose raw and grilled versions. Stuff with breading and sauce is usually going to be high in fat and salt. Nuts, nut butters, seeds and cheese are good sources of protein, but also contain a lot of fat and can be a big calorie hit. Bread can be pretty calorie-dense too, so be careful with it.\n\nThere's a lot of bad nutrition advice out there, so you do have to be a bit careful about what you read.

For dessert I had a frozen banana. \n\nOther simple meals that I make include omelets or scrambled eggs with vegetables, \"fried rice\" made with a little leftover rice and lots of riced cauliflower as well as an egg and the usual flavorings, roasted or pan-saut\u00e9ed chicken or fish and vegetables, salads with beans, baked sweet or white potato topped with salsa, leftover chicken, vegetables. \n\nIn between meals, I carry a travel mug of hot or iced herb tea to sip whenever I think about a snack. \n\nI also found that I do best with a large breakfast, largish lunch and lighter dinner. By \"large\" I mean both in volume and calories. If I'm still hungry after dog walking, I have a piece of fruit and some nonfat Greek yogurt. Some people can skip breakfast and do well, but I can't.

I also like lightly steamed carrots dressed with lemon juice, EVOO and harissa. Carrots are good roasted as well. \n\nFrozen peas and lima beans are generally better than fresh (unless you're picking them yourself!) and Trader Joe's frozen haricots verts are better than any fresh green bean that isn't homegrown. Don't overcook them and they won't be mushy. I cook them in a covered dish with a splash of water for about 2 minutes in the microwave. In season fresh corn is better than frozen and takes [minutes to cook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/interactive/2022/how-to-shuck-corn-microwave/), but frozen is not too bad the rest of the year and only needs to be heated up. \n\nHeat a little olive oil in a big pan, stir some finely chopped garlic into the oil, dump in a bag of pre-washed spinach (the *whole* bag, don't skimp), stir it for about one minute until it's all well wilted and put it on a plate. That can't possibly be \"too long to prepare\". Pre-washed chopped greens will take a few more minutes to soften up. Cabbage has a more delicate flavor (I prefer the crinkly \"Savoy\" type), so it gets braised in butter with some shallot or onion rather than garlic.\n\nCabbage and Brussels sprouts will keep for weeks in the refrigerator and can be sauteed, roasted, cooked in soup, eaten raw, marinated, etc.\n\nI never steam vegetables. Julia Child frowned on the practice. Dropping them into salted, boiling water and cooking them *briefly* produces a better texture. \n\nWhen I see cheap mushrooms, I buy them, chop them into pea sized chunks and cook them down until they're dark brown. I freeze the result and put it into meatloaf or anything with ground beef. I put a lot of other vegetables in meatloaf, casseroles, lasagna, etc.\n\nJust about any vegetable can be roasted, including frozen ones. Whack them up into bite-sized pieces, toss them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper, spread them on a sheet pan and roast them in a hottish oven, flipping them around every ten minutes or so, do something else in the meantime. I prefer to add other spices at the end of the cooking time, rather than at the beginning; garam masala, smoked paprika, chopped garlic, za'atar, etc.\n\nI hate to see people dissing vegetables. So many pretty colors, so many different flavors and textures, and an infinite number of ways to cook them.", "created_utc": "1657422514.0", "edited": "1657422794.0", "id": "ifjx2i9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vuxlbl", "parent_id": "t1_ifjd5o3", "score": "4", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "SDJellyBean", "body": "I'd find a tracker entry for hash browns from a chain restaurant and use that.", "created_utc": "1657420287.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ifjssmf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_vuxlbl", "parent_id": "t1_ifjn45r", "score": "2", "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"author": "SDJellyBean", "body": "Walmart will sell you 90 tablets for $10 with no insurance.
