Some questions like \u201cAsians eat horses/dogs\u201d \u201cFrench eat frogs\u201d etc are really made up with someone\u2019s malicious intention of despising/discriminating/spreading propaganda about an ethnicity. Don\u2019t get me wrong, in some regions/cases it can be (partially) true (\u201cstereotype\u201d is not entirely wrong you know), but there\u2019s indeed a strong need to protect themselves, foreigners/foreign descendants from some malicious local people\u2019s intention speaking of both mental and physical health. How would you feel if you get asked that kind of question numerous times by a fair amount of people?\n\nThat\u2019s why I (and some other people) feel like there should be a limit to ignorance. \u201cYou guys eat XYZ, right?\u201d does not sound really well, man. At least to me. It\u2019s already slightly confirming, and this question can\u2019t be free from being regarded as judgmental. Yeah for sure, I myself wouldn\u2019t get so aggressive towards the person who asked me, but I\u2019d be \u201cready\u201d and stay alert. It really depends on the situation and questions, I repeat, though.\n\nI\u2019d be saying like \u201cI\u2019ve heard some people on [insert place] said you guys eat whales [in what way, how much, etc] \u2018is it true?\u2019\u201d especially considering I can even use the Internet, Books, etc.\n\nIgnorance itself isn\u2019t bad at all, but I\u2019m seeing examples where some malicious people ruin the kind and curious conversation you have raised above. And some people are in need of being judgmental to defend themselves from it. Like, \u201cthe person and the person\u2019s ignorance itself are not necessarily bad, but this guy is kind of person who makes no efforts doubting/checking given surrounding info (when the question itself is kinda getting malicious intention).\u201d\n\nEdit: some people in japan eat horses, too.

I\u2019m pretty sure discrimination happens even in Tokyo a lot, yet I think it\u2019s better.  Would you mind me asking where you are living? \n  \n2. I see that you speak fluent English. I wonder if you can have another job where you don\u2019t have to deal with the Japanese customers. e.g, supporting foreign exchange students, so-called gaishikei, language school if you can continue brushing up your English.  \n    \nI do know that what I\u2019m saying here is basically \u201cuse your foreign characteristics\u201d which is quite rude and even sounds racist if taken literally. You\u2019re Japanese even looking white, yes you should be able to act, behave, and decide what you do just like other Japanese people. I do know it. I painfully know that this isn\u2019t really fundamental solutions against racism.   \n  \nHowever, as you implied, you do not really have to fight against racism. The life is too short to even feel that sadness (except when you\u2019re actively seeking to fight against social issues).   \n  \nI said \u201cuse your foreign characteristics\u201d \u201cthis even sounds racist if taken seriously\u201d, but I hope you would understand that I\u2019m saying this because, because I do not want you to feel sad, get discriminated by us Japanese, nor die. I say this as an actual means to achieve my hope for you. Being Japanese << Less discrimination. Yes I have no right to say \u201cbeing Japanese<<...\u201d because it is the individual\u2019s identity; however at the same time It\u2019s not really wrong to take an action in order to avoid feeling sad and protect yourself from mental and physical dangers and it mustn\u2019t be judged by anyone. You can and should do that. I don\u2019t really have to mean and you don\u2019t really have to feel that you\u2019re purposefully using your foreign apparence, or dismissing Japanese identity. You can purely see it as a mere action to prevent possible dangers, which everyone normally does, as the most quickest, certain, effective and viable medium. I\u2019m extremely ultimately sure and aware of how we Japanese can\u2019t really change ourselves. \n  \nI do support that you escape from Japan. I believe you should keep improving your English skills to do that.   \n  \nI am a native Japanese university student in Tokyo. I do have many foreign friends, so-called \u201chaafu\u201d Japanese friends, do study intercultural communication, conduct case studies, and always try to hear struggles of them.  \n  \nI strongly hope that I could convey my opinions well.

In other wise, I can intelligently guess and grasp it.   \n  \nWell it\u2019s not really meaningless, rather useful. Although I only know basic 50+ grammars and tons of the same/almost same vocabularies, these are enough to allow me to travel around China alone with papers, notebooks and pens (so-called \u7b14\u8c08, \u7b46\u8ac7, passing on notes). Note that I must be aware of differences in the usages of some vocabs. If you can read Chinese, let\u2019s look at this: https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AD%86%E8%AB%87 this explains how Classical Chinese acted an important role in connecting Chinese-character realms in the past. \n  \nI have taken several online HSK sample tests and all of them said I can pass HSK 4 reading section, and some of them said I can pass HSK 5 grade section.

However I do find some English language learners who are struggling with word order. I don\u2019t think teachers teach how \u201cVerb\u201d is important especially in the English language.

Some languages do separate V, or have cases and change word orders freely, etc. \n  \n(I believe in any languages V is the core of conversation, and guess in SVO language V has stronger power than SOV language one. Good example might be how movie titles are translated\u2014 you can say \u201cFrozen\u201d in English, \u201cFrost\u201d in Norwegian etc... but our title is \u201cAnna and the queen of snow\u201d, \u201cTangled\u201d became \u201cRapunzel on the tower\u201d, it\u2019s always nouns.

I live in Tokyo too.\n\n\n1: we do sit in every other seats as possible as we can, when we can (I mean when it\u2019s not crowded.) \n\nLike, suppose that I sit in the second seat from edge. Both sides of seats from mine are occupied. Then, person who sit in the edge seat stand up and leave the train. Now, I\u2019ll 100% move to the edge seat. Why? It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t like another person who sit next to me. It\u2019s because of the sense of \u201cpersonal space\u201d of mind. I find that lots of people do this too. \n\nAt this point, I would like ask you that, when you \u201cobserve\u201d people\u2019s behavior, is the train crowded/really crowded? or not at all? Is it place where there aren\u2019t so many other tourists, or really big town? how many people are sitting and how they sit in the seats? \nNote that if it\u2019s not crowded and then you sit to next to something then any people would likely to be avoided. \n\nI\u2019d like to say that, the \u201cpersonal space\u201d of Japanese people are really huge. \n\nJust one of my perspective.\n\n2: yeah I hear these kinds of opinions: whether the foreign person is really tall/getting tattoo/big body(no offense)/kinda scary face, etc.....\nI can\u2019t really state. However, the most troublesome stuff is that we could do this totally unintentionally, like it could even be kinds of \u201cpsychological\u201d reactions. (The point that this isn\u2019t only connected to so-called being \u201cgaijin\u201d or like \u201cxenophobia (if any, really passive and unconsciously, etc) but also connected to some Japanese people who look like what I said) \nYeah in this point, I wouldn\u2019t be able to accuse them of \u201cnot wanting to\u201d sit next to me. (I\u2019m not saying you accuse of them not blaming you, just trying to think critically, which I\u2019m training in my university.) \n\n\nI\u2019m kinda studying intercultural communications and its breakdown, or what foreign people in Japan think of Japanese people\u2019s behavior. In general, I learn communication-related stuff in my university. \nThis is kinda common example of \u201ccase-study\u201d to me. Another typical example would be \u201cI\u2019m being stared by Japanese people\u201d or like misunderstandings come from our lack of English skills and the differences of cultures, etc......\n\n\nActually, I also found that people tend not to sit next to me in the train lol I\u2019m kinda worried and finding solutions now xD\nI also found that, like in bus, females tend to choose sitting next to females, not males, when there aren\u2019t available seats that they can use alone, like in the bus. I kinda observed it because of my curiosity about people\u2019s behavior. \n\n\nI should have made tl;dr or something, but anyways, hope this somewhat helps.
