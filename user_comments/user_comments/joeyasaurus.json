If they did it again it should be a weekend long event with limits each day on attendance. That said all the food and drinks we had was delicious and every booth we walked past looked great.

It was one of the methods I was taught in class and it was helpful to me for memorizing the meaning of words and individual characters.

So I would say do what you're doing, but make sure the meaning makes sense. \n\nSometimes the reason a character was used in a word that seems to not make sense with the meaning of that character either means it's a different meaning or sometimes it can be a historic meaning from ancient Chinese which is no longer used, but something you'll find about Chinese is they like to reflect on history in Chinese language. \n\nAnother important note is that in Chinese not always, but often people will use two or more characters instead of just individual characters, even if it isn't technically incorrect to use just one character. For example, even though the word chicken is \u9e21, when talking about the animal you will sometimes see it said/written as \u9e21\u5b50, with the \u5b50 essentially having no meaning, but making it a two character word.

It was okay just saying things like \"hello\" or \"how are you,\" but my foundation wasn't strong enough to start having full on conversations, which I was expected to do and failed at miserably. I felt a lot more confident after a few months in the language to start speaking and then my speaking took off and it's now my best modality.\n\n>How much time should be spent on reading vs. on listening?\n\nDepends on a lot of factors. For a non-alphabetic, character-based language, learning to read the language is tantamount to survival if you want to travel to or live in a Chinese-speaking country. Listening is also crucial for learning what the language sounds like, especially different dialects and accents. Another could be if you have a language-based job. If you are a translator who speaks all the time, maybe listening is more important. For me personally, it's a little of column A and a little of column B, but personally my reading is better than my listening and studying more listening causes my reading to suffer and vice versa. \n\n>Are SRS apps a waste of time?\n\nThe biggest problem I have with any language learning app is that they are great for beginners and that's it. It's hard to find apps for even intermediate to advanced level learners. Going back and reviewing the basics can be necessary at times, but going back to \"hello\" \"my name is...\" is painfully boring.\n\n>How important are grammar drills?\n\nIn Chinese, super important. Can you get away without grammar patterns? Sure, but you'll sound so childish in your speaking. Chinese speakers are easily impressed if you use a grammar pattern (even a basic one) or a higher-level word instead of a basic one. What I found is that most Chinese grammar patterns are just that, patterns. If you learn the basic structure and word order, you can just sub in other words and keep using the same sentence pattern over and over. This makes it easy to memorize even just 10 grammar patterns. \n\n>Is it inefficient to learn a language alone?\n\nThis one really depends on your learning style. For me personally, I always do better in a class that has structure and forces me to study. Others do quite well learning alone. I think at the very least everyone needs a speaking partner to practice the language with.\n\n>Are textbooks inefficient compared to apps?\n\nNo, again it comes down to learning style. Also know that text books tend to teach very formal language and in a certain way and can contain words, phrases, etc. that native speakers don't really say or would contest the usefulness of learning. For example in Chinese they teach you to say \"pleased to meet you\" but most Chinese speakers do not actually use this phrase. \n\n>What is more important: motivation or routine?\n\nFor me personally routine. I like a structured program that tells me what to learn, when to learn it, and what to study in order to progress. My motivation came from falling in love with the language and wanting to learn more and get better.\n\n>Is it efficient to \u2018soak up\u2019 a language without studying vocab or grammar?\n\nI don't see any harm in watching Anime or K Dramas with subtitles, but don't turn around and expect to travel to Tokyo or Seoul and talk to people or feel like you're fluent because you watched Studio Ghibli movies in their native language. It's not really efficient though. For me, I usually watch a show or movie with subtitles and pause to look up works periodically or add them to my lists of words to study if I think it's a good word to know.\n\n>When are you allowed to call yourself a polyglot?\n\nI can't really answer this. I got to B2 in Chinese and haven't been able to get higher. I don't consider myself a polyglot, but someone else might have only learned one language in addition to their own. Some people even dabble in a bunch of languages and consider themselves polyglots. I don't think it requires mastery, but I also don't know if a basic understanding is enough to say you speak it.\n\n>When are you done learning a language?\n\nNever. I still learn English words and phrases all the time and it's my native language.", "created_utc": "1628699042.0", "edited": "1628699262.0", "id": "h8jtmkj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_p2b3ho", "parent_id": "t3_p2b3ho", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "joeyasaurus", "body": "Mine was more wanting to learn a heritage language and then finding out it was really hard to learn and giving up early on.

There is also Pansexual which means they are not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity. It can be the same as bisexual or they identify as someone who is attracted to anyone.\n\nT - Transgender; someone who was born with male parts who identifies as female and may have male and/or female sex and reproductive organs or someone who was born with female parts who identifies as male and may have male and/or female sex and reproductive organs. \n\nQ - I've heard this one as queer, as in gender queer, meaning you don't ascribe to typical gender norms (i.e. androgynous people) or questioning, as in not sure what they are or where they lie on the spectrum, or could refer to gender fluid which refers to change over time in a person's gender expression or gender identity, or both.

This could be a person who identifies as male who dresses or looks more feminine sometimes, but more masculine other times or a mix of both.\n\nI - Intersex; Intersex is a general term used for a variety of situations in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn\u2019t fit the boxes of \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale.\u201d Sometimes these people were operated on as a child to \"fix\" this but some were not.\n\nA - This one is typically asexual and aromantic (also known as ace and aro).

There is also demisexual, which is a person who must first develop a romantic attraction to someone before they would be willing to date them or have sex with them.

I was in an 8 hour a day 5 day a week intensive course and it felt exactly like what you say. For reference my class was split up into 3 classes: 1 class was the smart class and the other 2 we jokingly called \"dumb class\" but our teachers hated us saying we were \"smart and dumb class\" because they wanted us all to succeed.\n\n> I was really looking forward to it, because I've just started B1 and really hoped to be able to improve my speaking a lot.\n\nYou can still improve your speaking, but you'll have to get creative with it. \n\n>the first teacher spends nearly the whole class speaking, so we barely get any chance to speak. And when we do, two students dominate all the time, to the point where it's impossible to interject, and the teacher just has no strategy or intention to deal with this.\n\nFirstly, this is going to hurt to hear, but class isn't the best time to practice speaking. What I mean to say is, yes you will be answering questions and giving input on the lesson itself, but if you think about it, that's not much time to practice. One way you can fix this is to only use Spanish during class. In our class we were encouraged to use Chinese, but were not discouraged from using English. Unfortunately that meant students who were struggling used English as a crutch. If you only respond in Spanish you'll get more speaking practice, albeit slim. \n\nAnother idea is to try approaching the two dominating students outside of class. In my experience there are two types of smart students: those who grasp the concepts and want to show off by dominating class time discussions and those who grasp the concepts and just sit there and chime in once in a while, but try to let others do the work for them since they already understand it. You could say something like \"hey you guys really seem to be getting this stuff, let's start a study group\" or \"maybe we could practice speaking together.\"\n\nOther than that, in your free time can you go walk around? If so, the best way to learn is immersion. Go out and explore and only use Spanish. Even if they default to English or whatever your native language is, respond in Spanish. They might switch to Spanish or stay in English, but at least you'll get some practice. You'd be surprised how much speaking you do just walking around to shops and stuff. \n\nThe last idea I have which may or may not work is requesting one-on-one time with the teacher. Certain times we would be allowed to have one-on-one classes with our teachers. I would use this time to practice speaking as much as possible. Sometimes it would be homework or studying, but other times we could do roleplays or I would tell them about recent news or describe things to them using the language or we might just chat about everyday life.\n\n>For example, we could have a 10 minute recap of a tense we learned a few weeks ago, but instead we spend the whole lesson on it. On the flip side, things we actually struggle with don't get any time.\n\nI would bring this up to the teacher. Phrase it just like you did. What I found in my class was certain teachers were more receptive to a \"hey we aren't getting this concept\" than others and some (especially older teachers) are stuck in their ways and are generally not receptive to changes in the curriculum. For instance with grammar patterns there would be hard ones we didn't understand. An older teacher from Beijing would just tell us to read what the textbook says, but it didn't explain enough. The example sentences were too simple, but the homework had harder sentences. A different teacher who was ~35 years old was willing to look online for some practice materials that explained it better and in a different way. You could also try going to Google or Youtube and seeing if any native speakers/teachers have materials that explain it better. \n\nAnother thing could just be that while you understand it, other students don't and the teacher can sense that or they've told them that and so the teacher feels like they need to go over it more, and vice versa for the concepts you aren't grasping. Or alternatively, the teacher is stuck in their ways and thinks students need more time on certain concepts than others (which I ran into a lot) despite knowing if their students truly are getting it or not. Native speakers, even teachers don't always realize how hard certain aspects of their language is to learn.\n\n>I guess, I'm just frustrated. I spend 4 hours a day at this course, and I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with my Spanish or making friends. Then I get home totally shattered after an exhausting day, and I'm starting to not even want to touch Spanish in my \"free\" time because it's starting to become unenjoyable.\n\nThis is definitely a feeling I had. I would leave class after 8 hours feeling drained. If I had a one-on-one and the teacher made me do speaking practice where I was doing most of the talking for an hour, my brain felt like mush. Then I would have hours of homework and studying. At one point I didn't think I could learn another vocab word if they used a plunger to force it in my head. It can feel daunting, but from what I get, you wanted a challenging course. Learning a language is hard, but this course, although you don't realize is helpful and it's what you make of it. \n\nIf you aren't getting joy out of Spanish anymore, try to break up the monotony. Find a Spanish show or some movies and watch those. Watch youtube videos in Spanish. Listen to Spanish music or a podcast. Try reading a Spanish book. I get more enjoyment out of learning from sources I like, but I also see the value in being forced to learn concepts in a way that's challenging.

The best advice I have for that is it's sort of like an IQ test. If you're good with word puzzles and picture puzzles that is kind of helpful (recognizing patterns, basically). Aim for at least a 110 (120+ though is best) if you want the pick of any language they offer.\n\n> Is it worth it to try and exhibit exceptional leadership and physical fitness capabilities at basic? Is this something that\u2019s documented or paid attention to for this rate?\n\nNo, and in fact this doesn't really matter for any rate. Boot camp is pass/fail for fitness tests and you really only need to pass the final one to graduate boot camp. Once you're in A-school you can possibly get a good bullet on your evaluation if you have outstanding scores, but I wouldn't worry too much until you get to your first duty station.\n\n> Would I be considered for the type of CTI that goes to SERE if I\u2019m color blind and my depth perception failed? I understand SERE isn\u2019t anything to be giddy about, but I don\u2019t want to be just an airborne phone operator if I can help it. Maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve, but I want to become something exceptionally valuable to the Navy.\n\nThis is kind of up to you. At boot camp, if you're lucky, you might get the chance to take the 2nd class swim qualification. If you do that and pass, in A school if you're lucky they might have a billet for Navy Air Crew that you might get. When I graduated we didn't get to choose our jobs, but sometimes if there are a lot of billets available they will give you a dream sheet and the highest scoring people in your class and sister class get first pick. For ours, the highest person got the best orders but everyone else just got random stuff. In C School they also grade your performance and use that to determine your job. It's like one part A school performance, one part C school performance, one part on the Chief and First Class to see what would be a good fit for you based on your reading/listening scores. If you don't get NAC right away, you can apply for it on your second tour. You don't need to have passed the swim qual to go to SERE school. You will do it in Air Crew school. As for the eye test, I think you'll be okay (but don't quote me). Your job is listening to people speak and translating it. That's all. It's not super glamorous, but it is super important!\n\n> I have a girlfriend of 1.5 years. Again, I\u2019m 24. This isn\u2019t quite Highschool romance. It\u2019s the one I\u2019ve decided to stick with in my young adulthood and feels very real and mature and long lasting. Is there time for that while at DLI? Or with this job in general?\n\nYes, at A school you will be very, very busy. It's easier when people are married because you can live together (but PLEASE don't rush into a marriage just for that). I arrived at A school in a long-distance relationship. It was hard, but I've seen people do it. It's something you should discuss with her. As for the job itself, yeah it has plenty of time to see your girlfriend or future wife. If you're lucky you'll work in an office 8-10 hours a day 4-5 days a week, or be on a variation of that depending on your job. When you're deployed it's harder obviously, but that's the military life.\n\n> When (If able) would I be able to request going back to DLI to learn another language?\n\nSecond tour or beyond that. Just tell your detailer when you're up for orders that's what you want to do. \n\n>How many times would I be able to do this?\n\nNot sure. I've only seen twice. Most people learn other languages on their own beyond that and usually it's either a) they're good at learning languages b) they knew a language (culturally) or c) it's in the same area/country as their first language\n\n>Would I be required to re-enlist each time? If so, for how long?\n\nYour first tour is technically 6 years (4 years + 2 years of training), but you will be up for new orders in 4 years and if you choose orders you will re-enlist then, or any time in your 4th year. After that, tours are typically 4 years and you will re-enlist each time.\n\n>Is it easy to get a job at a 3 letter agency?\n\nYes\n\n>Is that job high paying?\n\nDepends on the company or agency, but I was offered $100k with the lowest passing scores you can have, but I will warn you, I also have other skills because I worked a mostly non-language job for 5 years. \n\n>How often does the job you have require travel?\n\nI only have to travel twice a year, but some jobs are deployable. Depends on the language. Something like Arabic would be likely to be deployable at some companies, but Chinese, far less likely unless it's like CIA or FBI maybe? I don't know.\n\n>Let\u2019s assume I score very high on the DLAB. This supposedly makes me choose between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Though I\u2019m a lanky, pasty white guy with dummy thicc eyebrows and a nose that would probably be speaking Arabic if it could talk.\n\nYou will meet with a CTI Chief and they will tell you what classes are available. The available classes will be ones that have a class starting right after you get to A school. They won't want you to sit around for too long in holding division. If you score 120+, I got a 120, they will offer you any language and actually if you score higher they will discourage you from easy languages (i.e. Spanish), but if you're heart was set on a language, be vocal and tell them you really want it. Sometimes they can find a spot for you, but not a guarantee. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!", "created_utc": "1610322517.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gitco08", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kun78s", "parent_id": "t3_kun78s", "score": "2", "subreddit": "newtothenavy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v1a6"}, {"author": "joeyasaurus", "body": "NC has the largest tech boom in Raleigh.
