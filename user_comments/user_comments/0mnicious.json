I don't see the issue...    \nI was exaggerating the number of guns, but you're the DM you control how many you're willing to give out. 4 would actually be the ideal number.\n\n\nThe difference between that and using a bow is that a bow user can keep shooting (20 arrows costs 1sp, bullets/pellets cost much more for much less), they can keep thousands of them in a bag of holding or 60 in a quiver (which is equal to 30 rounds of firing arrows, nonstop, if you have extra attack), a person using those flintlocks will go through 2 pistols per round (extra attack) and will eventually need to go melee, or would have to save the guns for a certain situation and go melee first. It allows for a hybrid melee ranged fighting style that has a shit ton of flavour.    \nIt can be copied by using Bows, without any downsides. So I literally don't see an issue with wanting limitations AND wanting to have the flavour of using Flintlocks... Lets not forget that they also do a lot of noise (that's 3 negatives already, adding the time ooc it takes to reload, that's 4 negatives).\n\nFollowing your ideal, there's nothing stopping me from literally flavouring my character as a flintlock pistoleer but mechanically using a bow. And not only would that be mechanically superior in every possible sense than what I envisioned but also boring as fuck. Yet 100% usable with how you \"want to DM games\".\n\n________\n\nIf I were to DM a person wanting to pull the whole, semi-automatic pistol by using different pistols every time they shot then I'd hold them accountable for ammo and reloading times, as strictly as I possibly could.   \n5min per reload of each gun, means that in a SR they could do a max of 12 guns and during a LR they could do a max of 24 guns (only 6 of their 8 hours needs to be sleeping). But that means they can't do anything else. Do they want to be on lookout while their party members sleep and reload the guns? Disadvantage on perception checks, or -5 to the roll. Want to mend your wounds during a SR? Welp, can't reload 12 guns, only half that much. If you want to be stricter just say they spend the whole hour fixing themselves up and can't reload anything. Wanna use your Inspiring Leader Feat during SRs? Well that's 10min less for reloading. Want to use the Chef Feat to set some food up for the SR? Well hope you don't mind using 15min of your time. Wanna reload between combat while walking around? Disadvantage to all skill checks and Initiative, and take double the time reloading.

And both work with the Dueling Fighting Style, if you find a way to add it to your PC. If you don't know if you're going melee or ranged then its best to use the Dueling Fighting Style, since it procs both on melee and ranged, plus you don't need the Thrown Weapon Fighting effect of pulling out a weapon since the Psi Blades appear  in your hand when you attack (and disappear immediately after, which allows the +2 damage from Dueling to apply to your off-hand attack too!).\n\n>And what level would you recommend taking in ranger when leveling up?\n\nThat's the most complicated part of the whole thing... Rogue has really good and important Features early on.   \nYou can rush it after level 3 (but make sure you use Tasha's Optional Features for the Ranger). I wouldn't recommend this though, since you'd be postponing your ASI and other important Features.    \nPersonally I'd do it after Rogue 5 (Uncanny Dodge) or after Rogue 7 (evasion), you can do it after Rogue 4 (ASI) too.\n\nIf you're going for a melee based Rogue then I'd recommend going to 5 or even 7, but if you want to build your PC as a thrown weapon specialist, which is what I do with the Soulknife subclass, I'd go Rogue 4 (ASI) and then rush Ranger 3.\n\nRanger only gets a Fighting Style and Spells at level 2, so your 1st Ranger level will give you Favoured Foe (Tasha's), an extra d4 to your damage once per round that requires concentration which you can use PB/LR, Deft Explorer (Tasha's) 2 languages and expertise in a skill you are proficient in, and proficiency in medium armour, shields, martial weapons and one Ranger skill. Which isn't really a lot.   \nSo maybe if you're stating out it could be better to start as a Ranger 3, choosing Swarmkeeper and multiclass into Rogue. After that just keep adding levels levels to Rogue. You could also get Eldtrich Adept as your free Feat letting you get Armour of Shadows asap. If you do this, use Primal Awareness (Tasha's) instead of Primeval Awareness (base class Feature), it's more useful.     \nFlavour wise you could justify it as your Psionic powers manifest mainly defensively, with a little offensive power (the 1d6 swarm damage) and utility wise (mage hand, moving yourself & moving the enemy) and only after a level (rogue 3) your PC has managed to hone its offensive nature fully (using the Psi Blades) and further developed it's utility (Psi-Bolstered Knack & Psychic Whisper).", "created_utc": "1658582903.0", "edited": "1658584863.0", "id": "ihbjen2", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5x7m4", "parent_id": "t1_ihbgw38", "score": "1", "subreddit": "dndnext", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vbgl"}, {"author": "0mnicious", "body": "With Fey Wanderer I like to Multiclass Swashbuckler and become the ultimate face.", "created_utc": "1658571914.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ihb257d", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5x7m4", "parent_id": "t1_ihauly9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "dndnext", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vbgl"}, {"author": "0mnicious", "body": "I love multiclassing ranger, specifically the Swarmkeeper flavouring the swarm as Psi energy, with a soul knife as to get spells, the thrown weapon fighting style and Eldritch Adept feat choosing Armour of Shadows and flavouring it as Psi energy protection.", "created_utc": "1658563291.0", "edited": "1658584967.0", "id": "iharlzd", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w5x7m4", "parent_id": "t3_w5x7m4", "score": "0", "subreddit": "dndnext", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vbgl"}, {"author": "0mnicious", "body": "You can always add different equipment.", "created_utc": "1658445599.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih4a7k0", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4dwjf", "parent_id": "t1_ih2ly3x", "score": "1", "subreddit": "DBZDokkanBattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_384a7"}, {"author": "0mnicious", "body": "Wait, he gets exclusive equipment?", "created_utc": "1658445586.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ih4a6fz", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_w4dwjf", "parent_id": "t1_ih1bwmx", "score": "1", "subreddit": "DBZDokkanBattle", "subreddit_id": "t5_384a7"}, {"author": "0mnicious", "body": "~~Wildshaping into an Elemental uses your 2 Wildshape resources instead of 1.

So that's 3 additional ways to use your Reaction for an Attack, for 4 total ways to use your reaction to proc Sneak Attack.    \nUsing your BA is way less reliable and MUCH more limited. But since that' what you've asked, here are the ways I see one being able to do it:\n\n* Scimitar of Speed, but you need to get proficiency in Scimitars.   \n* Quickening a GFB or BB, but you need both the Meta Magic Feat and some way to get the Cantrips either through another Feat or multiclassing, which would net you both the Meta Magic and the Cantrips but only its use is extremely limited.   \n* Getting Haste cast on you or Multiclassing into Fighter for Action Surge, both work if you are dual-wielding.\n\nBut if you want to multiclass and/or get Feats then it's just better to get Sentinel and Multiclass into Battle Master, you can even get a Fighting Style to give you more uses and another Feat for it, don't forget Superiority Dice come back on a Short Rest, Sorcerer Points only come back on a Long Rest. Plus Multiclassing Fighter lets you get Proficiency with Shields.\n\nThe best way is to get Sneak Attack outside your turn reliably is with your Reaction.\n\nBattle Master makes it easy, especially so if you are a Swashbuckler, thanks to Fancy Footwork. Get Brace and Riposte, the last one either Precision Attack to increase the odds of hitting your few attacks or just chose whatever is more flavourable. For a Fighting Style get Superior Technique, and chose anything you want. If you want even more uses, get the Martial Adept Feat, for 2 more Manoeuvres and Superiority Dice.    \n\nIf you only get 3 levels in BM, you've got 4 SD that are d8s. If you chose the FS you get 5 SD, once being a d6. If you chose the Feat, you now have 6 SD, two of which are d6s (although I'd argue that since Metamagic Adept gives 2 SP Martial Adept should also give 2 SD, but that's something you need to talk with your DM). They all come back after a SR, btw. If you take the BM to level 10, then all your SD, even the ones from the FS and the Feat, become d10s.\n\nIf you Multiclass Sorcerer to 3, you get 3 SP, plus another 5 from your Spell Slots if you want to convert them. With a Feat, you can get up to 10. But since Quickened Spell uses 2 SP, you'll only have 5 uses, all of which only comeback on a Long Rest.

Is a Caster Concentrating while Casting and the Mage Slayer Attack forces the Caster to do a Concentration Check?   \nBut then, that would mean that Casters can't Cast any Spell if they are already Concentrating on a Spell.\n\nYou could break free from the rules completely and simply add what you recommended. But I'm not sure how strong or weak that would be. Like it can be extremely strong, but then again it can be utterly useless if a character doesn't have Expertise in Arcane.\n\nTo improve Mage Slayer I'd first fix it by allow for the Attack to be made before the Spell goes off, which by RaW it doesn't (this is the reason the Feat is pretty shitty).    \nAs a second change I'd allow the Advantage on STs to happen within 10 Feet of the Caster, to cover Characters that use weapons with the Reach property.    \nThirdly I'd make the Disadvantage to Concentration Checks to happen only when the Character uses Melee Attacks (as it is now you can be a ranged weapon user and it works - but this, imo, goes against the idea of the Feat since the other two points are benefits for melee weapon users).\n\nI'm not sure about interrupting Spells... I'm not really a person with a lot of experience in balancing things in 5e, I try to do it with a few changes in my games but I don't feel comfortable making changes that are this big.    \nThis idea kinda rubs me the wrong way because it's not really fun for the Caster.

Shadow of Moil is also really great. Hex is the typical choice but I'm not a big fan of it. Expeditious Retreat is great defensive option to never let yourself get locked down. Or you could even go the typical Darkness build with the Devil's Sight Invocation.\n\n* **Improved Pact Weapon** (prerequisites: Pact of the Blade) - Allows you to use a Longbow as your Pact Weapon, makes it your Spellcasting Focus, and if your weapon doesn't have any kind of +x it'll make it a +1 Weapon\n\n* **Thirsting Blade** (prerequisites: 5th lvl & Pact of the Blade) - Extra Attack, now you can attack as many times as a Ranger.\n\n* **Eldritch Smite** (prerequisites: 5th lvl & Pact of the Blade) - Paladin Smites on your bow, amazing vs flying targets because it knocks them prone without any Save. \n\n* Maddening Hex (prerequisites: 5th lvl & Hex/Hexblade's Curse/Sign of Ill Omen) - Allows you to use your BA for a ping of 5 psychic damage to an enemy you've cursed and creatures of your choice within 5ft of the cursed creature.\n\n* **Lifedrinker** (prerequisites: 12th lvl & Pact of the Blade) - 5 extra necrotic damage, on each attack \n\nOther good flavourful and mechanically interesting invocations are: Devil's Sight, Sign of Ill Omen, Mire of the Mind (lvl 5), Armor of Shadows, Shroud of Shadows (lvl 15), Witch's Sight (lvl 15), Mask of Many Faces, Ghostly Gaze (lvl 7), Eldritch Sight, and many others.\n\n______________________________________\n\nE: If you reach lvl 17, mystic arcanum for 9th level Spells, I recommend choosing Foresight to cast on yourself.   \nIt gives you Advantage on every Attack, Saving Throw and Ability Check, gives anyone that Attacks you Disadvantage and you can't be Surprised.

The trigger is Casting a Spell not starting to Cast a Spell. There's a big difference.\n\n>So in this case mage selects spell options, ie misty step to location X. The mage is now casting a spell, but has not spoken the verbal component to actually teleport yet. This triggers the reaction attack, which takes place before the spell component.\n\nExcept it doesn't. How does the the Mage Slayer know what the Mage is going to do? There's literally no trigger for him to follow-up on. The Mage in your example hasn't even used its Spell Component/Arcane Focus. Also the Verbal Component happens when Casting, not after you start Casting, it's simultaneous.   \nThe trigger is Casting a Spell, not picking up the Arcane Focus or choosing the Material Component or starting the  Somatic/Verbal Component of a Spell.  \nIf you were Holding/Readying your Action, sure you could do that but the Mage Slayer Feat doesn't state anything like that.\n\n>Nothing I\u2019m reading in reaction rules is indicating otherwise?\n\nI told you to read the Held Actions section too, which is part of the Reaction Rules as stated in the DMG (which I forgot to mention, sorry). There's also Xanathar's Introduction, which I forgot to mention too, my bad.\n\n\nJust look at the Held/Ready Action part, the DMGs and Xanathar's explanation on Reactions:\n\nPHB, Combat - Actions in Combat, Ready (p. 193):\n>\"(...) When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction **right after the trigger finishes** or ignore the trigger. (...)\"\n\nDMG, Running the Game -  Combat, Adjudicating Reaction Timing (p. 252):\n>\"(...) Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's description. For example, the opportunity attack and the shield spell are clear about the fact that they can interrupt their triggers. **If a reaction has no timing specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action.**\"\n\nXGTE, Introduction - Rules to Remember (p. 5):\n>\"(...) If you\u2019re unsure when a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here\u2019s the rule: **the reaction happens after its trigger completes**, unless the description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise. (...)\"\n\nThe rules are the same for all Reactions unless the Feat or Feature has a specific rule that goes against the general rule.\n\n\nSince the Feat doesn't state that the Attack made is done before the Spell is Cast we have to fall back to normal Reaction Rules. A Reaction can't interrupt its trigger, unless specifically stated that it does.   \nMage Slayer doesn't explicitly say otherwise, therefore a PC/NPC with Mage Slayer can't hit a teleporting Mage. \n\n \nIs this stupid? Yes, very, completely and utterly so, because it utterly fucks with the Feat, making it much, much, weaker than it is on a first look. This was clearly a fuck up on WotC's part. But by RAW Mage Slayer is nearly utterly useless.\n\nIf you want to fix the Feat, you're going to have to implement some new rules too. Like for example, during the Casting of a Spell is a Mage Concentrating? If you rule that they are then how can they Cast Spells while having a Concentration Spell up? See, this opens up a whole can of worms...   \nThis is a rule in previous editions but I can't find any Rules talking about this in 5e.\n\nPersonally I did a few changes to the Feat:\n\n* The Reaction Attack, though magic mumbo jumbo allows the Mage Slayer to do an Attack ignoring the distance to the target distance (it has to be a melee attack, though).  \n* I also only allow Melee Attacks (anything that is melee, so improvised weapon melee attacks, unarmed attacks, natural weapon attacks, etc) to apply Disadvantage to the Mage being hit (by RAW a ranged character can get this feat and only use this part of it, which goes against what the Feat is trying to do imo so I decided against it).\n* And finally, I allow Advantage on Saving Throws within 10 feet, in case the PC/NPC want to use a Weapon with the Reach property.\n\n\n_______\nE^1  \nI had formatted this better and given the pages of where all the info is but apparently my internet, or reddit, shit the bed and none of it stayed...
