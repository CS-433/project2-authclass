[{"author": "Xander2299", "body": "Well for one thing, mute all. I know you said \"Besides mute all\" but that tells me you're aware of the solution and haven't properly diagnosed the problem. If having chat on tilts you so much that it affects your mental health outside of the game, there is no reason to leave it on. I play with chat off and 95% of the time I need to communicate something, the ping system does the job well enough. Chat can be great but there is a high chance someone on your team will eventually use it to flame and be negative. This will affect the way you play the game and often snowballs easily winnable games into un-fun stomps, simply because you and your team no longer want to work together. \n\n\nChange your mindset by viewing your allies and enemies as bots, and reconsidering why it is you want to climb. Do you want to climb because you want bragging rights once you reach a goal rank, or do you want to climb because you want to recognize your improvement. If all you want to do is improve, then don't worry about the outcome of individual games. As long as you're improving, you will climb if you're playing consistently. Your teammates will make mistakes in every game you play (otherwise you'd be in the LCS) so you have to change your mindset from \"my team sucks every game and they are the reason I lose\" to \"the players in this elo suck, which means the 5 players on the enemy team also suck. how can I take advantage of this to win more than I lose.\"\n\n\nRecognize when you're tilted or not in the mindset to play your best. When you're in this mood, you'll probably start losing a lot and making bad decisions which is counter-intuitive to climbing. I started climbing when I reflected on why I enjoy playing League. I like making the right decisions and being rewarded when a play generates an advantage in my team's favour. If I'm frustrated with teammates from past games, if I'm distracted by something other than the game, or if I'm just queuing up because I'm bored then I won't queue for ranked.\n\n\n*Treat* ranked seriously, but don't *take it* too seriously. The game is meant to be fun, don't let it stress you out more than it provides you entertainment", "created_utc": "1666899787.0", "edited": "1666900208.0", "id": "iu13hfi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yf0nf2", "parent_id": "t3_yf0nf2", "score": "3", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3"}, {"author": "Xander2299", "body": "And then you'll wonder why the enemy knows exactly where you are and when you're coming in for a gank while you never sweep a single bush", "created_utc": "1666898924.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iu11a08", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yenhfz", "parent_id": "t1_itzc1np", "score": "2", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3"}, {"author": "Xander2299", "body": "I watched one of your Nocturne losses, here are some notes:\n\n- Work on your jungle clears, most of the time you sit and AA the camp without moving. Kiting camps towards where you want to go next will save you a lot of time and health, especially for your first clears. Additionally, with Nocturne, since your Q gives you a speed boost, if you're going to kill a camp with it aim it toward your next camp. Same idea. I saw you use your Q on wolves toward mid lane and then run up to Gromp.\n\n- 3:47 to 5:17 in this entire time span you farmed the enemy raptors once. You looked to gank top, that didn't work so you cycled to mid, that didn't work either so you took raptors, went top again, and got a Q off on Gangplank. My own personal improvement in this game started when I began using my time more efficiently. I think you could have actually gotten Gangplank here, but you chose the wrong path toward top. You chose to walk through river over the enemy scuttle instead of up around Baron pit. If you had gone that way instead, I think that would be a successful gank.\n\n- 5:40 Nocturne's Q trail also gives him extra AD, but you threw it into a wall instead of standing on top of it while you fought the krugs. Always use the trail for that extra damage and clear. You do it a couple times throughout the game.\n\n- 7:13 you take red and go to dragon. You saw J4 on scuttle and even though you have bot prio, your top side jungle has been up for a long time. I would take my top side jungle first to put it on cool down and buy items to take dragon faster next time around. You did end up getting it, but it was risky, and if you continue to make plays like that they will cost you games down the line. Dragon is a great objective but I usually only like doing it early game when I know for sure that it is not only safe, but I am also not giving up other resources somewhere on the map for it. If the enemy comes to catch you off guard it could turn the tide of a game and make it not fun to deal with.\n\n- 8:30 you gank the Gangplank with your ult, but I would argue you didn't need to use it. Gangplank has no flash and you should easily catch him with your Q and E, as well Shen has him taunted. If you hold your ult until you really need to use it, then you will have it more often for better plays.\n\n- 9:30 you farm scuttle crab, meanwhile Jarvan walks very obviously over a ward in mid. Things like this are why map awareness is very important. You go to gank the Syndra, over commit to it, and end up dying as Jarvan gets there. So this was a play that failed because of 2 mistakes. #1 you didn't have your ult for the gank, which might have made it work, because you wasted it top. #2 you didn't see that Jarvan was in the area, which you didn't factor into your decision to commit to getting the Syndra. If I were in this situation I would have cleared my gromp and recalled because you're sitting on 1.7k gold.\n\n- Throughout the game you use Nocturne's W haphazardly. It's a spell shield that blocks important abilities of the champion you're fighting, so try to hold it for when you think the enemy is going to use their ability you want to block. It takes practice and timing, but it's a crucial skill you need to learn if you want to use Nocturne properly. \n\nIt was really fun to look through but wow it took me way longer to type and watch than I thought. I would have loved to look at it all and make comments but I don't know if I'm qualified nor if I have the time. \n\nJungle is a hard role but it is worth it to learn if you want to climb. Learn how to clear the jungle properly, learn your champion (pick 2, main 1, and trust me you will climb once you learn them well), constantly be aware of the state of the game through map awareness, think critically about timing and usage of abilities, and never force things if you're not sure about it. And always try to use your time efficiently. League is a game about information and how to get more gold than your opponent with that information. If you improve on those alone I believe it will be easy for you to reach Gold.

I understood that languages aren\u2019t just 1-to-1 translations, but until I was surrounded by the language and actually started speaking it, it wasn\u2019t apparent just how different it can be. You really have to start \u201cthinking\u201d in the language, which I think I finally understand the meaning of. For me it doesn\u2019t mean that my conscious thoughts are in German, I haven\u2019t gotten there yet, but you have to be able to instinctively build sentences without thinking of the translation. You need to translate feeling instead of thought. What is the information you want to convey, and what words + grammar do you know that will convey that message. A quick example in German; if the weather is hot and I want to translate from English, \u201cI am hot\u201d would become \u201cIch bin hei\u00df\u201d, but it should be something like \u201cMir ist hei\u00df\u201d or \u201cEs ist mir hei\u00df\u201d. I need to find that sentence without consulting English first. This has been the biggest change I\u2019ve noticed in my mindset and progress since I\u2019ve been here and it feels very liberating now that I\u2019m here. But there is still lots to learn.\n\n\n*Mistakes are essential*\n\nSpeaking is the most fun part of a language, and you need to make mistakes to improve. This isn\u2019t groundbreaking and I think everyone knows this, but simultaneously I think you need to experience it yourself to truly figure it out. At first I was a little shy to try to say things because I felt like an idiot when I made mistakes. But as you make mistakes, as long as you pay attention to the corrections, you will make those mistakes less and less. Most people don\u2019t double check for their wallet until they\u2019ve lost their wallet. I also think speaking is the ultimate demonstration of what you have learned. If you can use a word or a grammar construct in a conversation then I think it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019ve truly learned it. Maybe not perfectly, but enough to make mistakes with it and solidify your understanding. \n\n\n*Start with flashcards, and move on to reading*\n\nFlashcards are great for the beginner stages of language learning, but reading becomes better. At the height of my motivation I had about 2000 flashcards in 2 months which gave me a great passive vocabulary to build off of. But soon those flashcards became extremely boring and I didn\u2019t want to look at them again. Now it is so much more fun to read a book and learn new vocabulary through the story + in context rather than tediously grinding out flash cards. The next language I learn I am probably going to do flashcards until I can read an A2 graded reader and then move on from them. \n\n\n*You are essentially a child again*\n\nYou need to separate what you want to talk about from what you are able to say. In other words, practice your language at the level you are at. In English I might like to talk about philosophy and politics, but I would hardly know where to begin in German. You need to adopt the mindset that you are essentially a little kid again that needs to re-learn everything. If you constantly try to use words and grammar that you haven\u2019t learned yet, or haven\u2019t learned the underlying rules for, you\u2019re not going to do yourself any good. There was a guy in my course this month who was very intelligent in his mother tongue, but consistently tried to create sentences that were too complex and use C1-C2 level words. The teacher constantly had to correct his work and the things he said because he just wouldn\u2019t learn the basics first. By the end of the month he finally got the idea that you have to walk before you can run and started progressing much quicker. It\u2019s frustrating not being able to express yourself the way you want to, but language learning is a marathon not a race.\n\n\n*Grammar is hard but it eventually becomes second nature*\n\nThe German cases were very daunting for me until it finally clicked. And then you realize that native speakers don\u2019t necessarily know what to say because they\u2019re perfect with grammar, they know what to say because it sounds right. The more you learn, the more things begin to just *sound right*. If I heard \u201cmit das\u201d I know it\u2019s wrong because it *sounds* wrong. Mit is always followed by der , den or dem. I am including this because I think it demonstrates that as long as you dedicate time, you will learn.\n\n\n\nSo there are my thoughts after 1 month of structured language learning in a course. I think there is more I could say, but I will leave it until I can prove to myself that I am able to achieve C1 and show that I can put my thoughts into actions. I highly recommend a language course if you can do it and travelling to a country that speaks your TL.", "created_utc": "1656747856.0", "edited": "1656752578.0", "id": "iejxlne", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vpmg0t", "parent_id": "t3_vpmg0t", "score": "43", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "Xander2299", "body": "Thank you for pointing me in this direction!", "created_utc": "1656661442.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iefcjd6", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_vo5vi2", "parent_id": "t1_ieb0a9q", "score": "1", "subreddit": "wien", "subreddit_id": "t5_2scoa"}, {"author": "Xander2299", "body": "Why though?

Learning multiple languages at a time is certainly possible but I would only recommend it for someone with a few languages in their asenal, as far as I know. Also since Japanese and Arabic use completely different writing systems I\u2019m not sure learning both at the same time would be very efficient or optimal. Through learning 1 until about B2, you start to understand what a language really is and what it means to *learn* a language plus some of your own personal preferences which can then be applied to additional languages you learn. Keep in mind the language learning process takes years if you\u2019re serious about it.\n\nMy personal recommendation on where to start with learning a language is to look up a list of A1 vocabulary and create flashcards (or find existing cards online) and look up flashcard learning strategies. I haven\u2019t learned a language with a different writing system so if you go with Japanese or Arabic first, you definitely need to get those alphabets and systems down primarily.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t take you too long to learn 500 of the most common words with the help of flashcards. Also learn some common useful phrases that you can regurgitate word for word. After you have a few words in your pocket start looking at A1 grammar resources. You can really look at grammar as early as you want but I find it\u2019s easier to understand grammar once you understand a few words in that language better. \n\nI\u2019m no expert so I won\u2019t give much advice beyond the beginning stages, but you\u2019ll find that language learning can have any structure you want.

I don't really have much issue with those runs. The weekend for me is my time that I get to have some better sleep and wake up a bit later, and since the sunrise is around 5:30am I don't see myself waking up as early on the weekend as I do during the weekdays since Friday-Saturday nights are my free time fun nights. Maybe it's just cause of the global pandemic and lock down, but talking to my friends at night is the only social interaction I've gotten for the last year+ now. I've been going out around 7:30-8:30am for my morning weekend runs and it's already pretty hot by then. Last night I did actually go for a run in the dark and it wasn't so bad, but then my issue is that I'm running Saturday night and then instantly running again Sunday morning without much recovery time. I can't run on Sunday night because by the time the sun sets, I'm already getting ready for bed for work on Monday.\n\n\nSo I guess the solution then becomes \"just suck it up and wake up early on the weekend too\" but I really need my weekend sleep for my mental health, and while I do love and enjoy running as a hobby, it's not like I'm training for anything like the Olympics.
