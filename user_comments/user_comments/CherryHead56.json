[{"author": "CherryHead56", "body": "Double Negatives are usually only used in informal speech. There is nothing wrong with using a double-negative when talking to a friend. You wouldn't use double negatives when talking to your boss, or in any situation that requires formal speech. Anybody saying that double negatives are completely incorrect is incorrect.

Native American English uses double negatives fairly frequently, and natives will almost universally understand you if you use a double negative, therefore it's fine. For example, in Southern dialects of American English and in African American Vernacular English, it's extremely common to hear double negatives such as \"I didn't see nothing\" or \"we don't want nothing\" meaning \"I don't see anything\" and \"I don't want anything\" respectively.", "created_utc": "1666744983.0", "edited": "False", "id": "itspcm3", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_yd8sx3", "parent_id": "t3_yd8sx3", "score": "5", "subreddit": "ENGLISH", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjni"}, {"author": "CherryHead56", "body": "Japanese, Icelandic, and German.
