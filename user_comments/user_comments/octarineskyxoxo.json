It's basically a bunch of word order rules, but it makes the whole language, so it's so difficult to get a good feel for something more complicated than just \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\nAnd don't get me started on the particles\n\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e08\u0e30\u0e15\u0e32\u0e22", "created_utc": "1661821592.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imbvdda", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wzxm82", "parent_id": "t1_im53mr1", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "octarineskyxoxo", "body": "Time to remember\n\u041f\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0445\u0443\u0439 \u044f-\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e (\u0441)\n\n[A legendary interaction ](https://sun9-64.userapi.com/impg/k7B0zM3ffozDtUavrUwEiatS2iNv4ZFUOOkgxA/xLKwvxDLEG8.jpg?size=443x604&quality=96&sign=0ad18bc2bc1e4527e427d2895fc9b0c1&type=album)", "created_utc": "1661724443.0", "edited": "1661724645.0", "id": "im6kw6e", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x02fy3", "parent_id": "t3_x02fy3", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "octarineskyxoxo", "body": "Here's people suggesting Duolingo [for Finnish grammar ](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyglot/comments/w3119n/so_im_new_to_language_learning/igtqtwu?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)", "created_utc": "1661617550.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im0p2pf", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wz481q", "parent_id": "t1_im0ohm9", "score": "7", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "octarineskyxoxo", "body": "I fear that it is unironic", "created_utc": "1661617303.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im0ohm9", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_wz481q", "parent_id": "t1_im0c516", "score": "6", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "octarineskyxoxo", "body": "Yes, you're gonna drown", "created_utc": "1661609984.0", "edited": "False", "id": "im06u34", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_wyvgts", "parent_id": "t1_ilzccay", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearningjerk", "subreddit_id": "t5_37rt5"}, {"author": "octarineskyxoxo", "body": "It's definitely possible!

I'm mostly focusing on comprehension now (listening and reading), so our goals differ. But I have experience in language learning as well.\nI'd say there are probably going to be two major difficulties for you: tones and grammar.\nI know that Chinese grammar is considered to be easy. It is, in some way, bit if I'm not mistaken, it is drastically different from all the languages you have experience in. It's an isolating grammar, which means there are no morphemes, conjugations, nothing. Meaning is conveyed via word order. There are also counters/measure words, complements of result and direction, which are quite different from the other languages you know. It's not difficult to understand, but definitely takes time to master.\nAnd then tones, which is absolutely crucial. It's the part of the word that you can't ignore, and no one can say how long it's going to take you to master tones.\n\nI had easier times with both of those because right before that I learned Thai - it's tonal and has similar approach to grammar and grammatical concepts.\nBy now I've been studying for 3,5 (closer to 4) months, I know around 1100 characters and around 2000 words (probably more, but that's passive vocabulary). I spend around 3 hours every day on Chinese and by that I mean active study 85-90% of that time: textbooks, learning vocab, reading native content and such.\nIf I focused at least 1/3 of that time on speaking, I'd probably be able to have a decent conversation about day-to-day stuff and such, maybe a bit deeper.

Zhan Zhehan's controversy was a mess in the worst of ways. Censorship is also quite a thing in itself.\nBut, for learning Chinese there is a big online community who mostly does it for the danmei content. Written content, mind you, mostly web-novels, and encouraging people to begin reading native novels as early as N4-N5. It's one of the most dedicated, hard-working and warm communities I've been in. With them I got from a poor N3 level to N4 and started reading my first native novel (I'm 130k characters in by now). We do watch dramas and such, but in a very chill way.

Knowing Thai helped me with Chinese tremendously even though they are not from the same language family.\nBut the resources for learning are scarce, as are learning communities (I was pretty lonely during the two years I was actively studying) and Thai BL industry, even though I love it, is a bit better, but not THAT much. There is also regular drama, both with obsessive fans (some of the actors broke up with their girlfriends as a result, for example) and sometimes with production teams (a couple of cases of harassment or allegedly worse) and even a couple of lead BL actors who said or did some homophobic things. And some people get really uncomfortable with how the actors made to deliver all the fanservice and how the lines between the real life and fiction are blurred.\nThere isn't censorship, that's true, the overall attitude towards lgbtq+ is much, much better, but still, there are some nasty surprises out there, sadly. I believe if you'd switch from Chinese to Thai expecting it to be much better, it might disappoint you at some time. I personally believe the community you're in matters a lot.

There are also vocabulary decks for those two books on memrise (an SRS system) with audio, so learning them gave me around ~1000-1200 of my first Thai words and from there on I just started reading with a dictionary and watching series with subtitles.\n\nI'd say the easiest part is the grammar + vocabulary. Not vocabulary's spelling, but that if you learn the word, you're pretty much ready to go and there is usually not that many synonyms in the spoken language, so you don't need that much to start getting the grasp of what's being said \n\nThe toughest part for me suddenly was the writing system, somehow I struggled with smoothly reading it more than with kanji/hanzi.

The catch is, you have to do it the right way for you, but that applies to any learning method.\nI'm finishing Checkpoint 3 after ~5 months (I had some previous knowledge from 8 years ago when I started, but it was less than A1), and a couple of days ago I successfully passed a mock test for Japanese N4 (it's their analogue of CEFR and you can very roughly translate that into A2). My N4 is yet not that good (110/180 with the passing score of 90), but it's still a pass.\nAnd I'd say Duo is responsible for ~60% of that. Yes, I did additional studying - learned vocabulary with memrise, wrote kanji, read textbooks and occasional grammar explanations and watched anime, but most of my additional efforts were centered around consolidating what I got from Duo. \nSo, of you want to learn with Duo, go for it and see for yourself. My advice would be:\n- spend time on it. Not the advertised 5-15 minutes, but, like, at least 30. If you get bored, go use some other resources that day.\n- look up the waterfall/hovering method in the duo subreddit. You don't want to level every lesson up to gold before you move on to the next, that's mental torture, but you want to level them up eventually.\n- as soon as the lesson allows you, start typing in your target language/voice your answers to speech-to-text. It's easy to use pre-made tiles and get correct answers, but starting crown 2-3 Duo gives you opportunity to construct dozens of sentences in your TL from scratch with immediate feedback. Use it, I believe it to be the most effective part. People don't like the translation part of the learning, but I believe that comparing and understanding differences between the languages is nice.\n\nHope any of this helps, happy learning!

I personally find the second one more satisfying, because you clear out a whole area of knowledge. I remember watching, like, four or five seasons of House MD straight while still improving my English and to this day the show is responsible for all the anatomy, disease and hospital procedures vocabulary I know. White Collar and Person of Interest got me well-versed in crime and punishment (obligatory Dostoevsky joke).\nI'm nowhere near to that stage with Japanese (I'm between N5 and N4 atm) and yet genre anime already teaches me a lot of more niche vocabulary, like \u9b54\u6cd5\u4f7f\u3044 or \u6b66\u5668 because I find it relevant and want to know them even before it's \"my level\", because it's used in my favourite things.", "created_utc": "1639656975.0", "edited": "False", "id": "horsjwi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_rhmi13", "parent_id": "t1_horm6rq", "score": "8", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "octarineskyxoxo", "body": "Oh, I feel like I've faced the similar problem while learning Thai at the higher stages (though I'm not proficient still). I'd say that the hardest part is figuring which words should be learned, so I'd like to offer my own input on that, feel free to use them or discard them.\nBasically it's all the task of hand-picking the ones you want to learn. \n- It's a good rule of thumb that whenever in some piece of media you come across the word enough times that it annoys you to look it up AGAIN as you clearly remember already doing it, you should write down that word and learn it. Chances are, you'll be seeing it a lot in this one.\n- Choose specific areas of knowledge and learn a bunch of vocabulary from it. For example, I know that I like detective/crime stories in any language, so once I didn't know what to learn I made a list of crime-related vocabulary. And it was a good idea because eventually a got to watching a crime show.\n- When you stumble across the word and you think 'oh wow I want to know it', you should learn it. Even if it's obscure and rare. If it sparks joy in your brain for whatever reason, chances are, it will stick with you much faster. And chances are you'll run across that same word sooner than you'd think. I remember how I learned the word for torture in Thai and was like, well, I guess I won't need it anytime soon. The following days I discovered that like four of five songs in my playlist had it in the lyrics. Oh man, the serotonin I got from it.\n\nSo I'd say the main idea after learning the core 1k-3k is to learn words that you absolutely want to. Because they're fun, or because you like their meaning, or they belong to areas of your interest or maybe at this point you're sure it's going to save you a lot of looking up.

It's totally my personal experience, but I feel like being able to recall the word both ways really helps me to be more familiar with the language, even if you then only need the word for recognising it later in the input. The connection is stronger and it doesn't take that much time to learn the word both ways. You make a link between a concept in your native language and your target language, and you're just making sure you can run it both ways. And in time the word connects to the meaning/concept directly, cutting out the translation part.\nRecently I've returned to Japanese after years and years of not learning. For me to most easily and confidently recall a kanji in a written text, I need to learn to write it from memory. Then we're, like, best buds.\nAnd before that I've been learning Thai like that, with learning the vocab both ways. I'd say acquiring vocabulary of ~3500 words in less than 1,5 years is pretty speedy, so imo it's not that big of a deal with saving the time.
