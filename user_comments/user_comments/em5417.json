When I'm sad and overwhelmed, and my husband says, \"hey, what's wrong? Is everything okay? Are you okay?\" Etc. I get frustrated because the questions are too fast and frequent. So maybe ask once or twice and then say something like \"it's okay if you don't want to talk right now. I'm here whenever you want to.\"\n\nTry asking more specific questions \"are you feeling sad? Tired? Overwhelemes\" rather than \"what's wrong? Also, it is not an age appropriate expectation for a 7 year old to be super articulate when they're upset. I'm 28 and I have a hard time explaining what's wrong sometimes when I upset!\n\nYou dont need to know what is wrong to offer empathy. \"I can see you're upset this morning, and I'm here for you if you need to talk. Would you like a hug before putting on your clothes for school or afterwards?\"\n\nSlow down. Yes the morning is busy and you all have places to be. Take 5 minutes, slow down, sit down next to your child or get on their eye level and then ask how they are feeling. Offer to just sit with them in the feeling for a minute or too. Then when time is up you can empathize and say \"I can see you are still sad, and I wish we could just be here together longer, but unfortunately it is time to get ready for school. What we can do to make this easier for you?\" Then offer choices: breakfast then get dressed or the other way around? Wear some special clothes? Have a hug? Invite them to solve problem.\n\nAs for the hug, obviously your child wasn't bring rational, but that's because they were triggered. You had already been yelling and upset. They weren't thinking clearly,  so yelling again to get them to move so you can give them a hug isn't helpful. It sounds like you need to refocus on yourself. What is your self care like? What do you do when you start to feel upset? How do you become grounded again?\n\nIf being late is a chronic problem, you need to look at how your morning is structured. Most likely your child needs more time to emotionally connect with you before being rushed out the door. And, your stress and anger is only escalating the situation. I would be grumpy in the morning too if I knew I would get badgered into my clothes and yelled at for asking for a hug.\n\nLastly, I want to flag you saying \"i hate myself\" several times in your post.

A lot of kids have a regression at that age because they start working on walking. I guess I'd be curious to know of your goal for being all in now? For me, I went all in at 16 months, because that's when it was clear my son was ready for it. Prior to that it was too stressful for him, and that's okay. Better to move at the pace of your child than force them into something they're not ready for.\n\nAlso, if you feel you are a very controlling person, perhaps consider therapy to work through why? Beyond EC, it is incredibly stressful to grow up with a controlling parent. My mom was that way and it took me years of therapy as an adult to work through an anxiety disorder I developed in response to the fear of upsetting her my whole life.

Feel proud of that! It is hugely stressful to hear someone scream and not get provoked. You're doing a great job.\n\nSecond, It may just be something she has to grow out of, or there may be other things to try.\n\nA few questions: When you talk to her once she's calm, do you ask her why she is screaming? Or what she is feeling while she is screaming? I think it is great to talk about the impact on others, to help build empathy, but perhaps she is lacking insight. In other words, if she's been reacting this way, it might just be habit at this point. Perhaps getting her to reflect on her experience can help break the cycle. What does her body feel like before she screams? What does she feel like afterwards? Are there other ways to make herself feel that way?\n\nOne other thought: it is great to talk about other ways but toddlers/preschoolers need practice. There's research to show that practice tantrums are really effective. Basically instead of just talking about punching a pillow, you'd play act the situation. Maybe something like \"ok so you're really really mad, how many times do you think you could punch that pillow? I bet you could do it 10 times!\" Then when she does it, praise her for it. Some kids respond to a little playful teasing as well like \"wow! You did that 10 times! Surely you cant do it 10 times AND as quietly as possible.\" (Obviously with a twinkle in your eye and a playful tone). More praise once she's done it that way. Then in the moment, you're reminding her of a game she has already physically done, rather than an abstract concept.\n\nAs they say, neurons that fire together, wire together, so you need practice to help rewire different responses in the brain. My guess is that \"no+strong emotion = scream\" in her brain and you need that repetition to wire new things together.\n\nEverything I'm talking about was pulled from a Yale parenting course, so none of this is my idea and it is all research backed.

Defiance implies that a person is refusing to obey an order or command given by an authority. It frames the behavior from the child as essentially saying \"No! You're not in charge, I'm in charge!\"\n\nAt 2.5, gentle parenting philosophy would look at this as poor impulse control. You don't reason and rationally convince a 2.5 year old or even a 4 year old. That's not developmentally appropriate because the ability of their prefrontal cortex to regulate their amygdala is literally not developed yet. For lack of a better example, it is as effective as explaining to your beloved family dog why it cant have another treat, and then viewing the dog grabbing the treat as defiance. There is a mismatch between your expectations and the capabilities of your child.\n\nSo, what do you do instead? Gentle parenting is NOT reasoning with your child and convincing them instead of \"do as I say so.\" It is holding boundaries while acknowledging the real experience of your child.\n\nIn this example, your child thought it was a game, so your only option is to calmly unstack the chairs or remove them from the situation. If they were upset by this, you would take the same action and focus on validating the feeling rather than a long safety explanation. \"Yes, it is sad when you have to stop doing something fun, but this isn't safe. It's okay to be sad, but you may not climb. Would you like to climb on this safe thing over here?\"\n\nFor crossing the street, I made up a little song \"We hold hands when we cross the street\" and sing it every single time we cross the street. At first it was a fun game and my son was happy to play along. Then one day, he didnt want to do it and tried to cross without me. I scooped him up, and reminded him of the rule. He got mad and started to cry. I just said \"I can see you're upset about holding hands, but it isn't safe to go by yourself. Do you want to hold hands or should I carry you? You're not able to walk and hold hands, so I am going to carry you.\" That happened a few times and he decided it was more fun to hold hands and sing.\n\nHe's 2. He has no ability to understand the risks of running into the street, but we use simple words \"not safe\" and simple requests \"hold hands\" and the rest is consistency and practice. We go for a walk every day and I make sure we cross the street when we do so we can practice this. I also explicitly teach him things like what he can climb or can throw so it is easy to redirect to in an emergency.\n\nWhen he doesnt want to hold my hand, he isn't being defiant. He just cannot regulate himself that day and his desire to run by himself is overwhelming.

No pressure, no asking 1 more bite, no pleading or bribing, no sit here at least X amount of time. They eat as much as they want and if that means nothing, then that is okay.

In the same way that it was normal for a young baby to cry the second you are too late in feeding it. It takes time and brain development for kids to learn how to self-regulate their emotions.  \n\n\nIn public, it sounds like you are doing the best you can. Maybe just add the phrase \"I can see you are really upset. I'm right here if you want a hug or want to take deep breaths with me.\" And then sit down if possible, so you're at her level and not towering over her, and take deep breaths. Will it be embarrasing? 100% this happened to me the other day in the literally grocery store and I thought I was going to melt into the floor and die. But if I saw you doing this I would be thinking \"wow! that mom is being so calm in the midst of a hard circumstance. Good for her! Her daughter has a great example.\"\n\nAt home, create a calm down corner. Look on youtube, instagram, or pinterest for ideas about what to include. Basically it is a safe space that you can encourage your child to go to so they can take a break and feel their emotion. Kids NEED to feel their emotions. So do adults. Therapists are in high demand these days because we have generations of people who are afraid of or were taught to hate their emotions. A calm down corner creates a safe space to feel the emotion without hurting themselves or others.   \n\n\nFor me, I had to redefine what success looked like for my strong willed son. Instead of \"it was a successful trip to the park because we came and went without a fuss\" I've had to accept \"it was a successful trip because when my son melted down I stayed calm, but held the boundary and didn't fall into the negotiation trap\" as my current goal. I still haven't found a way not to be totally embarassed when it is happening though!  \n\n\nAgain, none of this is stuff I thought of.

She describes at the end a lot of self doubt about what she can say in response to her son who doesnt want to put his shoes on and go to school, but to me it just read like over thinking. Also, where does gentle parenting teach that if you get this wrong your kid ends up a drug addict? I felt like she really overstated the stakes.\n\n\n2) where in gentle parenting does it blame all bad behavior for stress? She seemed to think when your kid is upset you always have to say \"you feel sad. Where is that sadness coming from?\". Maybe? But also there are times where you say \"I know you hate putting on your shoes. I can see you are feeling upset about it. It is okay to be upset, but we have to out on shoes. Do you want to do it or should I? Okay, you dont, so I'm going to do it.\" \n\nYoung Kids can't engage in the kind of psychotherapy talk she describes. That's why child therapists use sand trays, art therapy, play therapy etc to explore that \"deeper level\" with little kids. Gentle parenting isn't asking parents to constantly make their kids dig deep to understand what's behind every emotion, as if the parent is a therapist. It is simply asking parents to acknowledge the emotion, instead of judge it, criticize it, or punish it as was done in previous generations. \n\n\n3) Some of her critiques describe permissive parenting, so that is why that doesn't work.\n\n\n4) She frames it like it is all or nothing. Studies have shown that parents need to be responsive like 64% of the time to have a positive impact. I felt like she put so much pressure on herself to be the perfect gentle parent all the time so of course she is burning out! I have absolutely had days where the best I could do is say \"you're mad. I'm sorry. Unfortunately we are leaving now.\" And then I haul my toddler to the car as gently as I can muster. I've had days where I dont say anything and just walked out of the room after my toddler wacked me across the face. I was mad because it hurt and I needed to calm down. Did he feel abandoned? Maybe? But only for like a second and in that moment, taking space was the best I could do. I didnt hit him back or yell at him, which is what would have happened to me as a kid. In my book, my response is still in the spectrum of gentle parenting, and it didnt require me to neglect myself as she suggests.\n\n\n5) I felt like she WAY over analyzed the \"dont praise\" advice. Like in general you dont want your kid to think love and acceptance is conditional on their performance, but that lesson is also learned when they are \"being bad\". Not putting your kid on ice, or shaming them, or isolating them when they are not behaving well also teaches them about unconditional love. You cant control teachers, grandparents, bosses etc. saying \"good job\" to your kid, but you can make it clear that you love them even when they've haven't done the right thing. You can also enthusiastically mirror back to them. \"You feel so proud of yourself for climbing that hil!!! Yay!!! That's awesome.\" I dont see why it is hard for her to find alternatives to \"Good job\"\n\n\n6) where does gentle parenting say to ignore the child who was hit? If my son hit his sibling, 100% of my first response is to the sibling! Create some space between the kids, check in with the kid who got hit, and then turn your attention to the kid who is hitting.\n\nOverall I felt like she created some false dichotomies and made it seem really black and white, all or nothing. My understanding is that gentle parenting at its heart believes the job of parents is to set health boundaries and provide a safe space for kids to feel their emotions, while maintaining those boundaries. The specifics of how that goal is achieved will vary based on culture, language, age of kid etc. That doesn't seem that controversial to me, and I think the author is overthinking this, which is why it is stressing her out.", "created_utc": "1648231504.0", "edited": "1648232322.0", "id": "i23etn9", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_tntc1y", "parent_id": "t3_tntc1y", "score": "126", "subreddit": "AttachmentParenting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxsh"}, {"author": "em5417", "body": "The problem is not her husband's request it is how dogmatic he is being and the fact that he is using resentment and anger to get what he wants.\n\nOP's husband should be working collaboratively to find a good solution.

Since we've tried a couple of things to figure out what you're asking for but we haven't found it, we're going to....\" and then I either move on to an activity he likes, offer a snack if I think it is food or take him outside. 99.9% of his problems are solved by popping outside for even like 10 minutes.  \n\n\nSometimes he's just upset and wants to cry about things without there being something to fix! Just like we like to vent to our friends and family.   \n\n\nAnd sometimes I say \"I can see that you're upset and I don't understand why. I'm really frustrated and upset so I need to put myself in the calm down corner and then I can better help you.\" If I can't be there for him, because I'm human, I try to verbalize that I'm at my limit. I started this even when he was an infant and couldn't understand anything because I needed the practice!   \n\n\nAttachment parenting is not about making sure your baby never cries or is perfectly understood 100% of the time. That wouldn't set the up for success in life. It's about meeting their needs as best you can, and supporting their feelings with love when those needs can't be met. I have found Dr. Becky's \"Good Inside\" podcast SO helpful. It doesn't really address young infants but the mindset she talks about can be translated to that age. You're doing a great job!

It's entirely possible you have a totally different meaning and experience with that word.\n\nAn 8 week old crying because they are over tired, want to be held, want out of their carseat etc. is not having a tantrum, if you're using my definition of the word. They are expressing a need in the only way they know how. Unfortunately we can't always meet their need in exactly the way they want, but it is perfectly normal and appropriate for them to cry and express sadness or frustration over not having their need met in the way they want. \n\nIn fact I would argue the whole concept of a tantrum is delegitimizing to any age child's feelings.

I found that he didnt have a consistent sleep schedule until closer to 6 months.

When I tried a stricter schedule it just meant I spent an hour trying to get him so sleep rather than 15 minutes and he still slept at the same time. Your child's body cant create  enough melatonin at 2.5 months to manage their circadian rhythm, so the idea that a bed time routine influences their internal clock is literally not possible at that age.\n\nEven now that he is 18 months I let him lead when he goes to bed. We have bedtime routine and some night he does his routine, hops in bed and nurses to sleep. Other nights we do the routine and he wants to play a bit before sleeping. I just think of it like my own sleep. Sometimes I am more tired because I had a long day or exercised a lot. Other days I'm wired and need time to wind down. I do make sure the room is lit only with a small lamp or night light once we start the bedtime routine because that seems to help. I also make sure that he gets active stimulating play for about 30 minutes before the routine. He's an active kid so we literally need to chase him around the house some nights before he sleeps. That started around 8 months or so, but at 2.5 months you could just do some face to face time and get a lot of giggles out.\n\nThe one thing I try to keep semi consistently is when he wakes up, because that tends to set the tone for the day. But even there I make exceptions if needed. What's great is since about 10 months he will tell me when he is ready to sleep. He crawled/walks to the stairs to go upstairs or walks to the bed. Now he'll literally stand up and say \"night night\" when he is ready. I have never forced him to sleep at a particular time so bedtime is not a stressful thing.\n\nI think as long as the atmosphere is calm and darker around bedtime your child will find their rhythm.

I learned about this from a parenting classes by some researchers at Yale. \n\nBasically when he is calm, you say something like \"let's play a game. Remember yesterday when you were so mad you hit Bobby? I want you to pretend you are so mad again, but this time I want you try hitting this pillow as fast as you can. Then we will pause and take 2 deep breaths! Let's count to 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,....10! That was awesome! Okay 2 deep breaths! Great! Now let's do it again as fast as you can! 1.....10! Wow you let that anger out in a safe way! Can we try 3 deep breaths??\"\n\nMake it fun and use lots of positive reinforcement for the good behavior. If your kid is the type that responds well to a bit of reverse psychology you can always try a playful \"I bet you can't possibly do it faster this time! Look at you! You did!\"  That sort of thing.\n\nThey recommend doing that once per day.\n\nThen, be on the look out for when your son is getting escalated BEFORE he's at the point where he wants to hit, and offer the safe hitting game as an option. \"I can see you're getting really frustrated. Do you want to pause and play the hitting game we practiced? Let me get this pillow for you.\"\n\nKeep increasing the deep breathing as your son gets better at it. Remind him \"it is so great that you felt frustrated but you punched the pillow and not mommy. When we feel mad and we want to hit, it is okay to hit the pillow. It is not okay to hit ourselves or others because that hurts!\"\n\nWhen he's mad, it is important to praise anything that is a step in the right direction. Maybe the first step is that you offer the pillow, he pauses and thinks about it, but then tries to hit you anyway. Once he is calm, acknowledge that he paused and that is a huge step, but then reinforce the boundary and keep practicing the game.\n\nI have not tried this with my own son as he is 15 months, but my sister is an LPC who worked with children and teens who had experience severe trauma that led to serious behavioral issues. They would use some variation of this for the kids, and adjust it accordingly as they got older. It was really effective, but it is important that you are communicating a firm, but loving boundary, rather than fear, anxiety, judgement or shame.\n\nHe's 4 so his ability to understand the harm he is causing others is still limited. Once he gets through this phase, he will hopefully stop hitting AND have learned a really helpful technique for calming down.\n\nI'll see if I can find the course I was talking about.\n\nEdit: FWIW the researchers strongly recommended against just putting kids in time out to cry it out and calm themselves. If they knew how to calm themselves down, they wouldn't be hitting in the first place.

Like people who yell, or emotionally eat, or whatever when they're upset dont just stop. They redirect themselves to something healthy like deep breathing exercises or going for a walk, or journaling.\n\nYou need to find a substitute healthy behavior for the hitting rather than just saying he has to stop it.

I totally get that for some parents, sleep training is necessary for the family to function.\n\nMy personal opinion is that sleep is developlemental and depends on the baby like every other skill whether it is rolling over, walking etc. Depending on where you live, feeding to sleep is considered normal. My husband is south indian, and his mom nursed him and his siblings to sleep until they were like 3. Everybody in the village did it. What you're describing sounds normal to me. I think \"drowsy but awake\" is generally a lie as I know very very few parents who that actually worked for.\n\nTwo examples: My brother had a ridiculously hard time sleeping as a kid whereas my mom could literally set me down and I would sleep. That lasted until I was 6 months or so and then I needed some help.\n\nMy SIL and I had babies at the same time and mine has always been the \"easier sleeper\".

Do you have enough support so that you can support your child's sleep in the way they need? If not, could you get support in other ways? \n\nIf the answer is that you cannot get more support and you need your child to sleep for your sanity, then maybe sleep training is the right path for you. But personally, I would explore if there are people to help me during the day so I can get a break during the day, but be there to help my kid sleep.

Think of how exhausting that would be you and for them! They're not perfect and what is as important as learning the right way to treat others is learning how to take responsibility for when you mess up and ask for forgiveness.\n\nIn my family, we follow a little formula that we model to our son. (We actual got this from couples counseling.) It would look like this in your circumstance.\n\n\u2010--------\nAfter everyone has cooled down, in front of your child you say to your husband something like:\n\n \"I'm sorry earlier when I got upset and yelled at you. It's okay for me to feel XYZ feelings, but it is not okay for me to yell. Can you help me understand how you felt?\"\n\nHusband: \"Thank you for apologizing. When you yelled, I felt (hurt, upset, attacked, scared etc.)\"\n\nYou: That makes sense. It is really (repeat the feeling) to be yelled at. I'm really sorry for making you feel hurt, attacked etc. when I yelled this morning. Next time, I will...(take a time out when I feel upset, count to 10 before I speak, ask for a break earlier etc.) Would you please forgive me?\n\nHusband: I forgive you. I don't want you to feel overwhelmed, so maybe next time we can...(continue to problem solve if needed).\n\n------\n\nOur counselor recommended this approach in part because we came from families that were really focused on assigning judgement and blame. (If you're such a good person, why would you yell?? And that sort of judgement). In this model, the focus is on both parties articulating their feelings and is NOT focused on blame, judgement, or assigning objective right or wrong. It models for yourself and for your kids that our actions impact others, but when we take responsibility  for how we hurt other people, they can forgive us and we know there is no lingering unresolved issue.\n\nThen the troubleshooting can start so we can prevent further blow ups.\n\nThese skills are as valuable to your child as getting it right the first time and articulating themselves calmly.

If it isn't gone after that sessions, I'll return to that side and nurse again 45 min to an hour later of my baby is interested and keep massaging that spot.

He and his siblings almost always napped with other people in the same room, in people's arms, wrapped in a saree on his mom's back etc. as infants. They slept independently eventually and are all well adjusted adults now, so don't feel like you HAVE to put your child down for every nap or you are ruining them.

So far, it is going really well.\n\nWe knew he was ready because when we put him in the carrier, he no longer needed us to bounce him and sing to fall asleep. Starting about a week ago, my husband and I realized that we would put him in the carrier at nap time and he would fall asleep on his own in a matter of minutes. Additionally, he sleeps well at night. For bedtime, we lay him on his side car (we cosleep) and I nurse him to sleep. Sometimes if he had nursed recently, he would just snuggle to sleep.\n\nSo we decided to try those same things during the day. I waited until he was telling me he was tired. (He has a different cry/fussy sound that he makes when tired.) Then I put him in his sleep sack, laid him down in his bedtime spot and laid next to him. The first time, he fell asleep without nursing after about 15-20 minutes. The next time, he nursed for about 2 minutes and fell asleep. The third time, he nursed a little longer because it was time for a longer feed and then fell asleep.\n\nPersonally, I think sleep is developmentally driven, not just habits and behaviors. Before this latest growth spurt, it was literally impossible to get him to nap on his own. I'm glad I just stayed patient and waited for the next growth spurt.

Here are a couple of thoughts.\n\n\n1. SIDS is not the same thing as death because of suffocation. Many studies fail to distinguish this and so their data is skewed. \n\n2. SIDS is increasingly understood as a problem where the baby's brain stops telling it to breathe while in deep sleep, thus the sudden death with no explanation.\n\n2. According to studies done by the WHO, cosleeping actually decreases the risk of SIDS when done safely. That's because there is a risk whether the baby is in their crib by themselves or next to you. However, if they are next to you and you are breastfeeding your bodies are super in sync. Your body will help regulate your baby's breathing, thus decreasing the risk of SIDS.\n\n3. The risk of SIDS is tiny. I know it is hard not to worry about because it seems so scary but you are more likely to be struck by lightening twice in your life than die of SIDS.\n\n4. If you have a normal healthy baby in safe sleeping conditions your risk is super small. If you have a high risk baby, then yes cosleeping could increase your risk, so maybe put baby next to your bed in a bassinets.\n\n5. In general the risk is highest until after 4-6 months, but again it is a tiny risk. There will always be those exceptions and it is heartbreaking, but that doesnt change the risk to your specific baby.\n\n6. Overheating can potentially contribute, so if cosleeping dont swaddle your baby and dont over dress them. Check your baby's temp at the back of their neck. It is normal for their hands to get cold. \n\nOthers in the community can provide additional info, but hopefully this helps.\n\nFor more info in the science of cosleeping read \"Safe Infant Sleep\" by Dr. James McKenna", "created_utc": "1608028389.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gfwroqw", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kdiysv", "parent_id": "t3_kdiysv", "score": "55", "subreddit": "AttachmentParenting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxsh"}, {"author": "em5417", "body": "I had a lot of tearing that got infected and I got a UTI which is why I ended up back at the hospital. It was the weekend and I was in SO much pain and my OB couldn't see me until Monday so they said to go to the ER. Some antibiotics cleared all that up and I didnt have to stay overnight but with Covid we didnt want to bring the baby to the ER.\n\nFor syringe feeding I just inserted my left pointer finger into my baby's mouth nail side down on his tongue and waited for him to latch and stay sucking. Then with the syringe in my right hand, I gently stuck the nozzle next to my finger and slowly squirted it into the side of his mouth. That's how they taught me in the hospital. When my mom did it while I was back at the hospital, he didnt like the finger and just sucked the milk out of the syringe, so she removed her finger after he got started.\n\nIn my experience as someone who can easily produce an oversupply, the advice from the LCs in the hospital (and a lot of advice on forums like this) didnt work for me because it makes the engorgement worse. I finally found a good LC who helped me understand how to help my body regulate.\n\nIf you're not super engorged, just feed from one side and the next feeding use the other. Keep your baby close to you as much as possible through baby wearing, holding etc. Because their physical contact actually helps our bodies regulate. After a couple of days, your body will produce less and the engorgement will go away.\n\nIf you're really engorged, try block feeding. Feed your baby on demand but only from one side for 4 hours. Then do the same on the other side. After 8hours, go back to alternating and see if that helped. If you're still super engorged, do that cycle again. Pay attention to how your body responds. Some women find block feeding dramatically impacts their supply very quickly, so be careful doing too many cycles of this.  \n\nI strongly recommend do not pump to empty the breast after baby is done or to empty the other side. It makes the problem worse because your body produces based on demand. If you have a super forceful letdown, use a Hakka (or a generic version of same) on the side you're not feeding and that might get you a couple of ounces to store. At least for me, pumping made it so much worse so I had to just live with fuller breasts for a couple of days. \n\nIf you're very uncomfortable while you're body is adjusting, apply cold compresses to your breasts and try laying on your back to let gravity help.\n\nHopefully this helps!", "created_utc": "1607866308.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gfoy4yy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_kc6lup", "parent_id": "t1_gfoma0r", "score": "1", "subreddit": "breastfeeding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rdj4"}, {"author": "em5417", "body": "My baby never nursed longer than 10 minutes and only on one side from birth.

It is your body and you don't owe him an explanation. He does not have the right to control you or order you around. You are completely within your right to declare that this is how you want to breastfeed and he can get over it.\n\nBut your question was about how to convince him, so if that is your goals then I agree with @brentgilby. It might help him understand you if you also understand his perspective. My husband was also weird about it at first and I responded by being annoyed and defensive. That didnt help. When i eventually asked him to help me understand, he explained how in his culture he had just never seen women breastfeeding in public. In his case, he needed time to get used to the idea, and now he doesnt mind.\n\nif your goal is to help him see and appreciate your perspective, I'd definitely want to know how the event went down from his point of view. That might give you more insight into what issues to address.\n\nA final thought: does he normally respond to your disagreements by just giving you a cold shoulder? If that's the case, that might make it very difficult to resolve future parenting disagreements. I grew up with a dad who \"iced\" us and it was awful. Even when he was mad at my mom, I felt like I had done something and blamed myself. It can be hard on a child.
