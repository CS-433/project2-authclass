He uses what's called spaced repetition as well as incorporates Grammer with his flashcards. Go through his schedule of flash cards. Read that book and you'll be miles ahead of people trying to use duolingo. DON'T USE DUOLINGO IT'S TRASH. I never had good luck with Rosetta stone, but Pimsleur is good for pronunciation. \n\n2. You need a grammar book for beginners I recommend Russian Course by Penguin.\n\n3. Use Forvo.com to get pronunciation right or luckily for you you have family that actually speak Russian.\n\n4. Try to speak with natives all the time. Have your family only talk to you as much as possible in Russian and have fun with it and embrace the culture, memes, music, traditions.\n\nForgot to mention to start a goal of memorizing the top 2000 most common spoken words in Russian.
