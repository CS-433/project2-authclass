I would advice against using beginner resources and instead suggest that you go straight to actually using the language. You could try spending ten hours each on listening, reading, speaking, and writing (preferably with corrections on for example r/WriteStreakGerman, LangCorrect, or by a tutor), perhaps in combination with working on the grammar topics that you have forgotten in a grammar workbook. If your speaking feels too rusty to start speaking with people, you could kickstart your memory by trying some shadowing or echoing first. \n\nAfter your have done something like that, it will be easier for you to assess your weaknesses, how much you have lost, and what you should focus on to get back to the same level you were or even improve.

The more distant the language is from your native language, the more you'll need to support the immersion with other methods of learning as well. This is why a native English speaking child may successfully pick up Spanish from TV, but not Japanese.\n\nWe first started letting our children watch TV in the language they were learning when we saw how other children in our area had learned English by watching TV before formal English education had started. My children are native Swedish and English speakers living in Finland and all kinds of immersion programs, hobbies and activities in Finnish and playing with Finnish speaking children at the playground did not seem to be effective in teaching them Finnish. They were mostly immersed in Swedish (a minority language in Finland) and formal education in Finnish as a foreign language hadn't started in school yet. When my oldest daughter was seven, my middle daughter to was five and my son was three, they started watching TV in Finnish and within a year they were all speaking it. Because the languages come from different language families, I doubt that watching TV in isolation would have worked. The Finnish they picked up from the environment and immersion programs was most likely helpful even though they didn't appear to be learning much until they started watching TV in Finnish.\n\nMy children have since learned German in a similar way, with most of their exposure coming from TV. The second most time has been spent with a tutor and they have occasionally tried other methods as well, like playing around with Duolingo. \n\nHundreds of hours of watching anime in Japanese doesn't seem to have been as successful though. My oldest daughter is very much into anime and loves watching it, but doesn't speak much Japanese at all and it's difficult to judge how much of it she actually understands. She'll probably need a lot more actual study to learn this language because it's from a language family that's very distant to that of her native languages.\n\nEdited to add: Peer influence is another important factor in how successful the results tend to be. My children live in a highly multilingual environment where many and perhaps even most of their friends speak at least two languages, many three or four and are learning one or two more.

Instead, they have learned this language through media and interactions with native speakers. They used to go to a Finnish-German immersion after school program for 2-3 hours per day and now they take lessons via Skype twice per week. In addition to this, their main media language is German at the moment, which means that if they want to watch a TV show or movie, it's probably going to be in German. They occasionally listen to audiobooks in German or read books as well. When the travel situation improves, we plan on taking them to Germany every summer for more immersion.\n\nThis has worked out well for us and they can now communicate in German and understand German TV shows very well.

Playing games and doing hobbies in the target language also works great.\n\nPoint 6: You don't even have to be studying the same language as your children for this to work.

The 5-8 year old will start understanding more and speaking in longer sentences, but still obviously not be close to the same level as in their native language.

Others (again myself included) are surrounded by children who speak 2-4 languages and children who started speaking a language they had only been exposed to through media.

Age-appropriate audiobooks are also good, especially the type for young children where there is an accompanying picture book and a sound let's you know when you should flip the page. As your child gets older, you could introduce TV shows and even set it up so that the only TV your child watches will be in the target language. \n\nIf possible, exposure to native speakers from a young age is very beneficial. You could try looking for things like target language playgroups or activities in your area. If you need an occasional babysitter, try to find one who speaks the target language. Bilingual preschools and schools are great if that's an option where you live. Hiring an air pair is also an option. If none of these options exist in your area or suit your family, you could also find an online tutor to work with your child when they get old enough to pay attention to a teacher online (typically age 5-8 depending on the child). \n\nThe most important thing is consistency. It may seem like your child is learning nothing and all your effort is a waste of time and money, but don't give up. If they have had enough exposure (preferably daily) they will eventually learn. My oldest daughter went from seemingly not having made any progress to speaking in full grammatically correct sentences from one day to the next.\n\nETA: My three children speak four languages to varying degrees.

Their Finnish is now close to native level and I fully expect them to be indistinguishable from native speakers in a few years because they start school in Finnish this fall (they went to school in Swedish before this until we moved).\n\nThey have learned German mostly from TV/audiobooks and online lessons a couple of times per week.

They have a quite high level of comprehension (advanced for age appropriate topics, the official exams include adult topics and are not relevant for measuring the skills of children) and can have conversations in German, but still make quite a lot of grammar mistakes.\n\nWe started with Swedish and English from birth and then introduced Finnish from when my oldest daughter was seven and my son was three (they had had some low level exposure to the language before). Our son is now six years old and he mixes the languages a lot more than our older children, but he will likely grow out if it. Some exposure to German was added at the same time as Finnish for my oldest daughter (Finnish-German immersion after school program), but the amount of exposure to German was increased around a year ago. This means that for us, it took around two years for our children to become proficient enough in Finnish for us to consider adding another language.\n\nEdited to add: It is a lot more difficult to teach a child multiple languages in a monolingual environment. For our children, speaking multiple languages is the norm and they are far from the only children we know who speak four languages. The vast majority of their friends speak a least two. This is not necessarily the norm in Finland as a whole or even in the area where we live, but happens to be the case in our social circle. Typically, their friends will speak some combination of Swedish, Finnish and/or English and possibly another language if one of their parents has a different native language than those.", "created_utc": "1624776559.0", "edited": "1624777369.0", "id": "h36sonp", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o8gcub", "parent_id": "t3_o8gcub", "score": "4", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "Please read our wiki about this topic or post on r/thisorthatlanguage", "created_utc": "1624604337.0", "edited": "False", "id": "h2yy1dy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_o7ffs2", "parent_id": "t3_o7ffs2", "score": "1", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "I spent three months in Kentucky more than a decade ago and there were some people that I couldn't understand at all.

At the moment I am working my way through the Finnish translation of the Warriors book series by Erin Hunter because my daughter loves those books. In general, I think that book series are a good choice for learners because many of the words are repeated over and over again throughout the series. On book series for children that I would actually recommend is \"Taru Silm\u00e4ter\u00e4st\u00e4\" by Karin Erlandsson. It's written by a Finn, but the original is in Swedish. The Finnish translation is really good and the four part series is an enjoyable read also for an adult. It won a bunch of awards when it first came out. It's also nice that it is available as both an e-book and an audiobook so you can listen to the recording while following along in the text.

Most of the comments on this post were written by people who actually managed to read the whole thing because I fixed the error more than 24 hours after it was posted.\n\nMy family moved to Finland when I was a child, but we lived in the Swedish-speaking part of the country and I was completely surrounded by Swedish, not Finnish. I studied Finnish in school from the age of nine and my grades were actually quite good, but I still couldn't actually communicate with people in real life and had trouble understanding the language. I've looked at some approximated conversion charts and I think I at that point was around a B1-level, possibly a low B2-level after a few compulsory Finnish courses in university.\n\nAt this point I was very discouraged and didn't think I had any chance of actually learning the language to a (to me) acceptable degree. I had pretty much given up and spent a few years pretty much pretending to be a foreigner in front of Finnish speakers (which was easy because my name is not Finnish or Swedish and my husband is from the States). I didn't straight up lie, but didn't correct them when they made assumptions. Lying by omission I later found out is the expression for that. \n\nAt this point, I had moved to an area with a majority of Finnish speakers, so I was passively exposed to the language a lot more. Still, I mostly interacted with Swedish or English speakers and most services I needed were also available in Swedish, so my exposure to Finnish was quite limited. There were things that were poorly translated or simply not available in Swedish though, so I found myself more and more frequently using the original Finnish source to look up important information. At first it was mostly in written form, but then I started to feel a need to understand more and more of the spoken language as well and thus going out of my way to get more input.\n\nThis lead to me having a quite strange level of Finnish, where I was confidently reading quite complicated texts at a C2 level, but sounded strange during the rare moments when I attempted to speak. It was only now that I actually started incorporating the techniques I had used while studying other languages and started studying Finnish more actively. I started watching TV shows and reading non-fiction in Finnish. I also started reading the news in Finnish every day. I started speaking Finnish, actually first with language learners and not native speakers because I was more comfortable doing this. I didn't actually practice writing although this is recommended if you want to reach a C2 level. I only got to C1.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have incorporated TV shows and non-fiction much sooner. If you're working on getting from B1-C2, I would actually recommend using perhaps even the majority of your time on this type of input because if you focus too much on reading and more formal speech, you'll end up sounding strange when speaking yourself. There aren't very many learning resources for this level anyway (if any). Subtitles are ok in the beginning and it's good if you vary the material (TV shows about different topics, soap operas, movies, talk shows, cooking shows, the news, documentaries, audiobooks...). Only after a solid listening comprehension level, I would move on to focusing on reading. I think I made it way too difficult for myself by skipping the TV show phase of language learning and going straight to very advanced material that I needed to understand. Having a need to understand the language is a very effective motivator though.", "created_utc": "1623910477.0", "edited": "1623933911.0", "id": "h226e6o", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_kn8ga4", "parent_id": "t1_h21ohtl", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "Specifying the country made it possible to actually look this up.

I speak Finnish and German at a C1 level, which is fine for 1-1 interactions, but still puts me at a disadvantage when speaking with native speakers (especially in a group setting). Even though I speak English at a C2 level and use it daily, I am still at a disadvantage when in a group of only native speakers, especially in a country where English is the dominant language. This was especially evident to me when I went on a solo trip to the States to attend a conference. At one event, we were supposed to introduce ourselves and say something about our background. This seems easy enough, but I still managed to miss some social cues and laugh too late at a joke because it took me a while to get it.\n\nIn some cases, the choice of language will be influenced by what language puts neither of the speakers at a disadvantage. For example, one of my children has a close friend whose mother is a native Latvian speaker. She speaks Finnish and English at an obvious C2 level and also speaks Swedish (I am guessing around a C1 level) because her husband and child are native speakers. It's still obvious that she is more comfortable speaking Finnish and English than Swedish, just like I am more comfortable speaking Swedish and English than Finnish. We still haven't really settled for a default language and will switch between all three in a conversation, but still tend to fall back to English after a while because this is the one language we have in common that puts neither of us at a disadvantage and we have similar expressive power using this language.\n\nPolitical views can play a role as well. For example, if I am interacting with someone who I know has political views that include a desire to effectively remove the culture and language of the Swedish speaking Finns from Finland, I will be very unlikely to speak Finnish with this individual.

Most people who speak multiple languages most likely do so because of their particular life circumstances though and then it matters more how useful a language is for you at that specific moment. \n\nFor example, I studied some Dutch because I lived in the Netherlands, but never reached even an intermediate level in this language before I moved on to Russian because I had Russian friends and wanted to go on vacation to Russia. Then, without ever reaching an intermediate level in Russian, I moved on to French because of a planned vacation to France that has been postponed. \n\nI have reached higher levels in other languages because I have had a need to speak those languages at a higher level.

Finnish was a subject taught in school, but other than that my only exposure to Finnish was the labeling on the packaging and the street signs and some Finnish TV channels that I had to click past to get to the Swedish ones. \n\nThese areas are very small though and as an adult there is a lot of information that is only available in Finnish and, unless you want to limit yourself to certain small areas of Finland and also severely limit your options for work, you do need to learn Finnish.

But active skills... it's just so hard to judge for yourself. \n\nI also personally find it more difficult to accurately judge yourself at lower levels, but maybe that's just because I have not taken any exams at a lower level. I didn't feel that it was worth the money and time (including travel time) to take a lower level exam, even though I considered taking one in French this spring. Now I kind of regret not taking it though because at the next opportunity to take the exam I will, if all goes well, have an infant and it will most likely not be possible for me to take any exams until I am comfortable being away from my child for a full day. Seems like I will miss the Spanish exam I had planned for the fall too, unless the exam center somehow is willing to make a lot of extra accommodations (such as a private room and time extensions if needed). It may be possible because last year only one person took the Spanish exam, but still... it's very hard to concentrate when you're attending to the needs of a newborn, even if they sleep most of the time", "created_utc": "1617309734.0", "edited": "1617310190.0", "id": "gt2lw16", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mfe559", "parent_id": "t1_gt0ps4r", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "I just found this today.

In general, we do try to take the views of the community into account while making moderation decisions and one of the best ways of voicing your opinion about certain content is to report it. All of the moderators are volunteers with limited time to spend on moderation and as such we rarely have time to read everything on the subreddit. \n\nReporting content that breaks the rules or is questionable, ensures that at least one moderator will take a look at it eventually because the post or comment will end up in the moderation queue. This can actually be helpful for us moderators because we don't need to spend extra time looking for that type of content and because especially multiple reports tells us something about what the community thinks about that type of content (in addition to the down- and upvote system and the comments).\n\nEspecially detailed or accurate reports are very helpful. For example, a post that simply gets reported as low value added content may lead to a removal of that particular post, but if the post instead gets reported as breaking the rule about posting self-owned content too often, we'll know to check the post history of that particular poster and if it turns out that they are in fact spamming the subreddit with self-owned content, they may get banned.\n\nNote that sometimes posts of low quality that otherwise would have been removed are approved because they have generated an interesting discussion in the comments.\n\nFinally, as an answer to your question: No, you don't have to necessarily click on the link yourself before you report questionable content if it is something that you have reason to believe is unsuitable or disallowed content.", "created_utc": "1616537332.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grzcaa8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_mbe2ve", "parent_id": "t1_grylg86", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "Hello, u/WorldWideUniverse, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.

He said he got to play video games and eat pizza in some lounges and never had any issues. Did you fly with the unaccompanied minor program that you pay extra for so that someone is assigned to making sure you get where you were going and generally helping you? My husband only flew as an unaccompanied minor within the US and not on intercontinental flights though, so I'd want to wait until the children are older and more used to flying. They'd have each other as company, which definitely helps, but still... It's a long way.\n\nI don't think they consider those children natives, but also children who learned a language elsewhere are allowed in the class. In the classes for other languages, I think there is a higher percentage of actual native speakers.\n\nOur children have been going to school in Swedish, but we are about to move and the only schools that are nearby are in Finnish, so they will start a new school this year. Hopefully that will work out fine for the children and their Finnish skills will definitely improve this way. If they don't like it there, we'll make the longer drive back to their old school that is in Swedish, but one of my daughters did not really like her class because there were a couple of mean girls there and she didn't make any great friends, so I think a change of school will be a good opportunity for her to make some new friends. Our son is starting first grade there and he would barely have known anyone in the Swedish school his siblings went to anyway, so I think it will be fine for him. When they are ready to start high school, they can choose which one to go to. The Swedish one in the area is one of the highest rated in the country, so maybe they'll want to go there. Then for university, they should have many different options within Europe or the States.\n\nMy English pronunciation is quite good after having received a lot of feedback from my husband over the years, but I still struggle with certain words such as \"iron\". I definitely have an accent though, but supposedly Nordic people in general speak English quite well and not with too strong of an accent, so your children are probably going to be fine either way living in Sweden.\n\nBecause I am married to an American, I am entitled to a green card (if I otherwise meet the requirements) and just have to apply. The application process is quite lengthy though and involves different ways of proving that we are a legit couple (easy because we have been married for so long and have several children together), a background check, vaccinations and health check ups, proof of that my husband (or another co-sponsor) can support me, and an interview at the US consulate in Helsinki. After you get the green card, you have around a year to actually move there and after living there for a few years you can apply for a citizenship. If you're not married, you can apply for a fianc\u00e9e visa and get married in the States and then you get your green card.\n\nOne thing that you should be aware of if you are planning on moving to Sweden is that there is a shortage of housing especially in the main cities like Stockholm. I am not closely familiar with all the associated issues, but a couple of people I know had difficulties with finding suitable housing when they moved to Stockholm and people can be in a queue to get a suitable apartment even for years.\n\nGood luck with your plans and I hope it works out well for you!", "created_utc": "1616404223.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grsk2xf", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m9fbjc", "parent_id": "t1_grs7wl9", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "I have considered sending the children to summer camps in the States as well, or on an exchange year during high school, or all of us moving there for a while, but we'll see what we actually end up doing. The children love going to the States and spending time with their relatives. I wouldn't consider sending a reluctant child who hates it there over for the summer, but so far they are really excited about going. The oldest two are already old enough to fly as unaccompanied minors on certain airlines, so that is something we have considered as well, but it is a really long flight, so maybe when they are older.\n\nBilingual schools work for some people and it depends on the school. My husband was strongly against sending our children to a bilingual or English language school because many of the teachers were not native speakers, but this of course depends on the school. Their English for native speakers teacher is a native speaker, but many of the participating children had quite weak English skills and from my understanding many of them were not actually native speakers but had perhaps learned some English while living abroad or had non-native parents who taught them at an early age. This of course influences the way the children speak as well and can in some cases be detrimental (I mean for the native speakers whose English gets influenced by the non-natives).\n\nMost of my husband's family lives in Texas, so that's usually where we go for vacation and to visit family. Sometimes to Colorado to go skiing with family and occasionally other States where he has relatives such as Florida or Kentucky. If we were to move there, we'd probably end up in Texas, although we have considered moving to Alaska as well. Just about a year ago I started working on my green card application because we were seriously considering moving there, but ultimately decided to stay in Finland after all.\n\nYeah, I don't expect you to run into very much racism in the larger cities. Why are you considering moving to Sweden?\n\nThank you! :) They don't speak any Spanish (yet) though, but have started understanding bits and pieces of it.\n\nAbout the names, we have tried to go for names that work pretty well in both English and Swedish. The pronunciation and spelling is a bit different though and we have not consistently gone with either the Swedish or English spelling of the names, but chosen Swedish spelling at times and English spelling at times. One of our children has a more traditional Swedish name and we're expecting another one and so far the names we are considering are more American. It's not typically a problem because English and Swedish are close enough, but the names also need to work in Finnish and that's a bit more of a problem because native Finnish speakers tend to stuggle a bit more with certain names and letters.", "created_utc": "1616389435.0", "edited": "False", "id": "grs4pa7", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m9fbjc", "parent_id": "t1_grr2t6a", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "We're using an online homeschool resource called easy peasy all-in-one homeschool for their English language education and it's been working well for us. The older children have also taken part in a weekly class in English for native speakers.\n\nMy children are six, nine, and ten years old. The odd choice of words and sometimes grammar does fade with age, but the accent tends to stay unless the children spend some time in a country where English is the main language. At least in the cases that I have seen, a year or two seems to be enough to correct the accent. For example, a friend of my husband has two adult children. One of them lived in the States for a couple of years while the other one only visited every once in a while. The one who lived there (as a teenager if I remember correctly) has an American accent, while the one that didn't has a Finnish accent when they speak English. If you listen to some audio samples of Swedes or Swedish-speaking Finns speaking English, you should get an idea about what it sounds like.\n\nWe try to go to the US once per year or once every second year for a week or two, but also hope to be able to arrange it so that the children can live there at least for some time in the future as well. Right now it has not been possible for us to go there due to the pandemic (actually I think that the restrictions don't apply to us so we could in theory go there, but choose not to), but whenever it is safe to travel again, we'll go back there for a few weeks.\n\nI don't live in Sweden and am not Swedish, but I'd assume that the situation is somewhat similar to here in Finland when it comes to racism: There is some racism from some people, but it's often not so blatant. People of Asian heritage, especially Chinese, are treated a lot better than people of other ethnicities. Americans are generally viewed positively, so as Chinese-Americans I doubt that you would experience much racism, but there are of course awful people everywhere.\n\nThe reason for why we chose German in stead of Spanish was mostly by chance. We wanted to strengthen our oldest daughter's Finnish and found a German-Finnish immersion after school program nearby her school. When her Finnish started improving, we realized that she had also started picking up some German and since there was no similar program for Spanish, we kept having them learn German. Spanish is a very important heritage language for them though because their grandfather speaks Spanish and they really like spending time with him.\n\nI'll edit this post and respond to the rest of the questions later.\n\nEdited to add nothing, because I think I answered all of your questions already. :)", "created_utc": "1616343264.0", "edited": "1616346420.0", "id": "grpojql", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m9fbjc", "parent_id": "t1_grouzp1", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "What their strongest language is has fluctuated a bit throughout the years and our approach has changed accordingly.

At least in my experience with my own children, there is really no app or video that can replace reading out loud to an adult and getting instant feedback. \n\nThe good news is that because your child already knows how to read in another language with the same alphabet, the time required to learn how to read in the next language is considerably shortened. Even five minutes every day goes a long way at this age and stage (or two minutes three times per day), even if that means reading the same one sentence in an easy children's book over and over throughout the day until the child is ready to move on to the next sentence. Apps and videos can help a bit with learning some basic reading skills, but even five minutes per day of reading out loud to a parent is way more effective and you shouldn't have to keep it up for too long until the child can start reading independently.\n\nYour child is still very young though, so he may not be ready to start reading in another language yet and may need to strengthen his English reading skills some more first. In some countries, children are not expected to start to read in any language until the age of seven. Finland is an example of a country that is often considered to have one if the best education systems in the world, and yet, children start learning to read when they are seven (they learn the alphabet when they are six and many do learn some basic reading then as well, but it is not required). The children have plenty of time to catch up when they have matured a bit and are more ready to learn to read. It's ok to take a break and try again in a couple of months or so if things aren't working for you right now.\n\nEven though a tutor is not an option for you right now, I'll share an example from my life that illustrates how a small amount of tutoring can go a long way. My daughters take online German lessons with a tutor we found on italki.com. After only around six half hour lessons, my eight year old started picking up books in German and reading them independently. Not perfectly, of course, but with enough fluency and comprehension for it to be enjoyable for her and for her to want to keep reading (she of course had had previous exposure to the language and understood quite a lot of spoken German, but had not been reading before). Sometimes, it just takes a few lessons for the child to have a breakthrough so you don't necessarily need to keep paying for expensive lessons.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": "1615579131.0", "edited": "1615579340.0", "id": "gqq5edy", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_m3dhev", "parent_id": "t3_m3dhev", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "Hello, u/carlos96vz, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.

If it's possible, joining a German playgroup would be great and also choosing a German-speaking babysitter if possible. \n\nWhen your child gets a bit older, you can introduce some German TV, maybe even have German be the only media language, while continuing with the audiobooks and music. If you can find an immersion program, that would be great, but if not, you can also start adding some online tutoring whenever your child is ready for it (depends on the personality of the child, around age 6-9 would likely be a successful starting time). If possible, you can also travel to German-speaking countries as often as possible.

Overuse of curse words such as f*ck is also a problem, probably because media gives a slightly exaggerated impression of how often and in which situations it it used. That's how you end up with advanced but impolite English speakers who curse a lot. I've definitely been guilty of that too, except maybe the cursing.", "created_utc": "1611984150.0", "edited": "False", "id": "glc7m7t", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l86r3e", "parent_id": "t1_glbkcal", "score": "2", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "This was a really interesting post! Point four is definitely something that I need to improve on. It's been ages since I last called someone fastidious. =) I like it that you linked to other redditors that have written about the topics as well. I found a couple that I didn't recognize and now I have some interesting reading to do.\n\nRegarding point 8 again. I think this is very important to realize. I am not great at grammar. Sure, I have studied all of the grammar points, but I am not great to remembering and applying the rules. I sometimes even mess up basic greetings and the types of material you go through at an A1 level. But what I do mess up does not significantly affect what I can do with the languages. At this point, it doesn't matter if I watch a Netflix show in Swedish, English, Finnish, German, or Spanish. The comprehension rate is about the same. I can read books and newspapers and immigration information and job descriptions and pretty much everything I need to be able to read in those languages (to a lesser extent in Spanish). I can have conversations and write also about more complicated topics and made myself understood and understand others (again to a lesser extent in Spanish). Not perfectly and certainly not with perfect grammar and definitely not always in a way that sound natural and like a native speaker would say it. It's because I can use the languages for all those purposes that I test at an advanced level, not because I have perfected all the grammar, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions that can be found in material for language learners.", "created_utc": "1611927141.0", "edited": "False", "id": "gl8dx5v", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_l6o537", "parent_id": "t3_l6o537", "score": "3", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc"}, {"author": "BlueDolphinFairy", "body": "Hello, u/achanak_bhayanak_, and thank you for posting on r/languagelearning.
