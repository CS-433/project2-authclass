Sorry about the late reply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Strangers**  \nNormally, in public and around strangers, I'm pretty reserved. I don't like to initiate things, even if I want to, and it can lead me to be torn between saying something or not, ultimately resulting in no action done. In places of public service, I make an effort to be earnest, thank the people working, and obviously appear gracious. If I do something that inconveniences someone even the slightest, I'll apologise (people tell me it's an unhealthy habit, but it comes at no personal cost, so I see no problem with it).\n2. **Acquaintances**  \nI get pretty dry. If we're solely acquaintances, I don't really want to make an effort to talk, because I know it's fruitless. If I do, it'll be very shallow, about the weather or very minor things. I don't enjoy gossiping or talking about events going on outside of the setting we're in. I'm not really in tune with humour and I've been told I'm a bit too skeptical/serious.\n3. **Friendly Acquaintances**  \nI separated this as a result of being in school. I've got quite a few friends who I'm more than just an \"acquaintance\" with as a result of occasionally sharing personal info. Around these people, I tend to act a bit more loose, more in the moment, and sometimes I find myself being (too much in my opinion, but probably not enough in others') charismatic and comedic. \n4. **Good Friends**  \nThis is where things get tricky. Depending on the individual, I'll let my guard down a bit more or less. These conversations are usually more honest and frank. I don't feel the need to apologise for nearly as many things. With this people, I'm visibly tired and honest about my feelings or current emotions, as well as current events, worries, and future plans. I'll also discuss my hobbies, goals, and personal things, but that usually comes alongside a stronger friendship level.\n5. **Crushes**  \nThe thing about this one is that I tend to only fall for really close friends. I don't know what it is, but I can only picture myself loving someone I've already been with for a long time. I only pursue dating for commitment, because other than that, I see no point to it. I'm a hugely independent individual, and sacrificing my personal schedule, orientation, and thoughts for the needs of my partner is a huge decision that I need to be certain about making. That being said, if there is a person I've got butterflies for, I tend to become more observant (of them) when near them while simultaneously avoiding eye contact and things that might show I'm interested. This is largely because of two reasons, them being:  \n   1. Homosexuality is extremely unconventional here and would be dangerous to openly pursue, as well as  \n   2. I need to fully know whether or not to go for it, and a large part of that comes from predisposed knowledge of them and their behaviours. Once I decide whether to or not, I'll slowly start getting physically closer in hopes I can force myself to try to speak to them.\n\nRemember, these are just my personal behaviours. Don't apply them to your friend.

You could be experiencing an influx in Se (and therefore the desire to be out and about in your environment / stimulate you wants of intimacy). \n\nHowever, cognitive functions aside, I think loneliness is something that all solo movers go through. An intimacy means comfort, and after moving someplace that isn\u2019t yet home, we want comfort. This could be good and/or bad!

I say this because I notice the use of Ne fluctuates between the two, whereas Si stays the same\u2014the subconscious Si stays the same since it\u2019s natural, but you are probably overthinking the Ne-oriented questions.\n\nHowever. You could very well be an INFJ due to the dominance in Ni and Ti. Unhealthy or younger INFJs can be Ni-Ti oriented, with underdeveloped Fe (or they can be the opposite, with overdeveloped Fe). And it id not unusual for INFJs to score strikingly low on Se. \n\nI would not consider INTJ as an option because your Te is the lowest of all. I would not consider any of the xSxx types a match for you either. ENTJ is a no (by lack of Te), and xNTP seems unlikely. ENFx is also a no (lack of strong Ne/Fe). The trouble here is that you could be an INFJ, INFP, or INTP.\n\nAgain, you are still in development, and having messy cognitive functions is rather normal. Don\u2019t be discouraged by this. Research what each individual function means, and what it values, how it thinks (as opposed to how it acts: don\u2019t focus on the behavioural aspect). Ultimately, you are the best test for yourself. But you can only test accurately when you have accurate information. Research is necessary.\n\nLet us know when you can follow up!

Also, note that both Ni and Ne users value relations quite differently (in a scale of contemplation, not by love: anyone can love) than some Sx types do.

Again, it would be best to research this stuff on your own, but some guiding points never hurt to get you started. It can be dangerous to research without any previous knowledge (tabula rasa: blank slate theory). \n\nFor the ISxJs, their leading, dominant function is Si. Si (Introverted Sensation) is the understanding of information through past events and their outcomes. Si learns best through experience, developing their own sense of understanding simply through observation. With Si (but more so Se), what you see IS what you get. Often concepts or objects can be seen by Si as symbolic, but only because of a specific attached memory or reason. For this reason, Si is very observant and detail-oriented. Si is great at consulting the past, (can be good at) storing memory, and understanding the past through the five senses. Another strength of Si is the capability of naturally understanding and agreeing with the importance of tradition, especially those of personal value. Si is typically connotated with \u201cduty\u201d: something MUST be done, it has always been done this way, etc. Stability and structure are very valuable to Si-users, as they can reach the best conclusions through routine observation. As Si deals with the five senses, and it is the introverted Sensation, it is thought to be linked with receiving sensations rather than instigating them in others, although this might be feeding into a stereotype. \n\nFor the ISFJ: structure, respect, tradition, harmony, and positivity are valuable assets. It deals with Si-dom and Fe-secondary. ISFJs are stereotypically regarded as innocent, pure, friendly, caring, and just generally nice people. Si needs processing time like Ni, but not in the same way. Si finds refuge in becoming an individual of personal qualities found through previous experience. \n\nFor the ISTJ: structure, respect, tradition, efficiency, and proficiency are valuable assets. With Si-dom and Te (Extroverted Thinking), the ISTJ can become a very goal-oriented, efficient person. Te is the logic function of productivity, and focuses on efficiency, sufficiency, proficiency, and capsizing. While Ti needs logic to be thorough in order to comprehend, Te can latch onto systems/structures of information rather quickly (by comparison). The ISTJ can focus on maximising results more than the ISFJ can, because the Te of ISTJ levels the Si, whereas the Ti further contributes to the detail-orientation of ISFJs. ISTJs can be quick learners if their past experiences are beneficial. However, Si can be very tricky in trying to progress. It can be very stubborn and \u201cstuck in its ways.\u201d\n\nWhat else are you looking for?", "created_utc": "1632278317.0", "edited": "False", "id": "hdsrx65", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_psunsv", "parent_id": "t1_hdsotzq", "score": "2", "subreddit": "infj", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r39a"}, {"author": "hotelDenouement", "body": "There are no course without golfers.\n\nThe actual act of golfing doesn\u2019t hurt the environment much.

All of the Ni-users enjoy self-reflection (ENFJ, INFJ, ENTJ, INTJ). Types with high Fi functions also enjoy self reflection, but it is utilised entirely different: Fi (Introverted Feeling) is the function of maintaining harmony with personal authenticity, beliefs, and values. In its healthy form, it is very empathetic (through placing someone else\u2019s shoes on their own), truthful, and content with itself. In an unhealthy form, it can be obsessive, selfish (in the traditional sense) and prideful.

If you aren\u2019t familiar with cognitive functions, basically, every type has a coordinating stack of functions that interact with each other and form lines of thought, and, usually, coordinating behaviours. For the INxJ types, Ni (introverted iNtuition) is the observation function that repeatedly processes information in order to make sense of it. This function is arguably the most introverted function, as it needs ALONE time to process the information it takes in. It seeks out why something is, and why there is a why. \n\nThe second most important function in the INFJ stack is Fe (extroverted Feeling), the people-uniting function. It strives to maintain harmony between people, avoid conflict, and it has its own moral compass handcrafted by objectivity rather than personal opinions. Moreover, the third most important is Ti (introverted Thinking), and this is the logical understanding function. It seeks to understand how something works. \n\nCombine Ni, Fe, and Ti, and voil\u00e0, you have someone who dwells on their anger but won\u2019t speak of it. I personally see no point in venting publicly, as it can really diminish healthy, interpersonal atmospheres. I much prefer to internally analyse than air my grievances.
