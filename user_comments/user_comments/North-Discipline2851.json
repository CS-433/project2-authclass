I\u2019m not an expert and this is the first time I\u2019ve put in serious work into language learning, but it\u2019s been going good.\n\nI started with Russian first. Some would suggest Spanish first, because it\u2019s easier for a native English speaker to pick up. I say start with the harder one.\n\nAfter a couple months of Russian I could speak simple sentences and ask basic questions. I learned the six main cases and got a good amount of vocabulary down.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve spoken a bit of Spanish before, but I lost all of it. But oh my gosh! After months of difficult Russian, learning Spanish feels like a treat. It\u2019s easier to pick up the grammar rules and conjugations. I\u2019m already working on speaking even though I\u2019ve haven\u2019t been studying that long, I believe once I beef up my Spanish vocab I can start having actual conversations.\n\nCool thing about it is that there\u2019s enough similarities that learning both languages compliments each other (I\u2019ve had an easier time with t\u00fa/usted + conjugations because of my exposure to \u0442\u044b/\u0432\u044b.) But they\u2019re different enough that unless I\u2019m really tired, I don\u2019t get them mixed up.\n\nOne problem I have noticed! I know/am friends with several Spanish speakers, so while I was more confident in my Russian prior to this, now I\u2019m excelling in Spanish and feel this is more comfortable for me. Since Russian is harder, I feel some of my enthusiasm and motivation now leaning towards Spanish, which is something I didn\u2019t want to happen.\n\nBut I\u2019m really excited someone else is doing the same thing I am!\n\n* Flashcards in Russian/Spanish with no English have helped me in both classes.\n\n* I\u2019ll try to spend an entire day on one language, and then the next on the other.

As far as me liking one more than the other, they definitely feel like different shows to me.

Not everyone can understand how amazing it is seeing POC playing the leads on a show. For me, every episode was incredible (of S1).\n\nThis goes doubly for the inclusion of Mel - lesbian middle child who doesn\u2019t have the whole coming out arc, but treated like her heterosexual counterparts when it comes to her romance. (S1) Mel relationships were a breath of fresh air for this Puerto Rican/black queer middle child.\n\nThe storylines of S1 were compelling. Playing tribute to the OG Charmed (youngest sister witch falling for a demon) while moving in newer directions (middle sister dating a witch from another coven). The purging of the elders was insane. The visuals of course are really good, being a new show.\n\nI loved them experimenting and learning new magic. Their joy of learning the magic gave me joy! I liked how the handled the newer storylines (Medusa\u2019s sympathetic story was awesome, in my opinion. Macy\u2019s application of science to magic?! So cool!!)\n\nIf they kept the storylines and drive they *started* in S1, I could probably confidently say I enjoy the new Charmed more than the OG. But unfortunately, S1 was a small taste of what could\u2019ve been. They started strong, but they were only *just* getting themselves established.\n\nAnd (in my opinion) they trashed that potential in S2, and lit it in S3 to create a huge dumpster fire. (Plus mirroring my favorite sister leaving is a parallel I could\u2019ve done without.)\n\nThey had the potential to do amazing things!

Yeah, I got treated like trash for being obviously different. Ironically I was more feminine in the closet than I\u2019ve ever been out of it, so everyone basically knew.

When gay porn was discovered on the computer, they never brought that up, however. Pretend like it didn\u2019t happen, and the issue goes away, I guess?\n\nTwo things that helped me keep my faith:\n\n1. I\u2019d never allow a human to tell me what God does or doesn\u2019t feel, or dictate to me what\u2019s wrong or right. God hasn\u2019t judged me yet, and he\u2019s the only one that can. I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t look at the Bible with a rational, scientific, historical mindset. It\u2019s supposed to be real accounts of history, but Christians often forget that. They\u2019re so caught up in their bigoted, hateful views that they\u2019d treat everyone (their own children) like shit when it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Cherry picking verses that back their hate (not understanding said verses) and forgetting the rest.\n\nHate the sin, love the sinner?

As a child it was a simple to me as being born straight. Even when I was told it was sinful and wrong, even before I knew there was a word for it, I honestly couldn\u2019t understand why/how it was so bad. (Still can\u2019t.) I stayed in the closet because my father would have kicked me out of the house if I acted on my homosexuality - the only thing I had to accept about myself is that it was going to be a hard life for me.     \n\nI was born African American with a Latino last name and Native American ancestors. I accepted my life would be difficult from a young age, so I guess whether it was how dark my skin is, the God I pray to, or the person I went to bed with, someone is going to hate me over something.\n\nI either had to live with all of these worries and guilt for things I couldn\u2019t change; or live for *ME* and find my own happiness! So I am proud of my skin, I love Jesus, and I\u2019ve been going to sleep every night next to the same man for the past 7 1/2 years.\n\nAnd I may not be the best damn Christian out there, but I am living my best damn life - and I don\u2019t give a damn who hates me for it.

The fluffy sweet, \u201clook mama, we\u2019re sUpErHeRoEs!\u201d, *overplayed* villains, the will they, won\u2019t they that drags out for FOUR seasons, putting more focus on uninteresting characters (I\u2019m looking at you, Landon), underdeveloped characters (Wade. Raf. Hell, even Hope herself - in this show, she exists to be Landon\u2019s girlfriend!), the show not taking itself seriously (y\u2019all talk about the Star Wars episode all day long, but that Christmas episode *stained* my soul.)\n\nEven being a teen series, set in high school, TVD was always dark, violent, and completely unpredictable. People were killed off left and right, but damn did it keep that show interesting. In this series it\u2019s like they\u2019re *afraid* to kill off anybody!!! (Alyssa should\u2019ve stayed dead. Raf should\u2019ve been killed off, I love him, but it would\u2019ve been better than his \u201chappy ending\u201d. Jed should\u2019ve been killed off - werewolves are supposedly so cutthroat, and he\u2019s not only very weak but he\u2019s also an idiot, and we don\u2019t need ANYMORE comedic relief.)\n\nTVD and TO always had a new big bad - or multiple! - every season. Even when they failed (I\u2019m looking at you, Sirens) there was still something fresh brought to the series. Monster-of-the-week is played out and lazy writing. Malivore is *finally* interesting, but after 4 seasons I\u2019m feed up with him. And no, while The Necromancer was more comedic relief, he was no Kai, who you couldn\u2019t help but love and hate at the same time, or Silas, who (although fell flat) still was a dreaded villain.\n\nCharacter development? What\u2019s that! Anything interesting is forgotten by the next episode. Kaleb got a backstory, finally, AFTER 4 seasons?! The only character who\u2019s grown is Lizzie! Everyone else is doing the same shit. No one has grown or learned from their mistakes. Hope is *trying* but it\u2019s been 4 seasons and she\u2019s still knocking people out if they disagree with her. \n\nThe couples suck. I enjoyed Finch, but I honestly didn\u2019t care when her and Josie broke up. If it had been a TVD couple, I probably would\u2019ve cared. Hope and Landon have never felt like an \u201cepic love\u201d, but instead of *actually* being epic, they\u2019re just called epic. MG and Lizzie? I\u2019m over them, but Ethan is so boring. \n\nKaleb isn\u2019t in love with Cleo, he\u2019s obsessed with her, but that somehow means he cares, I guess? It\u2019s so underdeveloped it comes off as weird to me. Alaric and Emma were starting a weird love triangle, and then her and Doran (one of my favorites) were basically written off the show. Alaric dates the cop (which was awkward and forced) but then she randomly disappears forever (and leaves her teenage son behind, cause\u2026 *reasons*)\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have taken 4 seasons to finally start being good. But honestly if they drag this Malivore shit into season 5 I\u2019m done.
