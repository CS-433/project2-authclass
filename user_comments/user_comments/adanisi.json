We have got that. Other than that, \u201chistory\u201d is too broad to accurately address.\n\n- Trading relationships; If we rejoin the EU or the EEA or anything to trade with the EU, we have that sorted. England also won\u2019t give up wanting our, say, electricity, so they\u2019ll probably buy it from us even post-indy (they still do from the EU).\n\n- Natural resources; Oil, etc, is being phased out globally if that\u2019s what you mean, but regardless we have plenty of oil here. If you mean things like wind, also got plenty of that here.\n\n- Established industries; Plenty, Fishing, Food & Drink, Forestry, Oil & Gas, Renewable Energy, Textiles, Tourism (exact list from Wikipedia).\n\n- Centres of excellence; Please elaborate? I\u2019m not sure I understand this, but I\u2019m going to guess it refers to education. Scotland has a world-renowned education system and a highly educated population. The education system is a bit dated but appears to be reforming slowly now, so that\u2019ll probably change soon.\n\n- Skills; Highly educated population, see above.\n\n- Climate; Like weather, or social/political climate? I don\u2019t know what this is supposed to mean.\n\n- Proximity to other markets; We are in the north-west of Europe. Geographical proximity with the EU is a non-issue (as demonstrated by the UK before, and Ireland still). And if England was open to trading, that\u2019s even less of an issue since we share a land border.\n\n- Language; The main language spoken in Scotland is English, the lingua franca of the world, communication with other countries is a non issue. If you are referring to having native languages, the Scottish government has been making efforts to stop Scots and G\u00e0idhlig from dying out.\n\n- Population density; Scotland is not very population dense overall. Plenty of space for forests, farms, wildlife, etc. (So good for agriculture and the environment).\n\n- Political stability; Scotland is a damn sight more stable than the UK at the moment. It is relatively stable politically I\u2019d say.\n\n- Cultural work-ethic; This may need tackling, as from my knowledge there are many people being paid low wages in the UK (and thus Scotland). If higher average wages are paid, work ethic would likely improve dramatically (more incentive to work).", "created_utc": "1655497467.0", "edited": "False", "id": "icr7tgs", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_velm0j", "parent_id": "t1_icr418d", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Scotland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkli"}, {"author": "adanisi", "body": "Yeah, this paper is.
