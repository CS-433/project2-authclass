The reason people should be coming to your stream is because they like you and the game. That's sustainable growth. If people are coming to your stream just for the drops, that's not sustainable because what happens when drops change? You'll see a decline in your viewership and there's literally nothing you can do about it. It's almost as bad as bots when it comes to your viewership numbers. I understand that a little bit of drops can help but when it's this never ending campaign there's no incentive to interact with the streamer, which is why you stream in the first place.  \n\nIt's painfully evident, I'll give you an example from this morning. Our lord and savoir y0ttabyte was streaming in his usual time slot. IIRC y0tta brings in around 500 viewers on any given day, most likely more. Another smaller streamer (whom I very much enjoy as a person and a streamer) MustacheMagicMan decided to run a diamond campaign. There's nothing wrong with running a diamond campaign that's what they're there for. However when I logged onto twitch this morning it surprised me to see that MM was at the top of my \"followed\" list at 550 viewers and y0tta below him hovering in the mid 200's. MM's usual viewer count for that time is somewhere between 20-50 viewers, so obviously our twitch community is drawn to the drops. The last time I remember seeing y0tta that low at the time slot he absolutely dominates was pre drops. I've been a part of this twitch community for a long time, I remember when our top streamers were barely cracking 100 viewers.

It's been almost two years for me in this community and to see it's evolution has been awesome. However we're at a crossroads right now and you've pointed it out. Who is this game for? You can either push the hardcore or casual crowd and right now DWD is treading water in an odd middle ground. To promote a 100k tournament but still coddle the playerbase is an interesting decision. From what most of us gather, Scarlatch is the end all be all of this game. I have a feeling that what we're seeing balance wise is Scarlatch's reactions to negative critisim. Look I don't know the guy personally, and I have immense respect for the work that he's done in building a company and a game, but I think that we need a bit of a mutiny. I mean that in the most polite way as possible, and of course I could be completely off base with this. I think it's time someone from the dev team put on their big boy pants and have a come to Jesus meeting.  \n\nI've supported this game with money, supported it's streamers, and even made content.

I'm enjoying the contributions you are giving to the community, between streaming, YouTube and this post.   \n\n1. I'm in the minority here, Teacher hasn't ruined many, if any games for me. I usually have an answer or I'm playing a deck that does not care about the extra cards. However I understand and could see the change to +2  \n\n2. Icaria is a card I've been thinking about a lot these past couple of weeks. I personally do not like her because all the decks I play don't have great answers. The majority of my time I'm playing Workshop Forge, which I just lose turn 7 due to a lack of interaction. Various other decks I play just don't play well with her, beside Feln Control. So I'd also like to see a rotation at some point, maybe we have something coming with set 5.   \n\n3. I have no problem with Rally at all. I get it, it sucks losing to \"degenerate play\" but I don't really believe you can play the game wrong. If you want to just smash face all day go for it, I personally get bored of it. However if you need to crank out some wins real quick it's great for that.  \n\nI'm honestly not sure what I'd change about this game beside Icaria at this point. That's mainly for a selfish reason of me wanting to play different decks and not auto losing turns 5-7.

This deck can win, especially if Aggro lets you stabilize. You get in to trouble when you have lack luster draws, i.e. nothing to do on turns 1-3.

I've found I now appreciate his subtle yet interesting links. At first glance this combo looks pretty normal, but I think you'll find that there's some gems hidden in that shroud of simplicity. There's also the fact that when he executes certain tricks he has a nonchalance that I aim for in my spinning. When you're looking at a spinner and something catches your eye, even if it's just the way the execute something you can steal that. \n\n**Total Breakdown**\n\nFL TA Reverse TF-TF ~> Shadow Reverse TF-12 -> Shadow 12-12 ~> Sonic Clip T2 -> \nSpider Spin 12-12 -> Pass 12-23 -> Twisted Sonic 23-12 -> Neo Sonic 12-T1 ->\nFinger Switch T1-T2 ->  Tipped Sonic T2-12 -> Twisted Sonic Reverse 12-23 ->\nTwisted Sonic 23-12 ~> Shadow 12-23 -> Inverse Sonic 23-12 -> Inverse Twisted Sonic 12-23 ->\nTwisted Sonic Reverse 23-34 -> Pass 34-23 -> Twisted Sonic 23-12 -> Pass Reverse 12-T1 -> \nTipped Charge T1 -> Fingerswitch T1-T2 -> Tipped Charge T2 -> Finger Switch T2-T3 -> \nTipped Charge T3 -> Wiper Reverse T3-TF -> TF Charge Reverse -> FL TA Reverse TF-12 ->\nBak 12-12 ~> FL TA Reverse 23 -> Pass Reverse 23-12 -> Extended TA 12-12 ~> Scissor Spin 12-T1 ->\nFL TA  \n\nOkay there's a lot going on with this one so I'll highlight once again what I think is awesome. \n\n**The opening sequence:**  \nFL TA Reverse TF-TF ~> Shadow Reverse TF-12 -> Shadow 12-12 ~> Sonic Clip T2 -> \nSpider Spin 12-12 -> Pass 12-23 \n\nI'm not sure I got the notation on this one correct but that's not a huge deal. I think the way that Saizen executes here is what initially drew me to this combo. The way he throws the pen is a great stylistic addition. Anyways the link I'm most interested in here is the Shadow 12-12 ~> Sonic Clip T2 this is something you'd  probably miss if you didn't slow the combo down. He fakes you out thinking that he's going to do the classic Shadow 12-12 ~> FL TA Reverse bit, but that sonic clip changes everything. This is almost a Fingerswitch, but I think that because the Shadow is already in a top spin mode it's just Sonic Clip. The to throw the whole Spider Spin in there so subtly is really interesting. Keep in mind that this combo is from 2008, now we think of Spider Spins as power tricks and mainstays of combos. To me, if you're able to link a Spider Spin into a combo in 2008 you'd make a more grand gesture like this combo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnUC5IuYH6s . Instead we have Saizen just throwing it in like \"Yeah I can do this all day.\" .  \n\n**Wiper sequence:**\n\n Twisted Sonic 23-12 -> Pass Reverse 12-T1 -> \nTipped Charge T1 -> Fingerswitch T1-T2 -> Tipped Charge T2 -> Finger Switch T2-T3 -> \nTipped Charge T3 -> Wiper Reverse T3-TF\n\nI'd like to point out first that this is not how you should end a wiper sequence. TF Charge Reverse is the death of all combos IMHO, it's probably the most stable mini combo in the history of penspinning and seems lazy to me after doing a difficult mini combo. With that being said I still think this is a great mini combo. The whole Tipped Charge fall is executed well enough that it doesn't seem like a ton of filler even though it's not that difficult. The way Saizen transitions into the wipers is again going with his subtle style.\n\nOverall I don't think this combo is that difficult and it has some great points. There is some pretty weak filler between mini combos but I'm not so concerned with the actual tricks. I think the main thing to take away from this combo is the style and execution, while there are some lazy links it is still a visually appealing combo.

The reason why i.suk, Menowa, and Peem took years to develop like that is because they were/are pioneers. If you look at what we had back then there's no wonder it took this much time.

I could do the charge with a drumstick way before I could do it with a pen. In fact I can think of many tricks that I used a heavier mod to learn and then brought it back to my lighter mods. A couple examples from my personal spinning: Inverse Sonic, Inverse Shadow, Inverse Neobak, Twisted Sonic Multiple Bust, BakFall, Midbak 1.5's, Spider Spin, Multiple Thumbaround, Passaround, Around 1.5's. The list goes on, I'd argue it's way easier to learn tricks with a heavier mod. As far as going from Light to Heavy, yes it is easier to transition once you have the muscle memory down, but that's not saying you can't learn something with a heavy pen first. That does not hinder your spinning, it may hinder what mods you can use initially but that can be fixed. Furthermore, spinning a heavier mod speeds up your learning process.  \n\nAs far as general advice I would say yes, when someone is just starting out, grab a pencil and learn your fundamentals. I'm not arguing what someone should do when they are first starting out. I'm more focused on this idea that once someone has started to spin more seriously that there's a progression they need to take. There's some weird idea that it takes years and years to learn some of these tricks and it's just not true. I think that TheAker, Flash and Reaper are more than enough evidence for this.  \n\nMy alternative, while I'm still questioning it myself, would be to teach people how to have goals. We can't help them until they help themselves. So if a spinner is 3 months in and they post a video of Supawit doing something ridiculous then we have something to go off of. People who just ask \"what's next?\" or \"What mod do I spin\" are the people we should be going after and asking, \"What do you want your spinning to look like?\". That's the only way we'd help people. So instead of saying, \"Oh you're at 3 months there's no way you could do this power combo.\". Just give them a hint and say, \"Well you're going to need to do X.\" And then let them decide. We can't force anyone to spin, obviously, but we can definitely point them in the right direction.  \n\nI think if we taught people to start thinking about their spinning critically then it would nurture spinners better. \n\n", "created_utc": "1493500980.0", "edited": "False", "id": "dgx836i", "is_submitter": "True", "link_id": "t3_68amiw", "parent_id": "t1_dgx6ex6", "score": "14", "subreddit": "penspinning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryre"}, {"author": "PrimeTemps", "body": "Well you're going to need a heavy pen.

What about all the energy that it takes to move manure from those animals' cages?

If you raise a cow in the pasture there's no need for that corn to be trucked, if you don't feed them corn you don't need to use antibiotics. \n\nI'd argue that yes you get more meat per square acre but that's because you're not accounting for all the extra energy involved.
