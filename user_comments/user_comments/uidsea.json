Casual to hardcore works. Tab target or action combat.\n\nPreferred Mechanics:\n\nJust the dots. I want to watch numbers tick their health down. I guess any semi-afk classes work as I'm usually watching stuff while grinding. Pet classes could satisfy this but I did an earlier post about pet classes and got no fun classes aside maybe the Mastermind from CoH which I'm playing.\n\nExclusions?: No open-world pvp.
