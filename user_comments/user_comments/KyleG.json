Average Joe is like \"what the fuck is that, sounds stupid, if you don't have anything to hide...\" but it's the backbone of our entire commercial world. Blockchain technology solves a lot of problems, and NFTs are just one application of it.\n\n**Edit** Consider this: you're an author who wants to sell your content, but you don't want the person you share it with to claim it as their own. Before sharing the content, you has the content of your document to produce a unique token. You embed it in an NFT. Bam, now there's a publicly-available, publicly-owned record that *you* are the original owner of that hash, which uniquely identifies the content. Then you share it. The person tries to rip you off by claiming they created it, sells it to make a movie, whatever. In the meantime, your house is hit by lightning/you have a fire/flood/are robbed, and your computer you created the work on is stolen.\n\nBefore blockchain, there's a lengthy legal battle where you struggle to prove *you* have the creation history of the work, not the other person. You spend insane amounts of money on lawyers to fight it, and you probably can't afford it and give up and shout into the void the rest of your life \"that was my novel!\"\n\nAfter blockchain, you go \"no look at this\" and there's no legal battle at all. Argument irrefutably settled.\n\nNow imagine every inventor uses this to prove they invented something before a big company steals it. Every person who ever signs a contract can verify with 100% accuracy the content of the contract they signed (to prove altered documents were altered by the other entity), to prove a history of item sales, in a long chain of shipments of commercial goods you'll be able to verify when other entities received/released the items, etc.\n\nSure you can put the data on, say, Google Drive. But I hope it's not Google you go up against arguing over who invented something! \\*accidentally deletes the other guy's files from our servers\\*\n\n**Edit 2** FWIW the old way I was taught in copyright class for how someone might prove original authorship of content would be to produce the hash and then pay The New York Times (or another newspaper that gets microfiched and put in libraries) to put that hash with your name in the classifieds.\n\nThen if you need to prove ownership, you pull whatever NYT issue has your classified ad you paid for.

Not savings in a bank or retirement accounts or anything.\n\nHere is the typical American lifespan:\n\n1. grow up until ready to buy a house (usually married, no kids or possibly planning to start soon)\n2. buy \"starter home\" that is affordable for people in their 20s\n3. use for a few years, get better job, have more savings, possibly plan for more kids or to start having them\n4. sell house, buy new, bigger, more expensive one located near a good school (often more expensive *because* it's near a good school)\n5. spend at minimum two decades in that house, not saving much bc the house was at the outer edge of what you can afford to pay for mortgage-wise, while your kids make use of the good schools in the area\n6. after the two decades, maybe you sell the house or decide to stay there until you retire\n7. retire\n8. now it's just you and your spouse, and you don't need to live near a good school since no kids anymore, so sell house and move to smaller, cheaper one\n9. use the money from the sold house (minus the new one) to fund your retirement since you couldn't save much\n\nNow, if that house has not outpaced inflation, you are *fucked* in your retirement.\n\nIt is true that HOA rules years ago were based on keeping minorities out of white neighborhoods, but that's not the case anymore (at least not where I live, near the Mexican border, where it'd be impossible to have an all-white anything).\n\nHOAs primarily serve to *prevent a home's value from decreasing*. They do this by making sure your neighbors don't let *their* homes get ugly. Because there is research that the appearance of your neighbors' homes dramatically affect your home's value in the marketplace.\n\nThat's why the rules exist. To keep the neighborhood looking pretty, so when you sell your home, you can actually afford to retire.\n\n-------\n\n**Edit** For a little example, take me and my wife: we got married and lived in an apartment. We wanted to start gardening for real, so we bought a house at 28yo or so. Three bedroom (ours, an office, and a guest room for visitors) with a big backyard that I grew vegetables and stuff in, plus we BBQed on a deck I built and had family over for holidays. The house was **$112,000**. My wife and I made about that much a year in household income.\n\nFast forward approx. ten years. HHI significantly more, with one kid and another on the way. We bought a house worth about seven times as much so we could do *major* landscaping/gardening, have some amenities not available in my city (primarily a clay tennis court), have goats and chickens, etc. Fifteen minute drive from my kids' amazing school now that they're old enough to go to school.\n\nThere's absolutely no way we sell this house while our kids are in school. Probably never, but if we were struggling financially, at this point the house has already appreciated about $200K since we bought it three years ago. If we were to sell this and move back into the previous house (which we still own but rent out), we'd unlock I guess about half a million dollars to live on until we die.\n\nI admit our actual financials aren't average *at all*, but the same pattern of home buying is there.

So the title was the only thing remaining.\n\n**Edit** Actually macrimo missed a bit of the translation. The introduction she makes in the last panel, the kanji for her name is the same, but her last name kanji have furigana indicating it's pronounced Komyu instead of Komi. So she says \"Good morning! I'm Komyu Shouko! Nice to meet you!\" And FWIW she's saying it like you'd say it to a friend. A more casual register. More like Najimi. Remember early on Tadano refuses to call her by her first name but keeps calling her by her last name? *The opposite* of that level of formality lol.\n\n**Edit 2** So you might actually indicate the level of formality she's using and be a little looser with the translation: \"Yoooooo! I'm Komyu Shouko! Nice to meet you!\" damn it's actually kind of hard to make that less formal in English without resorting to regional accents, which even then doesn't really work.\n\n**Edit 3** 12 hours later: \"Yoooooo\" <-- there I go again, not considering my own gender when translating stuff. \"Heeeeey! I'm Komyu...\" would've been better. Nothing about what she says sounds boyish, but to my ear as a native English speaker, \"yooooooo\" sounds more like bro-speech. I just provided it as a casual greeting because that's how I (as a dude) might achieve the same level of informality.", "created_utc": "1663297471.0", "edited": "1663341663.0", "id": "iomapjb", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xf85yd", "parent_id": "t1_iokzrly", "score": "13", "subreddit": "Komi_san", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ptdy"}, {"author": "KyleG", "body": ">polyglots . . .

The hands predominantly fall in this area about 80 percent of the time when signing. However, the signing infants and children looked primarily at the face, barely looking at the hands.\n\nThe researcher offers some possible explanations, but they have not been investigated yet according to the article.
