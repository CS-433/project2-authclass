Dietitians will generally say to have most of your calories be carbs.  They will also say to eat at least four times a day.

He already speaks multiple languages and teaches Spanish which has some overlap with Arabic.

This is seen in his saying always start with clothes and colors but I wish he would have explained why.  He also was one on one time for most of the hours.   He was highly motivated and made a film about it.   His job is language learning and teaching and he looks to have a lot of experience in it.  \n\nHis total hours was over 800 spent.  2200 hours is the standard for fluency.   Was he fluent?    I have no clue, but he sounds impressive to me.   However, those hour estimates are not designed with this type of scenario in mind.   They are designed for small classes of military or State dept staff who are not usually professional linguists going into the class but they are usually tested for language aptitude.  They are not one on one training.   They are fairly immersive with 6-8 hours a day of schooling.   They do a fair amount of drill and they spend much of the time in the target language.   Like the guy in the video, their job is language learning and they should be very motivated.  \n\nThe average college or worse high school student doesn\u2019t particularly want to take a language but are required to.

It reminds me of flipped classrooms where the teacher has the students learn via videos at home and the help them with checking learning in the classroom.  \n\nThere is no doubt that children learn language via immersion.  How long does it take them to get fluent?   As we get older we know more and can use that knowledge to apply and learn more.   We do that with everything else we learn.  Why would we not use what we already know from English instead of trying to develop it without our current knowledge?   If immersion is the absolute best way with no English, why does Rosetta Stone get such poor reviews?
