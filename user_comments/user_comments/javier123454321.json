However, there are a few things that you can do to help yourself out.\n\nStep 1. Like yourself. If you don't like yourself, and approach someone (this is especially true if there is romantic intent) then it will be weird. Your thoughts words and actions reflect who you are, and if you go up to someone and have nothing interesting to say, all you are thinking about is how bad/ugly or whatever pejorative you are, then it won't be a pleasant interaction. Does that sound like a fun person to be around? It can actually be pretty draining.\n\nSo what if you don't like yourself? Well, change those things about yourself that you don't like. Don't tackle everything at once. If you are fat, don't make your goal to loose 50 pounds, that's overwhelming. Make your goal to not eat sweets, or chips, or whatever that thing is that you know you shouldn't be eating. And don't make it so you can never eat it, just not on a regular everyday basis. Then you can go exercise a little bit. Maybe take the stairs instead of the elevator. At any rate start somewhere. The smaller the goals are, the more achievable they become, and there is so much to be said about incremental improvements. Take care of yourself first. Really though, you should go to the gym, seriously, that will put you in a better place.\n\nYou say you are a loser, and that is one of those things that as soon as you believe it, it becomes true, because loser is a state of mind. What does a a person that is not a loser do in your mind? Not the circumstantial things like, 'have a lot of friends', but the things that are habits. Maybe a cool person drives cars, or skates, or parachutes, or whatever. Do interesting things, and you will have interesting things to talk about with people. You can find interesting things to do that you are passionate about. Find them and DO THEM. You will suck at it at first, everyone does at first, but you have to get started to get anywhere.\n\nSo once you start doing interesting things more and more, more and more you will become an interesting person. And interesting people have things to say. Forget about the girl, and focus on yourself. You don't have to be set by any means, but you are creating your future at every second. You are FREE to chose how it is going to play out, and staying in a rut takes effort, as well as moving forward. Don't let life grab you by the balls, you go out and be intentional about where you are going to end up.

In philosophy, modernism was a movement that is very complex within itself but it does have certain tendencies such as a belief in the linear direction of time and progress, where the solution tends to lie in the future, and tends to be tied to technological innovations. It also posits that there is an Objective Truth, be it God, Mathematics, Science, etc. which can be discovered through reason. A particularly necessary aspect of this Truth, is that it is universal, applicable to everyone everywhere (And perhaps the belief that its application is Good).\n\nPostmodernism is a general tendency to be skeptical of the manner in which this appeal to an Objective Truth has actually been the main instrument to create hierarchal structures of power and oppression. Take the way which God has been used to justify colonialism, or the way which Nazis characterized the superiority of the Aryans as objective fact, and could therefore justify their actions. You could perhaps call postmodernism more of a condition in which the so called Objective Truth has failed to deliver result of bringing happiness or prosperity to the majority of the western world which modernism had promised, and the resulting fallout with all the contrasting theories of what went wrong.\n\nI really like Dungey State University's podcast episode called [Life as Art](http://traffic.libsyn.com/urdsu/Life_as_Art_Final.mp3) which gives a brief historical overview of this process.\n\nNeo-Marxism is all the current explorations and elaborations of the thought of Karl Marx, his dialectical materialism and critique of capitalism, (but I have already butchered an extremely complex phenomena with an inexcusably short and inadecuate explanation, so I won't do that twice in a single comment).\n\nP.S.

What is the meaning of the ever-new appearance of these founders of moralities and religions, of these instigators of fights about moral valuations, these teachers of pangs of conscience and religious wars? What is the meaning of these heroes on this stage? For these have been the heroes thus far; and everything else, even if at times it was all that we could see and was far too near, has always served only to set the stage for these heroes, whether as machinery and backdrop or in the role of confidant and servant. (The poets, for example, were always the servants of some kind of morality.) It is obvious that these tragedies, too, work in the interest of the species, even if they should believe that they are working in the interest of God, as God's emissaries. They, too, promote the life of the species by promoting the faith in life. 'Life is worth living', each of them shouts, 'there is something to life, there is something behind life, beneath it; beware!' This drive, which rules the highest as well as the basest of human beings - the drive for the preservation of the species - erupts from time to time as reason and passion of mind; it is then surrounded by a resplendent retinue of reasons and tries with all its might to make us forget that fundamentally it is drive, instinct, stupidity, lack of reasons.

What he calls the noumenon, or things in themselves outside of how we perceive them, probably has no resemblance to our perception of them and our human capacity is unable to even conceive how that might be because we are bound to a temporo spatial and sensory model which has no basis on reality.

I grew up going to punk and ska shows which are subcultures built on a general notion of angst against our alienating society. The entire scene was always about gathering with like minded people and finding ways to give a creative method of expressing any frustration that you have with whatever shitty situation life might throw at you.   Circle pits as they are called in those settings were not a place to fight one another but a space to dance (skank) whenever you felt like it. Yeah there was a lot of physical contact, pushing, shoving, and slamming,  but it was always built on comradery. It was never an aggression against each other, just an explosion of energy by people who felt moved by the music. The thing is that in those spaces, even if they are 'violent' you always made sure that if someone feel down they got back up, if they wanted to leave they could,  and if they got hurt, they were talking care of by everybody,  very rarely (though it did happen, especially when people that were not familiar with the culture were involved) did people get mad at each other over it. It was very much a plur vibe within these moments of so called aggressive behavior, and it is both exhilarating and almost addicting. \n\nI was in my late teens when i started going to edm shows, and i was always attracted to the heavier side,  especially the reggae and dub influenced stuff. It really reminded me of the places scene i used to frequent, and i felt the acceptance i had become used to at those places. The thing is that the way i knew how to let go musically and dance was very much physical, and people would often glare at me if i accidentally interfered with their personal space,  a completely understandable reaction.  I learned the norms of behavior quickly and tried to be respectful because ravers tend to be nothing but welcoming. But there were those moments where i felt a desire to be so lost in the music among so many people that i would have liked to get lost in dance without worrying about offending others for inflicting on their space, and if moshpits coincided near me, i would join. I always maintained the same norms of comradery and respect that i did during punk/ska shows but the scene is different enough that it's not reciprocated by everybody.  I guess that because it's not so normal or expected in an edm setting, the collective unspoken rules about that type of expression are not  as established as a punk/ska show where it is the norm. I can't attest to many other types of music as I'm not as familiar with other subcultures as i am with those two, but that is my take.

You pose some interesting questions that have actually been in discussion among thinkers for some time now, I would put it around the 60s when the concept of modular interchangeable housing really began to take prominence in the discourse, though architects like LeCorbusier were talking about it at the turn of the century.\n\nThe traditional problem with the assertion that houses should be moveable is that moveable houses do not serve the problem of density very well. Vertical density in particular is a difficult thing to achieve due to the extremely demanding structural requirements of building housing units on top of each other in an efficient way. The way that a building is calculated structurally, in order to be economically efficient, uses the minimum amount of structural support needed (plus a margin of error to allow for extraneous circumstances). Density is a far more efficient way to allocate resources in today's world. The prospect that people could use their own patch of land to host their homes is especially displayed in the planning and construction of suburbia. The effects of that, along with the over reliance on transportation technology has exacerbated the environmental problem by creating a dependance on the automobile and the modification of our urban centers to fit that mindset.\n\nThe second issue is infrastructural support. Like I said, having a moving home is not a particularly new idea, but whenever it is envisioned, it is often implemented as a static object with an aesthetic of of modularity. [The nakagin capsule tower is a perfect example of this.](http://www.archdaily.com/110745/ad-classics-nakagin-capsule-tower-kisho-kurokawa) Buckminster Fuller also designed and built [the dymaxion house](http://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/dymaxion-world/dymaxion-house) whose aim was to be easily transportable, mass produced and producing its own energy. The reception of this particular house has been mixed and not many have been built to actually house people. Energy is probably the easiest part of infrastructure to decentralize at a building level, if all the projects produced more energy than they consumed and fed it back to the grid. Ironically, I only see that working through a centralized ordinance under the current system. Sewage and water catchment and treatment are possible but significantly more difficult to implement along with your car/house hybrid idea. I suppose it would be far more probable to implement if there was a standardized way of doing this. Completely theoretical versions of this were put out by a group of architects called archigram which 'designed' proposals meant to trigger conversation about topics around these issues, like the [plug in city](http://www.archdaily.com/399329/ad-classics-the-plug-in-city-peter-cook-archigram) which I believe does what you are saying, but is what is deemed 'paper architecture' - architectural designs that are never meant to be built. They also designed [inflateable suits that could work as houses](http://architecturewithoutarchitecture.blogspot.com/p/cushicle-and-suitaloon-were-conceptual.html) and [entire walking cities](http://archigramwalkingcity.weebly.com/). You get the point.\n\nToday, the tiny house movement is probably closest to what you are speaking of directly. Though, you should also check out the [wikihouse project](http://www.wikihouse.cc/). Also, along parallel lines, but not necessarily what you describe, the work of John Habraken might interest you, in particular his book about the structure of the ordinary. Also the work of Alejandro Aravena and his half houses, a project which the architect designs and builds half of a house with the infrastructural support to allow for the self construction of the other half when people have the means in the future, a design which he released as open source. All these are testaments to the will of people wrestling with how to tackle the question you pose. There are far more examples, and I realize that none of these are exactly on the dot of what you are asking, but the will is there - at least in some circles of the professional discourse on the design of cities and buildings.

Yes it might use some formal elements used by Zaha but Architecture is much more than an  aesthetic style used on buildings. There is far more nuance to designing a building that it undermines the efforts it would take to pull a design like this one off. \n\nI am personally not a huge fan of this on purely aesthetic terms but this is a skillful execution of an architectural concept. The curves are meant to blend with the landscape, the program is well thought out, and the public spaces that it creates are well executed. I particularly think the execution of the parking is very interesting too which is an often underrated or deliberately underplayed aspect of design. This building does make an attempt at relating to and preserving its surroundings and in my opinion does it with success.\n\nThe examples that the articles point out are literal transpositions of an envelope as an aesthetic choice. That is blatant copying and has no merit in design. On the other hand, Architecture uses the concept of precedent pretty extensively, and being inspired by what has been done is not uncommon, one could argue it is unavoidable. Thus design is about taking previous solutions and adapting it to the problem you are trying to solve in a new way that is never done in isolation. If you want to criticize this building, you could do it in plenty of ways like saying that the relation to the landscape argument is unjustified, that it is another manifestation of iconographic architecture, that the competition process which created it is wasteful, or investigate its effects on the surrounding wetlands or resource consumption in terms of embedded energy in the materials of the building.

The consequences of this were twofold. For one, the automobile allowed what can be seen as a reduction of distance between places. This coupled with the idea that some people had of urban centers as places of filth and depravity (also de-segregation laws that were to become the norm) led to what is called the suburban flight movement of the 60s. Families left the city into this new utopian vision of the suburb, the american dream was achieved. City planners began structuring cities around this great invention called the automobile. Robert Moses in New York championed the creation of an interstate that was to connect the east and the west. Freeways became a means to access the old downtowns. People could live 40 minutes away from their place of employment and it didn't mater. All amazing right?\n\nThe other side of the story is that the introduction of infrastructure designed for the automobile and new cities literally built around this technology lost what is called in urban planning circles the 'human scale' Since it was thought that people would just drive everywhere, urban cores that were vibrant due to the interactions that business had with pedestrians walking by it began to lose popularity. It was replaced by the mall, an island of commercial space surrounded by miles of parking. The entire phenomenon of planning for the suburban lifestyle completely lost touch with how people experience the city. See, before, the streets were a vivid public sphere where people would go and meet others, where neighbors would know each other, where small business could thrive because you knew the owner, were all taken for granted. When designing for the automobile all of that was lost and our lifestyle became more segregated. That is why there is no sense of community in the suburb, just a plastic simulation of what we have been told success looks like in America. \n\nThe introduction of freways were another seemingly great idea, but what ended up happening is that they were placed in strategic locations that would segregate black neighborhoods from urban downtown areas. Look it up, this was such a common phenomenon. By putting these massive infrastructures surrounding the downtown areas, many downtowns lost all sense of vibrant occupation. By supposedly increasing accessibility, the downtown of many places became dead zones surrounded by freeways whose underside is only appealing to homeless people. And I haven't even touched on the issue of parking!\n\nAll this is the current state of where urban planning is today. People in the discipline are still trying to undo the damage that car centric culture did to our cities, yet it is often met with opposition by people who don't want to inconvenience themselves in the least bit. Truth is, this is a huge reason why global warming is an issue, why mom and pop shops are increasingly a relic of the past, and why historically black neighborhoods are still ghettoes to this day.", "created_utc": "1456023066.0", "edited": "False", "id": "d07pym8", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_46n73p", "parent_id": "t1_d06wwx3", "score": "5", "subreddit": "pics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u"}, {"author": "javier123454321", "body": "How do you go about informing yourself about issues in the world?

Vegas local here. When I  first heard that EDC was coming to Las Vegas I had recently gone to my first rave. All my friends wanted to go and do did I but we simply couldn't afford it. When it finally came to it, my sister and I were bored at home with nothing to do Friday night so we decided to check it out. After scoping it out we snuck in surprisingly easily and had the greatest time I've had in my life at a rave. It was beyond everything I had ever seen, and lost my girlfriend at the time for that night... So worth it. This was 11.\n\nNext year 2012 all my friends realized they couldn't miss out, and my new girlfriend had a ticket too. I also couldn't really afford it but I helped my friend sneak in on Friday. I had work Saturday so I lucked out (veterans will know why) and snuck in again Sunday. Flux pavilion's closing set at the circuit grounds as the sun came up gives me chills whenever I think about it.\n\nIn 2013 me and that girlfriend were in a rough place and on a break. We both had tickets (first year I bought them) and since we were with the same group of friends we hung out most of the time. We had been on a few month break but it was during EDC that I realized I wanted to be back with her. I don't think that without that energy our relationship would have made it. Who knows, everything about it was magical and we have been together since.\n\nIn 2014 I married her (not legally) under the electric sky. This was the best EDC so far, bigger, badder and the bass was deeper (and infected mushroom holy sh!t). I cannot think of a moment of that experience that I won't cherish for my whole life, which I will spend with that woman if it's the last thing I do. By this point we both knew what we want from life and each other and it was excellent. Perfect even.\n\nNow I graduated college and am going to graduate school out of state. I'm starting a new stage in life and I will likely never do Edc again. I have come to terms with that.

First off, i did not feel represented in this election. Another poster mentioned that student debt wasn't represented and wall street ceos are still not in jail somewhat infuriates me. Furthermore, the real issues that i would love to see addressed would be limiting the influence of corporate lobbying and real policy to do something significant about our environmental impact. The biggest impediment for the latter is the fact that our global economic situation favors cheap (often exploitative) labor at the expense of environmental degradation. This is a global issue, however the United states could set an example for the world to follow. An environmental tax could be a good place to begin but then there is the first issue. \n\nI see the government as a machine with the impediment to produce real change so long as it works within the framework that has progressively become more rigid as time has gone on. Couple that with the fact that police is becoming more militarized and we are being spied on at the federal level. I do not feel represented, i feel antagonized.\n\nThen comes your condescending remark of us millennials being a culture of instant gratification. We get it we are the worst generation. Like we had a say on what kind of world we were born to. The previous generations are at fault for creating the culture of political correctness and short sighted egotistical and unsustainable values for us to deal with. And that is fine, it was really convenient to ignore truths if they would have an impact to your quality of life when the problem could be pawned off to your grandchildren. But we don't have that luxury anymore. Have you read the UN environmental summit that demands urgent action? We do want rapid change because that is what we feel is required.

The post modern cannon says that modernism reduced reality to an over simplified model which selectively chooses which issues to represent. It is therefore an incomplete model to deal with the complex nature of contemporary problems.\n\n Deconstructivism emerged out of thinkers that argued that the debate of form has been tirelessly pursued and it no longer performs a relevant task in architecture. The new paradigm, they argued separated the form and function dichotomy into its constituent parts thus allowing formal expression and exploration (some argue this is done for its own sake). The result is in creating interest and challenging semiotic concepts traditionally found in design. Does a room constitute of walls, floors, and ceiling?

One day I sat next to her and we started talking. It was really easy to talk to her and she was smart and funny. Next week I asked her if she would go have lunch with me after class. That is when I first found out she had a boyfriend. We continued this informal relationship and allowed it to build up some serious sexual tension as we would find more and more reasons to spend time with each other.  Talking led to flirting for a month or so until one day we finally did it. I could have probably done it sooner but I didn't want to put her in an awkward situation as I genuinely liked this girl, and didn't really want to risk losing what I can only describe as a really good friendship. After the first time, we started doing it like sexually deprived bunnies.\n\nShe would talk to me about her relationship with her boyfriend and how unsatisfied she was with him. It seemed as though they were just not in the same page as to what they wanted. She would complain about him not allowing her to smoke pot (which I did A LOT at the time) and just not sharing some pretty rooted interests like traveling and seeing the world outside their home town. I would like to think that we were simply more compatible. She dumped him a month or two afterward.\n\nAnyway, almost 3 years later and I still fucking love this girl, and I trust her. Is there jealousy? Yes. Are we in a perfect relationship? No. But she is the only person that has made me consider marriage in my life.

I trust her, and I get a good sense that the feeling is reciprocated.

Your brother does not deserve to be disrespected in the manner which you are doing because you 'feel like you need to find out'.
