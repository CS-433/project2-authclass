There are no toxic heterosexual relationships portrayed? Never?\n\n>Remember a parents number one priority is to protect their child and they will do anything to keep their child safe. If you do not allow the parent to trust you and see you as a non-threat then they will become homophobic and either have their children grow to be homophobic or make their child miserable because they might be homosexual. \n\nSo, because people love someone that might not be the \"normal setting\" to you, it means that their child is not safe. Based solely on the fact that people are LGBT, they are a danger to children? Why would LGBT not be trusted around kids? Why? LGBT people just happen to be in relationships that is not just p-n-s and v-g-n-. And if you believe that parents should trust every heterosexual out there, you are gonna be in for a big surprise. \n\n>NEVER show a child something you wouldn\u2019t want the parent to see.\n\nSo you don't want parents to see two human beings loving each other, grat I'll show the children a heterosexual beating another heterosexual because they love each other so much, because as you claim the heterosexuals won't have to \"earn the trust\" of parents. \n\nI'm not sure who hurt you, but try to see people who identify as LGBT as people, just like the heterosexuals. (Btw, do you know heterosexual is a sexual orientation as well? If not woohoo, exciting). \n\nChildren see many, many heterosexuals around them on a day to day basis, whether it be the parents, grandparents, neighbors, parents of children they play with and on TV. THERE ARE ALSO CHILDREN GROWING UP WITH TWO MOMS, TWO DADS, TWO PARENTS, A MOM AND A PARENT OR A DAD AND A PARENT, and that is only the families in which children have two parents. \n\nIf they know about these relationshios they are certainly old enough to know that other forms of love are possible as well.", "created_utc": "1665525860.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iry3ows", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_y0y8vp", "parent_id": "t3_y0y8vp", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TrueUnpopularOpinion", "subreddit_id": "t5_lrajx"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "You didn't upset me, you suggested that a victim of SA should try another sexual act.

Joe also runs a home based business as a fitness instructor. The way I understand it, he has his basement and backyard full of equipment and people pay him in either groups or as individuals for training in his basement. \n\nPersonally, before going to pay any amount of money for using a facility I would check the arrangements, whether it was a solid or shady business, and what not. I assume that people are paying because they like it there. Also, Joe and his wife split a year ago. \n\nIn this part there are no questionable ethics on Joe's part. Do you?\n\n>My wife took part as part of a group this summer, the sessions were at 7:30 am, and she told me one day that as she was arriving, a different colleague of hers (female, middle-aged, also a client of his) came walking out of his Kitchen having a coffee, clearly having spent the night. The thing is, this woman just split with her husband 4 weeks earlier. Now I don't have evidence, but it seems to me that due to only 4 weeks passing and she is already announcing to colleagues that they are sleeping together, they very likely had something before she split with her husband and it very likely was a contributing factor in her split from her family (hence the term homewrecker). \n\nOP's wife witnessed an event of her colleague \"clearly\" having spent the night at Joe.\n\nWhat follows is a judgement on OP's side about the divorce of this female, middle-aged, also a client of his [Joe's]-colleague of his wife, as indicadeted by the \"the thing is\" and one \"I don't have evidence\", followed by a \"but it seems to me that\", right before the \"they very likely had\" and ending with an \"and it very likely was\". \n\nSo, to OP it seems that only because he has known for 4 weeks that this colleague of his wife had split with her husband, it is most plausible that they were sleeping together, they slept together before the split and it most plausible was a contributing factor in the split of this colleague and her husband and family. \n\nNow, that's a pretty big conclusion to draw based on conjecture and without evidence. And in addition, this colleague was not \"announcing to colleagues that they are sleeping together\". This colleague was spotted while walking out of the kitchen having a coffee. OP and his wife don't even have evidence of Joe and the colleague \"clearly\" spending the night together. \n\nUp to this point, especially OP seems to be quite judgmental about what Joe is doing in his free-time. We have no proof of all these things OP claiming to be real. Yet, Joe is the one being called a homewrecker at this point in the story. And the colleague is deemed the party being at fault for the split with her husband, of which I also have seen no proof. \n\nSo, again, no, I don't think Joe has exhibited questionable ethical behavior in this part. If you do think so, please explain them to me!\n\n>Fast forward 4 weeks, my wife tells me she wants to go with a friend 2 evenings per week to this guys place to work out with him in his basement. At first I said that I was not going to say no, but after thinking about it for a couple days I told my wife I didn't like it and I wasn't comfortable with it. Well she goes ahead and signs up anyway (after I told her I wasn't comfortable with it), she doesn't tell me until an hour before the first session. \n\nI think it is good that OP has boundaries and that he feels safe enough to communicate them to his wife. But, OP was already from the start thinking about saying yes or no to this decision. To me, this indicates that OP thinks his wife is asking if she can go the this work out. Yet, in the first sentence, his wife is telling him she wants to go, not asking if OP gives her permission to go. \n\nAs Joe is not mentioned in this part I don't see any reason why he would have demonstrate questionable ethics. Do you?\n\n>Well I was quite pissed and we had a fight. She ended up canceling the workout sessions but only did it because I basically told her to. She doesn't think anything is wrong with it and thinks I'm wrong here. It's been 2 weeks and we have been cold and distant ever since.\n\nShe cancelled the work out because OP told her to. Here his wife clearly thinks nothing is wrong with working out at Joe's place. They have been distant and cold towards each other for 2 weeks, that is a really long time. Why not communicate with each other about why OP feels uncomfortable and how it can be fixed?\n\n>So, AITA?\n\nYes, OP is TA.\n\n>EDIT for more info. I asked my wife if she thinks thw guy was moving on the woman while she was still married and she agrees its likely. \n\nHere, it still is about what they think what was happening at the time. There is still no trace of proof for whatever OP is claiming. And we don't know when OP asked her this question. Was it when it first happened? OP never specified in the post whether or not he and his wife talked about this when it happened. We only know that OP's wife told him one day about this event between her, the colleague, and maybe Joe? From that point OP talks about what he thought. Not if he communicated it to his wife. \n\nMaybe he asked it 4 weeks after the event. When she was signing up for another round of work outs. When she felt comfortable in this place to do a work out. I didn't get any indication that OP's wife was in the same mindset as OP about Joe. Only after their fight OP sheds any light on how his wife is communicating about her feelings for Joe. Clearly, \"[s]he doesn't think anything is wrong with it\". \n\nSo, we have no clue at which point in time OP's wife was of the opinion that \"she agrees its likely\".\n\n>I also asked my wife if the roles were reversed and I was working out with a female colleague, in her basement and it was assumed she slept with a married guy at my work contributing to a divorce if she would be comfortable with it, and she wouldn't say either way.\n\nAgain, there is a whole lot of conjecture and what-if's going on here. BUT if this is how they both feel while being that distant from the evidence of truth, OP and his wife should really be talking about why these insecurities came up in the first place. But that might just be my opinion, so yeah.\n\n>Again, while I understand it doesn't come off that way, I trust my wife, I don't trust the guy and just didn't like the situation.\n\nI personally belief that actions speak louder than words. OP states he trusts his wife, yet his wife cancelled the work out solely because OP told her to. And the only reason OP gave us for this action is that it seems to him that Joe slept with a single woman who broke her whole family apart because they had been sleeping together before! \n\nNo, I do not think Joe's ethics are questionable. Do you think Joe's ethics are questionable?", "created_utc": "1665088378.0", "edited": "False", "id": "irbruxg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_xx5dai", "parent_id": "t1_irbcp0i", "score": "2", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "I'm not trolling anyone, I honestly think that trust is the answer here.

Her words are, to me, less important than her actions.\n\nOP's wife did not cheat, at least not that we and I think OP know of. It seems to be that there has been nothing in the past of OP's relationship and the past of OP's wife that indicates OP has a reason to distrust her. Op and his wife THINK Joe gives off the vibes of a whomewrecker apparently but yet we have NO proof of him being that. We know he has a sexual relationship with a single, consenting adult. We have no clue when their relationship started and whehter the woman only announces the divorce three weeks ago.\n\nDespite the absence of proof OP and his wife got the homewreckers vibes from Joe, yet she is comfortable enough to go to his house to work out. I have not the female gym experiences many, many females on this planet do have, but the general fingerspitzengef\u00fchl I have is that women would avoid a gym if they were uncomfortable and not forced to be there. So, to me, it seems like it that OP's wife whether does not feel this way about Joe being a homewrecker, or OP's wife trusts herself enough to be around Joe without falling in his homewrecking trap.\n\nSo, does OP trust the judgement of his wife about herself, there is no need to worry. If OP does not trust the judgement of his own wife, the question is why not? \n\nAnd to add: if OP has reason to not trust his wife's judgement because of something we don't know, he should have brought it up in the post though. That would have been important info for a more unbiased vote\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust wanted to add something that I forgot to mention:\n\nYou stated that it seems I'm suggesting that \"her words are more important than her actions\". No, that is not what I suggested. \n\nHer words are more important than Joe's actions. \n\nOr that would be the case if there were any actions in the first place here.

Normally this is seen in a positive way, as seen by the synonyms that all share a positive vibe (to me, but non native). So, translated back to term \"Golden star gay\", it means the people who (proudly) claim to be that person feel that they have done something worthy of an award (as is stated above: \"to be lauded or awarded for doing something\").\n\nBut it also means that these men have done something different than other people, something different than other men who have also slept with other men. Otherwise gay wouldn't be included in the term. So by doing something different than these other men, namely sleeping with only men, you are worthy of an award. So, yes, some gay men might feel proud in wearing the title, but it still is a really weird flex to make and it is problematic about being that proud of it and by awarding yourself this title, these men are putting themselves on a higher podium because other gay men didn't, couldn't or wouldn't do the same as them. \n\nThey were not worthy of being awarded a golden star.\n\nAnd to conclude, I'll include this quote by David Kaufman:\n\n\"It\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong\u2014or necessarily right\u2014about gays or lesbians who\u2019ve only gone horizontal with their own gender. After all, same-sex attraction is at the core of LGBT identity.\n\nThe problem is that qualifying sexual histories with terms like \u201cGold Star\u201d adds a level of competitiveness to LGBT identity that\u2019s not only inane\u2014it\u2019s downright divisive.\n\n[...]\n\nNot every gay person has had the ability\u2014or, yes, privilege\u2014to avoid \u201cperforming\u201d heterosexuality before they were able to come out. Indeed, for many young men and women, \u201cacting straight\u201d isn\u2019t just an expression of sexual ambiguity\u2014it\u2019s literally an act of survival. Embedded in communities where rejecting straightness can mean losing their families, jobs and even their lives, chasing some nebulous gilded star is as removed from their realities as\u2026well\u2026being a millionaire cable TV executive or heir to an American dynastic fortune.\"\n\nSources: https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/get+a+gold+star\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/award\nhttps://qz.com/quartzy/1164834/why-gold-star-gays-arent-a-good-thing/", "created_utc": "1662148532.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imu7zps", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x44n0r", "parent_id": "t1_imtn75g", "score": "4", "subreddit": "bisexual", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwnx"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "I dOn'T wAnT hEr At mY bAr... \n\nIt is not your bar buddy, it is your parents bar and you are costing them customers", "created_utc": "1662140451.0", "edited": "False", "id": "imtnsxj", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3iimi", "parent_id": "t3_x3iimi", "score": "6", "subreddit": "AmITheDevil", "subreddit_id": "t5_27t6v0"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "Haha well it did work then haha\n\nAnd I'm not saying children aren't allowed in the stiltecoupe, only children that can't bequite long enough", "created_utc": "1662115756.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ims3r9k", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3fmed", "parent_id": "t1_ims3840", "score": "8", "subreddit": "Netherlands", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ol"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "Ah makes sense haha no problem :) but you are very right indeed, the balcony is never part of the stiltecoupe!", "created_utc": "1662115555.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ims3gkg", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3fmed", "parent_id": "t1_ims2s7a", "score": "2", "subreddit": "Netherlands", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ol"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "Yes, that's why I said in the stiltecoupe, not on the balcony", "created_utc": "1662114833.0", "edited": "False", "id": "ims2ftx", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_x3fmed", "parent_id": "t1_imrzs3c", "score": "1", "subreddit": "Netherlands", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ol"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "I would classify this situation as acceptible because as you stated there was no way turning back.

Especially about something so small as wanting to travel alone after work.\n\nI was just so confused about our coworker being awkward about it hahaha. I knew what she meant, it didnt mean she never wants to interact with people, she just wanted to travel alone and be with herself. Being honest about this is so so important, but some people just don't get the importance of needing some alone time and be with your thoughts.\n\nAfter me and my travel buddy coworkers arrived at the busstop, we found our alone travel coworker, as there had not arrived a bus yet.

Bisexuality can mean:\u00a0\n\u2013 Attraction to the binary genders (men and women)\n\u2013 Attraction to all the genders and sexes\n\u2013 Attraction to your own and other genders\n\u2013 Attraction to other people regardless of their gender or sex\n\u2013 Attraction beyond gender\"\n\nBisexuality can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and there are also people who do not distinguish bisexual from pansexual and identify with both. However, there are also people who do feel they are only bisexual or only pansexual.\n\nSo you could see that as a second umbrella hanging under the umbrella, or on the same spectrum as bisexual!\n\nYou listed sapiosexual, while there is not one opinion within the LGBTQIA+ -community about whether or not they (completely) it in, there are many. Some people say that \"the term doesn\u2019t fit in description used by people who are marginalized the way all other sexual orientations or gender identities are\" while others, who do see them as part of the community, say that \"sapiosexuality can refer to a preference for highly intelligent partners or a type of pansexuality\u00a0where intelligence supersedes everything else and considers gender irrelevant.\"\n\nSo you could see that as a third umbrella hanging under the umbrella of bisexual & pansexual, or on the same spectrum as bisexual & pansexual.\n\nThe last one you listed is demisexual. \"Demisexual people tend to form a strong emotional connection or bond with someone before they experience sexual orientation.\" The umbrella of what you called none, asexual, is a bit a different umbrella from the other ones. Being asexual is the absence of sexual attraction, while allosexual people do feel sexual attraction. It, however, does not tell one anything about attraction to others, only that you feel this attraction. Asexuals can still feel romantic attraction towards one or multiple genders. \n\nDemisexual could maybe be put on the clothes line between the asexual umbrella and the umbrella above the 3 umbrellas that are allosexual!\n\nSorry for the long coment, I hope it helped a bit to navigate! \n\nSources:\nhttps://queerintheworld.com/what-does-bisexual-mean/\nhttps://queerintheworld.com/what-does-pansexual-mean/\nhttps://queerintheworld.com/what-does-sapiosexual-mean/\nhttps://queerintheworld.com/what-does-demisexual-mean/", "created_utc": "1659464869.0", "edited": "False", "id": "iiod1oi", "is_submitter": "False", "link_id": "t3_we548k", "parent_id": "t1_iimymos", "score": "1", "subreddit": "TrueUnpopularOpinion", "subreddit_id": "t5_lrajx"}, {"author": "maureen_leiden", "body": "A person born in a body that fits their assigned gender at birth.

This friend was also on that weekend, as well as a third friend. My exfriend and the third friend were not close as the exfriend saw the third friend as trying to steal my friendship with the exfriend away, like I was their property as friend.

When I talked to the exfriend and asked if she maybe saw an opportunity to help the second friend she scolded at me and gaslighted me into being a bad person even daring to ask this. She was full blown angry and yelling for this genuine question, WHILE I TOOK CARE OF THEIR BUNNY.\n\nThe end of this friendship was a complete relieve of stress and drama.

For 8 years straight I thought we were good friends and fought a common cause. Many times we were the center of drama (we got to know each other through a student association) and I frankly thought that everyone hated us for trying to do our best for the association.\n\nThen in one week my mom got very sick (agrissve type of breast cancer) and my stepdad died of lungcancer. I became my moms caretaker for 6 months before she went living with my grandparents. During these six months not once did they ask how I was doing or how my mom was doing. Two months later I told them in like a sort of break up that we couldnt be friends anymore. With this friend it was always you are with me or you are against me, but if being with yourself is not the same as being with me, you're always against me sort of BS.\n\nLast week I was at a funeral of a parent of one of our friends from the association and they weren't there but other people from the association were.
